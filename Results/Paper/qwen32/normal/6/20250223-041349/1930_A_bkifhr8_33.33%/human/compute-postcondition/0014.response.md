Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is `ans` + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1])), `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, `lst` is a list of 2n strings, each representing one of the integers from `l`, and the length of `lst` is equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any of the variable values; it only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values, and the program execution is terminated at this point.
