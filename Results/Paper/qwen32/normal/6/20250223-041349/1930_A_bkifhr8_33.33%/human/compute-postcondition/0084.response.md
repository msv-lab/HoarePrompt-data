The code snippet `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the minimum of the first two elements of the list `lst` (after converting them to integers).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50
- `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7
- `l` is a string input by the user
- `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces
- `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans` + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))]

After executing the code, the value of `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans` + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))]**
