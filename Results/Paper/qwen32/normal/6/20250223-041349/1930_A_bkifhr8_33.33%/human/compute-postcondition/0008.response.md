Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `lst` is a list of 2n strings, each representing one of the integers from `l`. The length of `lst` is not equal to 2. `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user.**
