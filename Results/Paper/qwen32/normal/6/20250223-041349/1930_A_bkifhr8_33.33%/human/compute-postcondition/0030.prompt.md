Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, `lst` is a list of 2n strings, each representing one of the integers from `l`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, and `lst` is a list of 2n strings, each representing one of the integers from `l`. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, then `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of the original `lst` and `lst` is a list of 2n-2 strings after removing the element at index 2. If the length of `lst` is equal to 2, then `ans` is `ans` plus the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of `lst`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` is a list of 2n-2 strings after removing the element at index 2, and `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of the original `lst`. If the length of `lst` is equal to 2, `lst` remains a list of 2n strings, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user. If the length of `lst` was not equal to 2, `lst` is a list of 2n-2 strings after removing the element at index 2, and `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` based on the original `lst`. If the length of `lst` was equal to 2, `lst` remains a list of 2n strings, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
