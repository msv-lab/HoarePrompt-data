The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n * 2`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. Since the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < n * 2`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, `i` becomes 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is part of the loop's range definition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the single element 0, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` has the first and third elements removed. `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of the original `lst` converted to integers if the length of `lst` is not 2; otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`.**
