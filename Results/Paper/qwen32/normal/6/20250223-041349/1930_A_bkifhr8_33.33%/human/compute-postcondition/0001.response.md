The provided code snippet initializes an empty list `ans_f`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user (1 <= `t` <= 5000); `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7; `ans_f` is an empty list.**
