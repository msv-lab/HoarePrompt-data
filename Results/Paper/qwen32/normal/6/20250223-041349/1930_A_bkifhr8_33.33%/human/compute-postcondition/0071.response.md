The code snippet `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` evaluates to 2) from the list `lst`. 

Given the initial state, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces, with the first element removed. The length of `lst` is not equal to 2, so removing an element at index 2 is valid.

`ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of the modified `lst` converted to integers. After the removal of the element at index 2, `ans` remains unchanged because it is derived from the first two elements of `lst`, which are not affected by the removal of the element at index 2.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`], `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed and the element at index 2 removed, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of the modified `lst` converted to integers, and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2.**
