The given Python code snippet modifies the `ans` variable by adding the minimum value between the two integers obtained from splitting the string `l` by spaces. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`], `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and contains exactly 2 elements, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`**

In simpler terms, the variable `ans` is now the minimum of the two integers obtained from splitting the string `l` by spaces. All other variables retain their initial values.
