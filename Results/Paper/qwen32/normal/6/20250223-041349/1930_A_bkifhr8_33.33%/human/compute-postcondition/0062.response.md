The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the loop iterates `t` times. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n * 2 - 1`, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `i` should be less than `t`.

Since `i` is currently `n * 2 - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n * 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`], `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is either an empty list or a list of two elements, `ans` is the sum of the minimums of all pairs of elements processed.**
