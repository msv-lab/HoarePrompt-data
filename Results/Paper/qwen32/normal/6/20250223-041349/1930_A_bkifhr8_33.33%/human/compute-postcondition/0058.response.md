Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, `l` is the string input by the user, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
