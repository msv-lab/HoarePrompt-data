The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it is used in the range function with `n * 2`. To ensure the loop executes, `n * 2` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 0. Given that `n` is already defined as an integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 50`, this condition is already satisfied. 

However, the initial value of `i` is given as `n * 2`, which means that `i` is already at the boundary condition for the loop to start (i.e., `i` is equal to the start of the range). To ensure the loop executes, `i` should be adjusted to be less than `n * 2` before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted so that `i` is less than `n * 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is the new integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`], `l` is the new string input by the user, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans` is 0**
