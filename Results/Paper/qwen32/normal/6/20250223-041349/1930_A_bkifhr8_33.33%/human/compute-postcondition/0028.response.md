Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, `lst` is a list of 2n-2 strings after removing the element at index 2 if its length was not equal to 2, or a list of 2n strings if its length was equal to 2, `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of the original `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
