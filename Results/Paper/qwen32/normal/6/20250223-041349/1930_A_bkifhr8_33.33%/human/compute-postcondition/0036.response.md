The code snippet splits the string `l` by spaces and assigns the resulting list to `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the single element 0, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans` is 0**.
