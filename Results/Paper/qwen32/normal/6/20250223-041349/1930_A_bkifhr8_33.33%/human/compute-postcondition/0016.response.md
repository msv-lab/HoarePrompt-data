The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range `n * 2`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, and `lst` is a list of 2n strings, each representing one of the integers from `l`. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, then `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of the original `lst` and `lst` is a list of 2n-2 strings after removing the element at index 2. If the length of `lst` is equal to 2, then `ans` is `ans` plus the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of `lst`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
