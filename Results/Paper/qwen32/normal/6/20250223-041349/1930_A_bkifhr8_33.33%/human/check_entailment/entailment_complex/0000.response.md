### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem as described. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Pair Removal**: 
   The code attempts to remove elements from the list `lst` using indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2`, which simplifies to `0` and `2`, respectively. This is incorrect because after removing the first element, the indices of the remaining elements shift, and the second element is no longer at index `2`. Instead, it should remove the first two elements of the list.

2. **Inefficient Pair Selection**:
   The strategy to maximize the score is to always select the smallest two numbers available in the list. This can be efficiently done by sorting the list first and then pairing the smallest numbers together. The current implementation does not sort the list, so it does not guarantee that the smallest possible numbers are being paired.

3. **Logic Error in Loop**:
   The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is not correctly checking when the list has only two elements left to be processed. The loop should continue until all elements are paired, and the condition should be `while len(lst) > 0:`.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the list to pair the smallest numbers together
        lst.sort()
        
        # Pair the smallest numbers and add the minimum of each pair to the score
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original code does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest numbers. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
