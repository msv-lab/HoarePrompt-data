You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then calculates the sum of the minimums of all pairs of integers from the list and prints this sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the maximum final score. The core issue lies in how the program selects pairs of numbers and calculates the score. The program attempts to remove elements from the list `lst` using indices that are incorrectly calculated, leading to incorrect or unexpected behavior.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Indexing in Removal:**
   ```python
   lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
   lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
   ```
   The indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always `0` and `2`, respectively. This means the program will incorrectly attempt to remove elements at fixed indices, which is not the intended behavior. The program should remove the first two elements of the list after processing them.

2. **Handling of List Length:**
   The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect. The program should always process pairs of numbers until the list is empty. The correct condition should be `while lst:` or `while len(lst) > 1:`.

3. **Incorrect Pair Selection:**
   The program does not sort the list before processing it, which is necessary to ensure that the smallest elements are always paired together to maximize the score. The optimal strategy is to sort the list and then sum the first `n` elements (which will be the smallest `n` elements after sorting).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        for j in range(n):
            ans += lst[j * 2]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version sorts the list and then sums the first `n` elements, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
