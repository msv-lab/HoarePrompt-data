To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided loop and the states after the first three iterations.

The loop provided in the code snippet is:
```python
for i in ans_f:
    print(i)
```

This loop iterates over each element in the list `ans_f` and prints it. Given that `t` is the length of `ans_f`, the loop will execute exactly `t` times.

From the output states after the first three iterations, it is clear that the loop has already processed all elements in `ans_f` up to the third element after three iterations. Since the loop iterates over each element in `ans_f`, and it has executed three times, it implies that `t` must be 3.

Thus, after all iterations, the loop will have printed all `t` elements in `ans_f`. Since `t` is 3, the loop will have printed the first three elements of `ans_f`.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be that all elements in `ans_f` have been printed. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `l`, `lst`, etc.) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

Output State: **All elements in `ans_f` have been printed.**

In natural language: After all iterations, the loop will have printed each element in the list `ans_f`, and no further changes will occur to the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, or `lst`.
