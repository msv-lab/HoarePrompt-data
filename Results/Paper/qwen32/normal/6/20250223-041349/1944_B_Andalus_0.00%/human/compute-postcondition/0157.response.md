Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element plus `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, and `n` must be greater than 4. `i` is 4. `rdb` has `rgt[4]` appended to it.**

In natural language: The list `lft` remains sorted and unchanged. The list `ldb` continues to contain all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, plus `rgt[4]` if `rgt[4]` is equal to `rgt[3]`. The list `sng` retains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors. The value of `n` remains greater than 4, and `i` remains 4. The list `rdb` now includes `rgt[4]` appended to it.
