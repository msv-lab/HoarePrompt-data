Postcondition: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains at least one more unique element in `lft` that is not the same as its immediate neighbors, `rdb` remains unchanged, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
