The code snippet `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`. Given the initial state, the values of `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `n` remain unchanged. The only change is that `rdb` now includes the element `rgt[i]` at the end of it.

Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element plus `rgt[i]`, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `n` must be greater than 1, and `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`. `rdb` now includes `rgt[i]` at the end.**
