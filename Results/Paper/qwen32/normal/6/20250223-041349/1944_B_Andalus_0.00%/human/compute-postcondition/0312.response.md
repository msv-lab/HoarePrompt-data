To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `elem` from the `sng` list. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them.
   - `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them and must have at least 1 element.
   - `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them.
   - `n` and `k` are input values.
   - `lst` is the input list of integers.
   - `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
   - `sz` is the smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k` plus 2.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
   - The loop will break if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `sng`.
   - At the end of the current iteration, `elem` has been processed.
   - For the next iteration, `elem` should be the next element in `sng`.

3. **Determine the New `elem`**:
   - Since `sng` is a list of elements that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them, and it must have at least one element, we need to ensure that `sng` still has elements left to process.
   - The next `elem` in the next iteration will be the next element in `sng` after the current `elem`.

Given the above, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them and must have at least 1 element; `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `sz` is the smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k` plus 2; `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.** 

However, to be more specific about the change in `elem`:
- If the current `elem` was the first element in `sng`, the next `elem` will be the second element in `sng`.
- If `sng` had only one element, then `sng` would be empty in the next iteration, and the loop would terminate.

Therefore, the more precise state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them and must have at least 1 element; `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `sz` is the smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k` plus 2; `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the current `elem`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
