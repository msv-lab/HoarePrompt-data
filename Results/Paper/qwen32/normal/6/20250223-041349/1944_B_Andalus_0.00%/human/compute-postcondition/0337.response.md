To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`rdb`**: The precondition states that `rdb` must not be empty. However, `rdb` is not directly used in the `print` statement, so we don't need to know its specific contents to determine the output of the print statement.
2. **`sz` and `k`**: The precondition mentions conditions related to `sz` and `k`, but these are not directly used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement does not reference these variables.
3. **`elem`**: The `print` statement references `elem` twice. Since `elem` is not defined in the provided initial state, we need to infer that `elem` must be defined in the context where this `print` statement is executed (likely within a loop or a function where `elem` is assigned a value).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```
- **`elem`**: This variable is printed twice.
- **`end=' '`**: This specifies that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline character.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and followed by a space. Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it as the value of `elem` at the point of execution.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the value of elem at the point of execution)**
