Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them and must have at least one element, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries, `sz` is unchanged or increased by 2 depending on the condition `k - sz >= 2`, `elem` is the next element in `ldb` after the current one. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no specific changes occur beyond the possible increase in `sz`. `sz` is now `sz + 2`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sz` has been increased by 2, while all other variables remain unchanged.
