To determine the final output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior and constraints of the loop. The loop iterates over the elements in `ldb`, printing each element twice and incrementing `sz` by 2 each time, until `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`.

### Analysis of the Loop:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until `sz` is no longer less than `k` or `ldb` is exhausted.
2. **Iteration Behavior**: For each element in `ldb`, if `k - sz` is at least 2, it prints the element twice and increments `sz` by 2.
3. **Termination**: The loop terminates if either `sz` reaches `k` or there are no more elements in `ldb` to process.

### Given Information:
- The loop has executed 3 times, which means `sz` has been incremented by 2 three times, resulting in `sz = 6`.
- The loop will continue until `sz` is no longer less than `k`.

### Final Output State:
- If `k` is less than or equal to 6, the loop would have already terminated after the third iteration.
- If `k` is greater than 6, the loop would continue to process more elements in `ldb` until `sz` reaches `k` or `ldb` is exhausted.

### Conclusion:
Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `k`, we can only determine the final state based on the condition that `sz` will be at least 6 after the third iteration. If `k` is greater than 6, `sz` will continue to increase in multiples of 2 until it reaches or exceeds `k`.

Given that the loop has already executed 3 times, the final value of `sz` will be 6 if `k` is 6 or less. If `k` is greater than 6, `sz` will be the next multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k`.

### Output State:
Assuming the loop has executed all iterations and `k` is the value that determines the termination:

**Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them; `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `sz` is the smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `sz` will be the smallest even number that is at least as large as `k`.
