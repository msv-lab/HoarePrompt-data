Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, `rdb` must contain at least one element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the variables `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `sz`, and `rdb` retain their initial values and properties. The code execution results in breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
