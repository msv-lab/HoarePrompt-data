The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` and the iterable `sng`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng` and the variable `elem`. For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have more elements, and `elem` should be the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least one element, and `sz` is incremented by 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have more than one element, and `elem` should be the next element in the list.

State: **`sng` is a list with at least two elements; `sz` is incremented by 1; if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
