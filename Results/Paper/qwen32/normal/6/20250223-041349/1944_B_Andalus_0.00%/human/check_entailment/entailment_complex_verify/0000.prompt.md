You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The loop will have printed the first `k` elements of the list `sng` (or the first `floor(k/2)*2` elements if `k` is odd) for both `lft` and `rgt`, and `sz` will be equal to `k` (or the largest even number less than or equal to `k` if `k` is odd) for both iterations of `lft` and `rgt`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `2n` integers. It then prints out `k` integers from the list, prioritizing pairs of identical numbers, and if necessary, single occurrences, from both the first half and the second half of the list separately.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements of `l` will be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of `r`. The code attempts to construct `l` and `r` by adding pairs of identical elements from the left and right halves of the input list, and then adding single elements if necessary. However, this approach does not ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` will match the XOR of the elements in `r`.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
The XOR of any two elements from the first half `[1, 2, 3, 4]` should match the XOR of any two elements from the second half `[4, 3, 2, 1]`. One possible correct output could be:
```
1 2
1 2
```
or
```
3 4
3 4
```
or any other valid pair that maintains the XOR equality.

**Actual Output from the Code:**
The code will output:
```
1 1 2 2
1 1 2 2
```
or some other pair of repeated elements, which does not necessarily satisfy the XOR condition.

The code does not attempt to match the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` directly. Instead, it just adds pairs of identical elements, which is not guaranteed to result in equal XOR values. Therefore, the code is incorrect for this problem description.

A correct approach would involve ensuring that the XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of the elements in `r`. One possible way to achieve this is by using a greedy approach or a backtracking method to find such subsets.
