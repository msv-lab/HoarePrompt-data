Output State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, and `sz` is a positive value equal to its previous value plus 2.**

In natural language: The `sz` variable has been increased by 2. The conditions that `rdb` must not be empty and `sz` is less than `k` remain valid. Additionally, the condition `k - sz` is still greater than or equal to 2 after the increment.
