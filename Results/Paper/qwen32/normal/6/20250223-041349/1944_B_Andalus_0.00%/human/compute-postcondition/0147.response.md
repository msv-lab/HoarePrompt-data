Postcondition: **`lft` is a list, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` remains the same. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element `lft[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, no additional elements are appended to either `ldb` or `sng`.**
