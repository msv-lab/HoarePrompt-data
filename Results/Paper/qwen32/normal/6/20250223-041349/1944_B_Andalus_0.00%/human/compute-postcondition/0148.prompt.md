Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All elements of `sng` up to the index `min(k, len(sng)) - 1` are printed, `sz` is equal to `min(k, len(sng))`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lft` is a list, and `i` is an index such that `i` is greater than 0. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` has an additional element which is the value of `lft[i]`. Otherwise, if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` includes `lft[i]` at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lft` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element `lft[i]` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `lft` is a list, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` remains the same. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element `lft[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, no additional elements are appended to either `ldb` or `sng`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
