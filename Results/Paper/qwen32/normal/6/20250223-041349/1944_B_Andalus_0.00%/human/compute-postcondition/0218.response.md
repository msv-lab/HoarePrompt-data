Given the initial state, we know that `rdb` must contain at least one element, and `elem` is the next element from `rdb`. The variables `sz` and `k` are mentioned in the context of a loop or conditional statement, but their specific values and the logic that involves them do not directly affect the `print` statement in question. The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not include a newline character at the end due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `rdb` is a list that contains at least one element.
2. `elem` is assigned the next element from `rdb`. Since `rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` will have a defined value.
3. The `print` statement outputs `elem` twice, separated by a space, and does not end with a newline character.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe its value in terms of its definition. The output will be the value of `elem` repeated twice.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element from rdb)**
