The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will exit the innermost loop it is contained within. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `sng`, `sz`, and `elem` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sng` is a list with at least two elements, `sz` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `k`, `elem` is the next element in the list `sng` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
