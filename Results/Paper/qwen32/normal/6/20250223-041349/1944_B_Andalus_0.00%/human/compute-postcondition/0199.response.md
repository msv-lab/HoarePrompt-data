The provided Python code snippet contains an empty `print()` statement, which means it will not print anything specific. 

Let's break down the initial state to ensure we understand the context:

- `lft` is a sorted list and remains unchanged.
- `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element.
- `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors.
- `sz` is defined as `k` or the number of elements in `sng` if `k` is greater than the number of elements in `sng`.

However, since the `print()` statement is empty, it will simply output a newline character without any specific variable values or strings.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **(newline)**

Since there is nothing inside the `print()` function, it results in an empty output, which is represented as a newline in the console.
