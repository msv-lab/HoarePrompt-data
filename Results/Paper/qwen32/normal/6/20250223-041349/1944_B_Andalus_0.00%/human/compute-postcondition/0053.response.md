Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000 (not directly used in the print statement).
- `T`: An integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000 (not directly used in the print statement).
- `n`: An integer greater than 1.
- `k`: The second integer from the input.
- `lst`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
- `lft`: A list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, sorted in ascending order.
- `rgt`: A list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.
- `ldb`: Contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them and must have at least one element.
- `rdb`: Contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them.
- `sng`: Contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries.
- `sz`: Unchanged or increased by 2 depending on the condition `k - sz >= 2`.
- `elem`: The next element in `ldb` after the current one.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no specific changes occur beyond the possible increase in `sz`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

#### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `elem`: The next element in `ldb` after the current one.

### Explanation:
- `elem` is an element from the list `ldb`, which contains elements from `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them.
- The print statement will output `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not end with a newline (due to `end=' '`).

### Output:
Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of its definition.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element in `ldb` after the current one)**
