Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `ldb` contains the element `lft[i]` appended to it, `rdb` remains unchanged. If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` includes the element `lft[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.**
