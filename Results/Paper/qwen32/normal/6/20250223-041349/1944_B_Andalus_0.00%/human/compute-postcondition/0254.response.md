The code snippet appends the element `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Since `sng` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `sng` will contain one element, which is `lft[i]`. The values of `lft`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `rgt`, and the conditions on `lft` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` is an empty list; `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]`; `rdb` is an empty list; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`; `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.**
