Postcondition: **`lft` is a list, and `i` is an index such that `i` is greater than 0. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` has an additional element which is the value of `lft[i]`. Otherwise, if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` includes `lft[i]` at the end.**
