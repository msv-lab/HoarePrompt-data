Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is 0, and the first `x` elements of `sng` have been printed where `x` is the number of iterations until `sz` reaches `k`.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rdb` must not be empty. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is a positive value equal to its previous value plus 2. Otherwise, there is no change to the state described by the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rdb` must not be empty. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2. If after this increase `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `k - sz` was less than 2, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rdb` must not be empty. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `k - sz >= 2`, `sz` is increased by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
