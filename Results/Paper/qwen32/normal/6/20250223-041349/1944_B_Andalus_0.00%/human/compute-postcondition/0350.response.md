Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `sng` is a list with at least two elements.
2. `sz` is incremented by 1 but is still less than `k`.
3. `elem` is the second element of `sng`.
4. The condition `sz >= k` is not met, so the code does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `sng` is a list with at least two elements. Let's denote the elements of `sng` as `[sng[0], sng[1], sng[2], ...]`.
- `elem` is specifically defined as the second element of `sng`, which means `elem = sng[1]`.
- The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Output:
Since `elem` is the second element of the list `sng`, the print statement will output this value followed by a space.

Output: **sng[1] ** (where `sng[1]` is the second element of the list `sng`)
