The code snippet provided appends the `i`-th element of the `lft` list to the `ldb` list. Given that `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, the `i`-th element being appended to `ldb` is the same as the previous element in `lft`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing `lft[i]` (which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`), `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list. Additionally, `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`.**
