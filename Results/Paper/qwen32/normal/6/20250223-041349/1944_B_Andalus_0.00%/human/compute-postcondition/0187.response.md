The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. The values of `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, and the condition that `sz` is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k` remain unchanged. The state of whether the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of is also not affected by this single increment.

Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors and must have at least 1 element, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k` plus 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.**
