The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `sng`. If there are more elements in `sng`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `sng` is a list with at least one element, and `sz` is incremented by 1. The condition for breaking out of the loop is if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still have more elements to iterate over, and `sz` must be less than `k`.

Since `elem` is the variable that takes on the value of each element in `sng` during each iteration, for the next iteration, `elem` should be the next element in the list `sng`.

State: **`sng` is a list with at least two elements; `sz` is incremented by 1 but is still less than `k`; `elem` is the second element of `sng`**
