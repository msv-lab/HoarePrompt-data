To determine the output of the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to understand the context and the state of the variables as described in the initial state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **List `lst`**: This is a list of integers provided as input.
2. **`n` and `k`**: These are values provided by the input.
3. **`lft`**: This is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
4. **`ldb`**: This list contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them.
5. **`sng`**: This list contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them and must have at least one element.
6. **`rgt`**: This is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
7. **`rdb`**: This list contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them.
8. **`sz`**: This is the smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k` plus 2.
9. **`elem`**: This is the next element in `sng` after the current `elem`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Key Points:

- `sng` is a list of elements from `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them.
- `elem` is an element from `sng`.
- The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the current `elem` followed by a space.

### Output:

Since the exact values of `lst`, `n`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, we know that `elem` is an element of the `sng` list, which contains elements from `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them.

Therefore, the output will be the current `elem` from the `sng` list, followed by a space.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the `sng` list after the current `elem`)**
