The value of `sz` is increased by 2. The other variables (`rdb`, `elem`, and the condition involving `k`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element from `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes are made. `sz` is increased by 2.**
