Postcondition: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains at least two elements that have duplicates immediately before them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them, `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is less than `k`, `sz` and `elem` remain unchanged because the `break` statement was not encountered. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the `break` statement was encountered and `sz` and `elem` remain unchanged.**
