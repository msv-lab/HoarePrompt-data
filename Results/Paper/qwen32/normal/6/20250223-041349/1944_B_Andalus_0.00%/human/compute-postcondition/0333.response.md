Postcondition: **`rdb` must not be empty. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2. If after this increase `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `k - sz` was less than 2, no change occurs.**
