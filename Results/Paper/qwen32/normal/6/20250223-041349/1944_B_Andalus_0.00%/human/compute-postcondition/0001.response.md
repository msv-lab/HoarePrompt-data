To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(T):`, which means the loop will execute `T` times. The only variable we can adjust here is `T`.

Given the state before the loop starts is that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000 and `T` is the input integer representing the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `T` is set to a value that will allow the loop to execute.

Since `T` determines how many times the loop will run, the loop will execute if `T` is greater than 0. Given that `T` represents the number of test cases, it makes sense to align `T` with `t` as they both seem to represent counts of something related to the test cases.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, `T` should be set to a value between 1 and 5000, inclusive.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000**
