### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and the list `a` of `2n` integers.
2. **Splitting the List**: It splits the list `a` into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`.
3. **Identifying Duplicates and Singles**: It identifies pairs of identical numbers (`ldb` and `rdb`) and single occurrences (`sng`) in `lft` and `rgt`.
4. **Constructing Subsets `l` and `r`**:
   - It starts by adding pairs of identical numbers to the subsets `l` and `r` until it reaches the required size `k`.
   - If it hasn't reached the size `k` after adding pairs, it adds single occurrences to the subsets.
5. **Output**: It prints the constructed subsets `l` and `r`.

### Analysis:

- **Pairs of Identical Numbers**: The program correctly identifies pairs of identical numbers in both halves of the list and adds them to the subsets `l` and `r`. This ensures that the XOR of the pairs is zero.
- **Single Occurrences**: If there are not enough pairs to reach the required size `k`, the program adds single occurrences. However, it adds the same single occurrences to both `l` and `r`, which means the XOR of `l` and `r` remains zero.
- **XOR Condition**: Since the XOR of identical numbers is zero, and adding the same single occurrences to both `l` and `r` does not change the XOR, the condition `l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k}` is always satisfied.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs subsets `l` and `r` such that their XOR values are equal, adhering to the problem's requirements. The execution summary aligns with the program's logic, and the program handles the given constraints effectively.

**Correctness: True**
