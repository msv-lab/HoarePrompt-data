The code snippet `lft = lst[:n]` slices the list `lst` from the beginning up to, but not including, the index `n`, and assigns this slice to the variable `lft`. This means `lft` will now hold the first `n` elements of `lst`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.**
