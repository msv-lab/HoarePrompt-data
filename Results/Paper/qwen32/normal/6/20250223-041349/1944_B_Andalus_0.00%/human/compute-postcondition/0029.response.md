To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze how the loop modifies the variables `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` based on the sorted list `lft`.

The loop iterates over the list `lft` from index 1 to `n-1`. During each iteration, it checks:
1. If the current element `lft[i]` is equal to the previous element `lft[i - 1]`, it appends `lft[i]` to `ldb`.
2. If the current element `lft[i]` is not equal to the previous element `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1`, and the current element `lft[i]` is not equal to the next element `lft[i + 1]`, it appends `lft[i]` to `sng`.

Let's summarize the final state after the loop completes:

- `ldb` will contain all the elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them.
- `rdb` remains an empty list throughout the loop, as it is not modified.
- `sng` will contain all the elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries (i.e., not the first or last element if they are unique).

Here's the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries.**

In simpler terms:
- `ldb` has all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of their preceding elements.
- `rdb` remains empty.
- `sng` has all unique elements in `lft` that are not the first or last element if they are unique.
