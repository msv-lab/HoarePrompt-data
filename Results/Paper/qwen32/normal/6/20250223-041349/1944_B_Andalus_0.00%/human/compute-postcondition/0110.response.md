Output State: **`sng` is a list with at least two elements; `sz` is incremented by 1; if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1 as specified in the initial state. The condition regarding `sz` and `k` remains the same, and since the `break` statement is executed, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The list `sng` remains unchanged.
