Postcondition: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is 0 if it was less than `k` before the if statement, otherwise `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `rdb` must contain at least one element. The current value of `sz` is such that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.**
