Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`**

Natural Language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The variable `temp` is assigned a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at `i + 3` (not inclusive). The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
