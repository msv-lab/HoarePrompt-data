Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `max` is the maximum second element found in any sorted sublist of `a` of length 3 during the loop execution. If `n` equals 2, the same conditions hold without any additional changes.**
