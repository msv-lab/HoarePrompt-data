Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it finds the maximum second smallest element in any contiguous subarray of length 3 from `a` and prints this value. If `n` is 2, it simply prints the minimum of the two elements.**
