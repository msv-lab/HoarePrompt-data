The `continue` statement in Python is typically used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables `t`, `n`, or `a`.

Given the initial state, none of the variables are affected by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer with the current value of 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
