Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, `a` is a new list of integers derived from the latest input, `max` is the maximum value among the second smallest elements of all possible sublists of length 3 in the new `a`. If `n` is equal to 2, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
