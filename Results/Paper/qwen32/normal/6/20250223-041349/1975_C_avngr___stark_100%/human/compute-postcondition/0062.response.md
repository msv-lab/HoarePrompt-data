The provided Python code snippet sorts the list `temp`. Since `temp` is a slice of the list `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, sorting `temp` will arrange its elements in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `max`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a new list of integers derived from the latest input, `max` is 0, `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
