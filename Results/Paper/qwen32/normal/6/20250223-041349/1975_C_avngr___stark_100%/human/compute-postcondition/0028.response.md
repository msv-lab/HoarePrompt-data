`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `a`, and `max` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is the maximum second element found in any sorted sublist of `a` of length 3 during the loop execution.
