The function `count_zero` is not correctly defined based on the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the list of integers, and the parameter `m` for each test case. A correct function definition would be `def determine_winner(test_cases)`, where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, and the list of integers `a`. Each `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, and the list `a` contains `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
