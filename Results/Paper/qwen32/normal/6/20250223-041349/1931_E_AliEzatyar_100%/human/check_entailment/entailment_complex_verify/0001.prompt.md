You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

    Sasha
    Anna

    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, taking turns to modify a list of integers. The objective is to determine who will win if both play optimally. The game rules are as follows:
1. **Anna's Turn**: She can reverse the digits of any integer in the list.
2. **Sasha's Turn**: He can concatenate any two different integers in the list and insert the result back into the list, removing the two original integers.
3. The game ends when only one integer remains in the list.
4. If the final integer is not less than \(10^m\), Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to determine the winner based on the number of digits in the integers and the number of trailing zeros in the integers. Here's a breakdown of the program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of integers \(n\) and the parameter \(m\). It also reads the list of integers.
2. **Digit Counting**: It calculates the total number of digits in all integers.
3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**: It calculates the number of trailing zeros in each integer and stores these counts in a list.
4. **Optimal Play Simulation**:
    - It sorts the list of trailing zeros in descending order.
    - It sums up every other element in the sorted list (starting from the first element). This is intended to simulate Sasha's optimal play, where he removes pairs of integers and concatenates them, effectively removing the maximum possible number of trailing zeros.
    - It then checks if the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of the selected trailing zeros is at least \(m + 1\). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Correctness Analysis
The program's logic is based on the assumption that Sasha can always concatenate integers in such a way as to maximize the removal of trailing zeros, which is a reasonable strategy for Sasha to win. However, the program does not account for all possible optimal moves that Anna can make. Specifically, Anna can reverse any integer, which could potentially increase the number of digits or change the number of trailing zeros in a way that the program does not consider.

For example, consider the test case:
```
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
The program calculates the total number of digits as 14 and the trailing zeros as [3, 1, 1, 0]. It sums every other element (3, 1) to get 4 and checks if \(14 - 4 \geq 6\), which is false, so it incorrectly concludes that Anna wins. However, Anna can reverse 5000 to 5, reducing the total number of digits to 11, and then Sasha can concatenate the remaining numbers to get a number with fewer than \(10^5\) digits, making Anna the winner.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly simulate all possible optimal moves for both players, particularly Anna's ability to reverse integers, which can affect the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros in unexpected ways. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
