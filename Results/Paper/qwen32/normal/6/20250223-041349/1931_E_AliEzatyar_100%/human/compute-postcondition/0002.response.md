Postcondition: **`num` is `[[3, 5, [1, 2, 3]]]`, `counter` is 0. The condition `num[i] == '0'` is true, meaning the element at index `i` in `num` is the string `'0'`. However, given the precondition, this condition cannot be true as `num` contains only integers and a nested list, not the string `'0'`. This implies that the code would not enter the if block under the given precondition, but if it did hypothetically, `num[i]` would be `'0'`.**
