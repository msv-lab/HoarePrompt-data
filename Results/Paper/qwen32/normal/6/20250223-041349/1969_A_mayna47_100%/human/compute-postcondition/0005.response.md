The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print(2)` statement. The initial state describes various variables and their properties, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, or `v`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 50.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `p_i` is between 1 and `n`, `p_i` is not equal to `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct.
   - `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, with the first element being 0 and the remaining `n` elements being the integers provided in the input. Additionally, `v[v[i]]` equals `i`.

2. **Analysis of the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print(2)` statement directly outputs the integer `2` to the console.
   - No variables or conditions from the initial state are involved in the `print` statement.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
