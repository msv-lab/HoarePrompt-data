Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
Monocarp wants to have at least 2 friends at his party. Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`, and the i-th friend will only come to the party if both the i-th friend and the `p_i`-th friend receive invitations. The goal is to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Key Observations
1. **Couples**: If there is a pair of friends `i` and `p_i` such that `p_i = j` and `p_j = i`, then inviting both `i` and `j` will ensure that both come to the party. This is the optimal case, and the answer would be 2.
2. **Triplets and More**: If no such pair exists, Monocarp needs to invite at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 of them and their best friends come to the party.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by checking if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints `3`.

Let's break down the code:
- The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
- It reads the number of friends `n` and the list `v` of best friends.
- It then iterates through the list to check if there is any `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`.
- If such an `i` is found, it means there is a pair of mutual best friends, and the function prints `2`.
- If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

### Correctness
The logic of the solution is correct based on the problem description. The code efficiently checks for the presence of a pair of mutual best friends and correctly handles the case where no such pair exists.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
