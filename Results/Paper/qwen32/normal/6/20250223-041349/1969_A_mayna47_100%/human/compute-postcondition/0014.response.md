Output State: **The program returns None**

Explanation: Since the code snippet provided is `return`, it means the function will return `None` by default. The conditions and constraints given in the initial state do not affect the return statement directly as there are no operations or changes made to the variables that would influence the return value. The function does not perform any checks or operations that would lead to a different return value other than `None`.
