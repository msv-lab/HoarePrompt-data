The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into multiple integers, and maps them to a tuple of integers. This lambda function does not modify any existing variables or states; it simply prepares for future input processing.

Given the initial state, which involves multiple test cases with arrays and queries, the lambda function `R` is now defined and ready to be used to read and process these inputs.

Output State: **The function `func` takes no direct input parameters. However, it is expected to read input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`. The next line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array. The following line contains an integer `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of queries. The next `q` lines each contain two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of each query. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The lambda function `R` is defined to read and map multiple integers from a line of input.**
