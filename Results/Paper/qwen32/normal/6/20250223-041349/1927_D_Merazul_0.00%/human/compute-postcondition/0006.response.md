The code creates a new set `b` from the elements of the iterable returned by `R()`. Since `a` is also a set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`, `b` will contain the same elements as `a` because sets created from the same iterable will have identical elements.

The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `k` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`; `a` is a set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`; `b` is a set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`.**
