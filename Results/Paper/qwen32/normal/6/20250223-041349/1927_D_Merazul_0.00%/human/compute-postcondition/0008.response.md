The code assigns the value of `k // 2` to both `m` and `n`. The value of `k` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, and `f`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `k` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`; `a` is a set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`; `b` is a set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`; `f` is 1; `m` is `k // 2`; `n` is `k // 2`.**
