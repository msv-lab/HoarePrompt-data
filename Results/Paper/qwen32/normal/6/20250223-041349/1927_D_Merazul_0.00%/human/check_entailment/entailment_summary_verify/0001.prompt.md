You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it processes two sets of integers `a` and `b`, and an integer `k`. It then determines if all integers from 1 to `k` are either in set `a` or set `b`, and if the counts of integers unique to `a` and unique to `b` are balanced according to specific conditions. The function outputs "YES" if these conditions are met, otherwise "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` within a specified range `[l, r]` such that the elements at these indices are different (`a_i ≠ a_j`). If no such pair exists, we need to report that by outputting `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for the following reasons:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program uses a lambda function `R` to read integers from input and splits them into a map.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` correctly.
   - It then reads the array length `n` and the array `a` correctly.
   - However, the program then reads `k` (which is actually the number of queries `q`) and attempts to read the queries into sets `a` and `b`. This is incorrect because the queries are pairs of integers `[l, r]`, not individual integers.

2. **Logic for Queries:**
   - The program initializes `f`, `m`, and `n` and iterates from `1` to `k`. The logic inside the loop seems to be trying to determine something about the presence of elements in sets `a` and `b`, but it does not relate to the problem of finding different elements in a specified range.
   - The print statement at the end attempts to output 'YES' or 'NO' based on some logic, which is not relevant to the problem's requirement of outputting indices `i` and `j` or `-1 -1`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program attempts to output 'YES' or 'NO' based on some condition, which does not match the problem's requirement to output indices `i` and `j` or `-1 -1`.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- For each test case, read the array and the number of queries.
- For each query, extract the subarray from `l` to `r`.
- Check if there are two different elements in this subarray.
- If such elements exist, output their indices. If not, output `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect as it does not correctly parse the input, does not implement the required logic to solve the problem, and does not produce the correct output format.

Correctness: **False**
