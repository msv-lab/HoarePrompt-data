### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by calculating a distribution of bets such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Calculate the Product of Multipliers (m):**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `k_i` for each test case. This product is stored in `m`.

2. **Calculate Individual Bets (c):**
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, the program calculates the corresponding bet `c_i` as `m / k_i`. This ensures that the sum of all bets `c_i` is equal to `m`.

3. **Find the GCD of Bets (hcf):**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the calculated bets `c_i`. This GCD is stored in `hcf`.

4. **Normalize the Bets:**
   - Each bet `c_i` is then divided by the GCD `hcf`. This step ensures that the bets are as small as possible while maintaining the property that the sum of the bets is less than `m / hcf`.

5. **Check Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, the bets are printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed, indicating that no valid distribution of bets is possible.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The key idea is to ensure that the sum of the bets `c_i` is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This is achieved by setting each `c_i` to `m / k_i`, where `m` is the product of all multipliers.
  - By dividing each `c_i` by the GCD of all `c_i`, the program ensures that the bets are minimized while still satisfying the condition.
  - The check `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` ensures that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, which is necessary for the solution to be valid.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where all multipliers are the same, resulting in a GCD equal to the multiplier itself.
  - It also handles cases where the multipliers are different, leading to a GCD of 1, which means the bets remain unchanged.
  - If the sum of the normalized bets is not less than `m / hcf`, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It calculates the bets in such a way that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and it handles edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
