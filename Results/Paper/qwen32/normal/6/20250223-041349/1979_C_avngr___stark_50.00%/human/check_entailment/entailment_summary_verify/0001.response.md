Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Formally, for each outcome `i`, the sum of all bets \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \) must be less than \( k_i \times x_i \).

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k`. This is essentially the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers if they were all distinct primes, but in general, it's the product of all multipliers.

3. **Calculating `c`:**
   - `c` is a list where each element `c[i]` is calculated as `m / k[i]`. This is the LCM of all multipliers except `k[i]`.

4. **Finding the HCF of `c`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the elements in `c`.

5. **Normalizing `c`:**
   - Each element in `c` is divided by the HCF of `c` to normalize the values.

6. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized `c` is less than `m / hcf`. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints the normalized `c` values.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary states that `func_1` calculates the GCD of a list of numbers. This is correct and matches the implementation of `func_1` in the program.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Conceptual Correctness:**
  - The idea is to find a set of bets `x_i` such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome. The program uses the product of the multipliers and divides it by each multiplier to distribute the bets in a way that satisfies the condition.
  - The normalization step ensures that the bets are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition.

- **Implementation Details:**
  - The program correctly calculates the product of the multipliers.
  - It computes the LCM of all multipliers except the current one for each outcome.
  - The HCF of these values is used to normalize the bets, ensuring that they are integers and as small as possible.
  - The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Edge Cases
- **All multipliers are the same:** If all multipliers `k_i` are the same, say `k`, then `c[i] = m / k = (k^n) / k = k^(n-1)`. The sum of `c` is `n * k^(n-1)`, and `m / hcf = k^n`. The condition `n * k^(n-1) < k^n` simplifies to `n < k`. If `n >= k`, the program will correctly return `-1`.
- **Distinct multipliers:** If the multipliers are distinct, the program will find a valid distribution of bets.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets or determine that no such distribution exists. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
