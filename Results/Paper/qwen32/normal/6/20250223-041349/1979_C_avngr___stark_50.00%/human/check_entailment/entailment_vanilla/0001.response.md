Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine how to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This means, for each outcome \(i\), the sum of all bets \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \) must be less than \( k_i \times x_i \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k`. This represents the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers if they were all distinct primes, but in general, it's just the product.

3. **Calculating `c`:**
   - `c` is a list where each element `c[i]` is calculated as `m / k[i]`. This essentially computes the LCM of all multipliers except `k[i]`.

4. **Finding the HCF of `c`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the elements in `c`.

5. **Normalizing `c`:**
   - Each element in `c` is divided by the HCF of `c` to normalize the values.

6. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized `c` is less than `m / hcf`. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints the normalized `c` values.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Conceptual Correctness:**
  - The idea behind the solution is to find a set of bets `x_i` such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome. The program uses the product of the multipliers and divides it by each multiplier to distribute the bets in a way that satisfies the condition.
  - The normalization step ensures that the bets are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition.

- **Implementation Details:**
  - The program correctly calculates the product of the multipliers.
  - It computes the LCM of all multipliers except the current one for each outcome.
  - The HCF of these values is used to normalize the bets, ensuring that they are integers and as small as possible.
  - The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If all multipliers are the same, the program will return `-1` because the sum of bets cannot be less than the return for any outcome.
  - If the multipliers are distinct, the program will find a valid distribution of bets.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets or determine that no such distribution exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
