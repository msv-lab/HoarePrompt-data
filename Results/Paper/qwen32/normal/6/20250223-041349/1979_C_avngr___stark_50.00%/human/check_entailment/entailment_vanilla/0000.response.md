Let's break down the logic of the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The goal is to find a set of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the total amount of coins bet (sum of all \( x_i \)) is strictly less than the amount received if any single outcome \( i \) wins (i.e., \( k_i \cdot x_i \)).

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating the Common Multiple**:
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `m = k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.

3. **Generating Initial Bets**:
   - It generates the initial bets \( c_i = \frac{m}{k_i} \). This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the total amount received is \( k_i \cdot c_i = m \).

4. **Finding the GCD**:
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all \( c_i \) values. This is done to reduce the bets to the smallest possible integers while maintaining the property that \( k_i \cdot c_i \) is the same for all \( i \).

5. **Reducing Bets**:
   - Each bet \( c_i \) is divided by the GCD, resulting in smaller bets that still satisfy the condition \( k_i \cdot c_i = \frac{m}{\text{GCD}} \).

6. **Checking the Total Bet**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than \( \frac{m}{\text{GCD}} \). If it is, the bets are printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed.

### Correctness of the Program

The logic of the program is correct based on the following points:
- The product `m` is a common multiple for all \( k_i \cdot c_i \).
- By reducing the bets using the GCD, the program ensures that the bets are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition.
- The check `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received if any single outcome wins.

However, there is a subtle issue with the condition `sum(c) < m / hcf`. The condition should be `sum(c) < m / hcf` to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. This condition is correctly implemented in the program.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find a suitable set of bets or determine that no such set exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
