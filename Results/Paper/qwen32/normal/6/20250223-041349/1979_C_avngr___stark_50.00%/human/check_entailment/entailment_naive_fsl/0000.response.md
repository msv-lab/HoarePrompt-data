Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by using the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) to distribute the bets. However, there are a few issues with the logic that make it incorrect for some cases.

1. **Logic for Finding Bets**:
   - The code calculates the LCM of the multipliers (`m`).
   - Then, it calculates the value of each bet as `m / k[i]` and divides it by the GCD of these values to reduce the size of the numbers.
   - The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` checks if the total sum of the bets is less than the reduced LCM. If not, it returns `-1`.

2. **Issue with the Condition**:
   - The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` is not correct. The sum of the bets (`sum(c)`) should be strictly less than the amount received in any winning scenario, which is `k[i] * c[i]` for each outcome.
   - The code does not ensure that `sum(c) < k[i] * c[i]` for all `i`.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     1
     3
     2 2 2
     ```
   - The LCM of `[2, 2, 2]` is `2`.
   - The bets calculated will be `[1, 1, 1]` (since `2 / 2 = 1` for each `k[i]`).
   - The sum of the bets is `3`, which is not less than `2 * 1 = 2` for any winning outcome. Hence, this should return `-1`, but the code will output `1 1 1`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would be to assign bets such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the minimum `k[i] * x_i` for any `i`.
   - One simple way to do this is to assign bets as `x_i = 1` for all `i` and check if `n < min(k_i)`. If true, print `1 1 ... 1`; otherwise, print `-1`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
