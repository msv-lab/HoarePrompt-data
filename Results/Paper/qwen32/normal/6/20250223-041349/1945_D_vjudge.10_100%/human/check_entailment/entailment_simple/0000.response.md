Reasoning: 

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in the queue. However, there are several issues with the code that indicate it will not function correctly.

1. **Incorrect Function Call and Variable Usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `pergunta` as the first argument, which is misleading because `pergunta` is not the correct variable to be passed. Instead, `pergunta` should be initialized to a large value (infinity) and then updated within the function to represent the minimum cost.
   - The variable `pergunta` is used as a parameter in the function `func_1`, but it is not used correctly. The function should return the minimum cost, not print it directly from within the function, as the print statement should be outside the function to match the problem's output requirements.

2. **Logic Error in the Function**:
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The function is supposed to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first m positions in the queue. However, the current implementation does not correctly account for the cost of bribing people and moving Kirill to his desired position.
   - The variable `x` is intended to accumulate the minimum cost of bribing people, but the logic for updating `pergunta` is incorrect. The value of `pergunta` is not being updated correctly to reflect the minimum cost to reach one of the first m positions.

3. **Initialization and Output**:
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to infinity, which is correct for finding the minimum value. However, its value is not being updated correctly within the function.
   - The print statement inside the function will print the initial value of `pergunta` before any updates, which is not the correct output.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
