Reasoning:  
The provided code snippet contains a logical error in the function `func_1`. The variable `pergunta` is supposed to hold the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. However, the way `pergunta` is being updated and used is incorrect.

1. The initial value of `pergunta` is set to `float('inf')`, which is correct. This ensures that any valid calculation will be less than this initial value.
2. The loop iterates from the end of the list to the beginning. This is correct as it allows Kirill to consider bribing people from the back of the queue to the front.
3. Inside the loop, `pergunta` is supposed to be updated with the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]` if `i < m`. However, `x` is not correctly calculated to reflect the cost of bribing people up to position `i`. Instead, `x` is the cumulative sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all positions from `0` to `n-1`, which is not the correct cost to bribe people up to position `i`.
4. The final print statement outputs `pergunta`, which should hold the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend, but due to the incorrect calculation of `x`, the output will be incorrect.

To fix the code, we need to correctly calculate the cost of bribing people up to position `i` and update `pergunta` accordingly. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        x += b[i]
    print(pergunta)
```

In this corrected version, `x` is the cumulative sum of `b[i]` for all positions from `i+1` to `n-1`, which correctly reflects the cost of bribing people up to position `i`.

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
