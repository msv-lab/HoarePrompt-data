#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a and b are lists of integers where each list contains n elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), each element in a and b is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), and m is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: `pergunta` is the minimum of its initial value and `x + a[i]` for `i < m`; `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each list contains `n` elements (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), each element in `a` and `b` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9); `m` is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n); `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `-1`.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the initial value of pergunta before any updates)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes two lists of integers `a` and `b` along with an integer `m` to compute a value based on the minimum of the initial `pergunta` and the sum of certain elements from `a` and `b`. It prints the final computed value of `pergunta` after processing.
