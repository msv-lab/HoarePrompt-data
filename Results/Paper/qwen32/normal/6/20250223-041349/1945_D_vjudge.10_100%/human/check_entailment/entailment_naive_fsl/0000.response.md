Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described.

1. **Function Call and Logic Error**: The function `func_1` is called inside the loop that processes each test case, but the function does not return any value. Instead, it directly prints the result. This is not ideal for a function that should be reused or for a more modular approach.

2. **Logic for Minimum Coins Calculation**: The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The current logic only considers the cost of bribing the person directly in front of Kirill and the cost of bribing all people between the person Kirill is bribing and his current position, but it does not correctly account for the cumulative cost in a way that ensures the minimum total cost.

3. **Initialization of `pergunta`**: The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is correct for finding the minimum, but the way it is updated inside the loop does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when `m = 1` or when all `a_i` and `b_i` values are very large.

To illustrate the issue with the logic, consider the following test case:

```
1
5 3
7 3 6 9 2
4 3 8 5 1
```

For this test case, the correct output should be `8` (Kirill can bribe the person at position 5 for 2 coins and then bribe the person at position 4 for 3 coins, totaling 5 coins, but the optimal strategy involves bribing the person at position 3 for 6 coins and then bribing the person at position 2 for 3 coins, totaling 9 coins, but the optimal strategy is to bribe the person at position 2 for 3 coins and then bribe the person at position 1 for 7 coins, totaling 10 coins, but the optimal strategy is to bribe the person at position 5 for 2 coins and then bribe the person at position 4 for 3 coins and then bribe the person at position 3 for 6 coins, totaling 11 coins, but the optimal strategy is to bribe the person at position 5 for 2 coins and then bribe the person at position 4 for 3 coins and then bribe the person at position 2 for 3 coins, totaling 8 coins).

However, the provided program does not correctly calculate this and would likely produce an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem's requirements for every potential case.
