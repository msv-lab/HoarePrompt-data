To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the given information step by step:

1. **Variable `a` and `b`**: Both are lists of integers with `n` elements each (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000`). Each element in `a` and `b` is an integer in the range `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Variable `x`**: It is calculated as the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`. Mathematically, `x = sum(min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n))`.

3. **Variable `m`**: It is an integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ n`.

4. **Variable `pergunta`**: Its initial value is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is updated to be the minimum of its initial value and `x + a[i]` for `i < m`. Since `i` is initially `-1`, the expression `x + a[i]` is not evaluated because `i` does not satisfy the condition `i < m` (as `-1` is not less than any positive integer `m`). Therefore, `pergunta` retains its initial value, which is not specified in the problem, but we can infer it must be a value that can be compared with `x + a[i]` for valid `i`.

5. **Variable `i`**: It is initialized to `-1`.

Given the above information, the `print(pergunta)` statement will print the value of `pergunta` as it stands after the initial state is set. Since the initial value of `pergunta` is not explicitly provided, we can only describe it as the value it holds before any updates. The update condition involving `i` does not apply because `i` is `-1`.

Output: **pergunta (where pergunta is the initial value of pergunta before any updates)**
