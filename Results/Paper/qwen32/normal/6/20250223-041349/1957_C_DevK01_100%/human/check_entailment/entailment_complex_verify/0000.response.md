### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. The player and the computer take turns placing rooks, and the computer mirrors the player's move unless the move is on the diagonal. The task is to determine the number of different final configurations of the board after \( k \) moves by the player and the corresponding computer moves.

#### Key Points:
1. **Move Reduction:**
   - If a move is not on the diagonal (i.e., \( a \neq b \)), both the player's and the computer's moves occupy two unique positions, reducing the available positions by 2.
   - If a move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( a = b \)), only one position is occupied, reducing the available positions by 1.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is supposed to compute the number of configurations for placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) board after reducing \( n \) based on the moves.
   - The formula used in `func_1` is `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (10**9 + 7)`, which seems to be an attempt to count the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks.

#### Code Analysis:
- The code correctly reduces \( n \) based on the moves.
- However, the dynamic programming formula in `func_1` does not correctly represent the number of configurations for placing non-attacking rooks.

#### Annotations:
- The annotated code shows that the state before the function call has \( t \) test cases, each with an \( n \times n \) board and \( k \) moves.
- The function `func_1` is called with the reduced \( n \) and returns a value that does not match the expected number of configurations.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the dynamic programming formula in `func_1` is incorrect and that the program does not handle all scenarios properly.

#### Counterexample:
- The provided counterexample demonstrates that the program does not correctly compute the number of configurations for a specific input.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly calculate the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after the given moves due to an incorrect dynamic programming formula and improper handling of edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
