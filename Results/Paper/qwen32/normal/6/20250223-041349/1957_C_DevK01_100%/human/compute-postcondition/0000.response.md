The code snippet provided initializes a list named `dp` with the values `[1, 1]`. The initial state includes the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, which are not modified by the given code snippet. The variables `r_i` and `c_i` are not relevant to the given code snippet as they are not used in it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `dp` is a list with values `[1, 1]`.**
