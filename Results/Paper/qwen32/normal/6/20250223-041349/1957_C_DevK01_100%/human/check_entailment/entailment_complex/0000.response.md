Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly compute the number of different final configurations for the described game scenario. The function `func_1(n)` seems to be an attempt at computing something related to the problem, but the logic inside it is not aligned with the problem requirements. The function appears to be computing some kind of dynamic programming sequence, but the sequence it computes does not correspond to the number of valid rook placements on the chessboard after k moves.

The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations of the chessboard, considering the constraints of rook placement and the mirroring rule. The function `func_1(n)` does not take into account the specific moves already made (r_i, c_i) and how they affect the remaining possible moves. Instead, it simply computes a sequence based on `n` without considering the state of the board after k moves.

Moreover, the function `func_1(n)` always returns the same value (39 in the provided state) regardless of the input `n`, which is clearly incorrect as the number of configurations should vary with `n` and the initial moves.

Correctness: **False**
