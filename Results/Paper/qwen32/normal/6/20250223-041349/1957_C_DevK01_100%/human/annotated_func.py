#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.
def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        
        dp.pop(0)
        
    #State: [9, 39]
    return dp[-1]
    #The program returns 39.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the result of a specific computation that, for the provided test cases, always results in the integer 39.
