Let's analyze the problem, the provided program, and the given function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. Players alternate turns, with the computer mirroring the player's moves unless the move is on the main diagonal. The goal is to calculate the number of different final configurations after \( k \) moves, where each move is guaranteed to be valid.

### Program Analysis

Here's a breakdown of the provided program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (size of the chessboard) and \( k \) (number of moves already played).
   - For each of the \( k \) moves, it reads the coordinates \( (r, c) \).

2. **Reduction of \( n \):**
   - If a move is not on the main diagonal (\( a \neq b \)), it reduces \( n \) by 2 because both the player and the computer place rooks.
   - If a move is on the main diagonal (\( a == b \)), it reduces \( n \) by 1 because the computer skips its turn.

3. **Calculation of Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the reduced \( n \).
   - `func_1` uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of configurations.

### Function Summary Evaluation

The function summary states that `func_1` returns the integer 39 for the provided test cases. However, this is not consistent with the problem's requirements. The function should compute the number of ways to place rooks on a reduced chessboard, which is not necessarily 39.

### Correctness Evaluation

Let's challenge the original assessment by examining the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Reduction of \( n \):**
   - The logic for reducing \( n \) seems correct for the given problem. If a move is not on the main diagonal, both the player and the computer place rooks, reducing \( n \) by 2. If a move is on the main diagonal, the computer skips its turn, reducing \( n \) by 1.

2. **Dynamic Programming in `func_1`:**
   - The dynamic programming formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)` is not clearly explained in the problem or the function summary. This formula does not match the problem's requirements for calculating the number of configurations.
   - The function is supposed to compute the number of ways to place rooks on a reduced \( n \times n \) board, which is a combinatorial problem. The formula used does not align with the combinatorial nature of the problem.

### Counterexample

Let's consider the provided counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
1 2
3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- After the first move (1, 2), the computer places a black rook at (2, 1).
- After the second move (3, 4), the computer places a black rook at (4, 3).
- The only remaining valid move is placing a rook at (2, 3) and (3, 2), which results in the same configuration.

**Actual Output:**
The program might not correctly compute this and could output an incorrect number of configurations.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly calculate the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after the given moves. The function `func_1` does not use an appropriate formula to compute the number of configurations, and the reduction of \( n \) is not sufficient to ensure the correct result.

**Final: False**
