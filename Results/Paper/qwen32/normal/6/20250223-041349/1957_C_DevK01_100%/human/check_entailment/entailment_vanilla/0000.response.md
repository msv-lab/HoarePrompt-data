### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an `n x n` chessboard.
   - Players take turns placing rooks (white and black) such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - After `k` moves, we need to determine the number of possible final configurations.
   - The computer mirrors the player's move unless the move is on the diagonal (`r == c`), in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - The final configurations are counted modulo `10^9+7`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each move places a white rook at `(r, c)` and a black rook at `(c, r)` unless `r == c`.
   - If a rook is placed on the diagonal, only one rook is placed, and the computer skips its turn.
   - The number of available positions reduces by 2 for each non-diagonal move and by 1 for each diagonal move.
   - The problem reduces to counting the number of ways to place the remaining rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of ways to place `n` non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` board.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place `i` non-attacking rooks.
   - This recurrence relation is derived from considering the placement of the first rook and the remaining placements.
   - The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then processes each of the `k` moves, adjusting `n` based on whether the move is diagonal or not.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations and prints the result modulo `10^9+7`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for adjusting `n` based on the moves is correct.
   - The dynamic programming function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the number of ways to place `n` non-attacking rooks.
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
