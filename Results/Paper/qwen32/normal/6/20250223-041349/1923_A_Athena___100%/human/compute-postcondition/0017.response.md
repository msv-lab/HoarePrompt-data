The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the list `a` ends with `0`, the last element that will be removed is `0`. Therefore, the list `a` will no longer contain the `0` at the end after the `pop` operation. The variables `t`, `n`, and `res` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers that does not end with `0`; `res` is 0.**
