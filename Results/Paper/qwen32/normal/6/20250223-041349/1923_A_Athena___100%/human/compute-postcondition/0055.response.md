Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 999; `n` is the integer value of the input; `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element; `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is set to 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
