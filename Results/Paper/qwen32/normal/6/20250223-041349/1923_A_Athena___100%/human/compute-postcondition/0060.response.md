To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved.

1. **`t`**: This variable represents the number of test cases and is in the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 999. However, `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output of `print(res)`.

2. **`n`**: This variable is the integer value of the input. The exact value of `n` is not given, but it is used to form the list `a`.

3. **`a`**: This is a list derived from `n` with all trailing zeros removed. For example, if `n` is 10200, then `a` would be `[1, 0, 2]`.

4. **`res`**: This variable is the count of zeros in the list `a`. Given that `a` has all trailing zeros removed, `res` will count any zeros that are not trailing in the original number `n`.

Let's consider a few examples to understand `res` better:

- If `n` is `10200`, then `a` becomes `[1, 0, 2]` and `res` is `1` (since there is one zero in the list `a`).
- If `n` is `1000`, then `a` becomes `[1]` and `res` is `0` (since there are no zeros in the list `a`).
- If `n` is `100200`, then `a` becomes `[1, 0, 0, 2]` and `res` is `2` (since there are two zeros in the list `a`).

In general, `res` will be the count of non-trailing zeros in the list `a` formed from `n`.

Given this understanding, the output of `print(res)` will be the count of non-trailing zeros in the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of non-trailing zeros in the list `a` formed from `n`)**
