To determine what will be printed when the `print(res)` statement is executed, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers that does not end with 0.
- `res` is the total count of zeros in the list `a`.

From the initial state, we know that `res` is calculated as the total count of zeros in the list `a`. However, the exact content of the list `a` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `res`. We only know that `res` is derived from counting the zeros in the list `a`.

Thus, the output of the `print(res)` statement will be the total count of zeros in the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the total count of zeros in the list `a`)**
