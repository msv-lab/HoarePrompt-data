The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations. The loop will execute `t` times, and since `_` is not used within the loop body, it does not affect the state of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `res`. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 each time the loop completes an iteration.

Given that the loop has just finished an iteration, we need to adjust `t` to reflect that one iteration has been completed. Therefore, `t` should be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 999; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers that does not end with 0; `res` is the total count of zeros in the list `a`.**
