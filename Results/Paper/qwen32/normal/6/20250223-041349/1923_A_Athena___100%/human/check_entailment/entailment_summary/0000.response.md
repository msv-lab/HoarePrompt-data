### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior based on the problem description and the execution summary.

The task is to find the minimum number of operations needed to move chips so that they form a single contiguous block without any free cells between them. The program's logic seems to be focused on counting the number of free cells within the span of the first and last chip in the list.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
2. **Trimming Free Cells**: It first removes any leading and trailing free cells (0s) from the list `a` by using `pop(0)` and `pop()` methods. This step ensures that the list `a` now starts and ends with a chip (1).
3. **Counting Free Cells**: It then iterates through the trimmed list and counts the number of free cells (0s) within this range. This count is stored in the variable `res`.
4. **Output**: For each test case, it prints the count of free cells `res`, which represents the number of operations needed to move chips to form a single block.

This logic correctly identifies the number of operations required because each free cell between chips needs to be filled by moving a chip from the right, which corresponds to the number of free cells within the span of the first and last chip.

### Validation with Example:

Let's verify the program logic with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - Trimmed List: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
  - Free Cells Count: `1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - Trimmed List: `1`
  - Free Cells Count: `0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Trimmed List: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Free Cells Count: `0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Trimmed List: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Free Cells Count: `2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**:
  - Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - Trimmed List: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
  - Free Cells Count: `3`
  - Output: `3` (Correct)

The program logic aligns perfectly with the problem requirements and correctly calculates the number of operations needed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
