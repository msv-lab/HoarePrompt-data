The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input. The values of `t`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be in the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 999; `n` is the integer value of the input; `a` is a list of integers that does not end with 0; `res` is the total count of zeros in the list `a`.**
