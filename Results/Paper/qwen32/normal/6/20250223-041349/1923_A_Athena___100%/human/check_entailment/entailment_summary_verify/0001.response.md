Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic to ensure it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to move chips in such a way that they form a single contiguous block, minimizing the number of operations. Each operation involves moving a chip to the closest free cell to its left.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells.

2. **Initial Trimming:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()`. This step is correct because leading and trailing free cells do not affect the minimum number of moves needed to form a contiguous block of chips.

3. **Counting Moves:**
   - The program iterates through the trimmed list `a`. For each zero encountered, it increments the result `res` by 1. This step assumes that each zero represents a free cell that needs to be filled by a chip from the right.

### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of cells where each cell is either free (0) or contains a chip (1). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of free cells between the first and last cell that contains a chip.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Initial Trimming:** This step correctly trims the unnecessary free cells from the start and end of the ribbon, as they do not affect the minimum number of moves required.
- **Counting Moves:** The logic of counting zeros in the trimmed list is correct because each zero represents a gap that needs to be filled by a chip from the right, and each such gap requires exactly one move to fill.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example.

**First Test Case:**
- Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
- After trimming: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
- Number of zeros: `1`
- Output: `1` (Correct)

**Second Test Case:**
- Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
- After trimming: `1`
- Number of zeros: `0`
- Output: `0` (Correct)

**Third Test Case:**
- Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
- After trimming: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
- Number of zeros: `0`
- Output: `0` (Correct)

**Fourth Test Case:**
- Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
- After trimming: `1 0 1 0 1`
- Number of zeros: `2`
- Output: `2` (Correct)

**Fifth Test Case:**
- Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
- After trimming: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
- Number of zeros: `3`
- Output: `3` (Correct)

### Detailed Reasoning:
The program correctly trims the leading and trailing zeros and then counts the number of zeros in the remaining list. Each zero in the trimmed list represents a gap that needs to be filled by moving a chip from the right, which requires exactly one move. Therefore, the number of zeros in the trimmed list is indeed the minimum number of operations required to form a contiguous block of chips.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the minimum number of operations required to form a contiguous block of chips for each test case.

**Final Evaluation:**
Final: **True**
