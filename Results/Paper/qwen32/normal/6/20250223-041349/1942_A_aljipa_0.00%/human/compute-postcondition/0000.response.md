The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means that the value of `t`, which was initially described as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, is now set to the specific integer value provided by the input. The other variables (`n` and `k`) and their conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^3. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.**
