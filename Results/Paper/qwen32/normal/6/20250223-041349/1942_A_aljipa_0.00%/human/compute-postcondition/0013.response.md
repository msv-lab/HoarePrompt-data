Output State: **`t` is 0; no more test cases are processed; the final `res` is determined by the last test case processed, which is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing `-1` otherwise.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process. The final `res` will be the result of the last test case: a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing `-1` otherwise.
