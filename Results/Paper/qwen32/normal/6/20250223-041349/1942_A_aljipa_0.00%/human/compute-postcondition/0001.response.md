To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variable in the loop head, which is `_` in this case, but the controlling variable is `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The other variables `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust them to ensure the loop executes.

Given the state before the loop starts is `t` is the input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3, we need to ensure `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The values of `n` and `k` do not affect the execution of the outer loop.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3**
