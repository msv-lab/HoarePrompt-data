The code snippet reassigns the values of `n` and `k` based on the input. The initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the integers read from the input. The values of `t`, and the initial conditions for `res` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3 - 1\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing `-1` otherwise.**
