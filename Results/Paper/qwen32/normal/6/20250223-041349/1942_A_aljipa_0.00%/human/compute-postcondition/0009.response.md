The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times (`t` times). The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of each iteration, the loop variable `_` is implicitly incremented, but since it is a throwaway variable, its value is not directly relevant to the loop's continuation.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^3 - 1\). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `t` will be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this decrement.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3 - 1\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing `-1` otherwise.**
