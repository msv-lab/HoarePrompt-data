Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sorted Array Definition**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shift**: A cyclic shift of an array involves moving elements from the beginning of the array to the end.
3. **Objective**: For a given `n` and `k`, find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= n <= 1000`
   - `1 <= k <= n`
   - `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`

### Solution Strategy:
- **k = n**: If all cyclic shifts need to be sorted, the array must be sorted itself. An array with all elements the same (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]`) satisfies this condition.
- **k = 1**: If only one cyclic shift needs to be sorted, we can create an array where only one shift is sorted, and the rest are not. For example, `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` has only the first shift sorted.
- **k > 1 and k < n**: The provided solution does not handle this case. It incorrectly returns `[-1]` for these cases, which might not be the only or correct solution.

### Program Analysis:
- **k == n**: The program correctly returns an array of `n` ones, which is sorted and all its cyclic shifts are sorted.
- **k == 1**: The program correctly returns an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, which has only the first cyclic shift sorted.
- **k > 1 and k < n**: The program incorrectly returns `[-1]`, which is not always the correct solution. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, there are valid arrays like `[1, 2, 1]` that have exactly two sorted cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where `1 < k < n` correctly. It should provide a valid array for these cases, but it returns `-1` instead. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
