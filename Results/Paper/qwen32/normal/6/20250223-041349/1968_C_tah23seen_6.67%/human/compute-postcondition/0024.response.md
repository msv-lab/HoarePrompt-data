The code snippet provided updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. Given the initial state, `ans[i + 1]` was previously calculated to be the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + k * ans[i]` for some integer `k`. 

Now, the new value of `ans[i + 1]` is directly set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, which might or might not be greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. 

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + ans[i]`. `i` is `i + 1`.**
