To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

The state right before the loop is as follows:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500.
- The length of `arr` is `n-1`.
- `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is now `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

Given the loop condition `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`, we need to ensure that `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` for the loop to execute.

To make sure the loop executes, we need to adjust the values of `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]` such that the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` holds true. Since `i` is `i + 1` right before the loop, we should consider the initial values of `ans` and `arr` for the first iteration.

Let's break it down:
- `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, so `ans[0]` is always greater than `arr[0]`.
- For `i = 0`, we need `ans[1] <= arr[1]`.

Given that `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`, and `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, we have:
- `ans[1] = arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1) = 2 * arr[0] + 1`.

To ensure `ans[1] <= arr[1]` holds true, we need:
- `2 * arr[0] + 1 <= arr[1]`.

Since `arr[0]` and `arr[1]` are integers between 1 and 500, we need to adjust `arr[1]` to be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.

Let's summarize the adjustments:
- `arr[1]` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted because the condition only involves `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`.
