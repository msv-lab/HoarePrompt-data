Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the resulting array a_1, ..., a_n such that 2 <= n <= 500, the length of `arr` is n-1, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.**

In simple terms: The list `arr` remains unchanged. The integer `n` representing the number of elements in the resulting array remains unchanged. The length of `arr` remains `n-1`. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged. The list `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, but the first element `ans[0]` is now `arr[0] + 1`.
