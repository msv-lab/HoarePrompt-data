Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, the length of `arr` is `n-1`, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` for i in the range from 0 to `n-2`. The current value of `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`
Code of the loop:
while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
    ans[i + 1] += ans[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, the length of `arr` is `n-1`, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` for i in the range from 0 to `n-2`. The current value of `ans[i + 1]` is now `arr[i] + 2 * ans[i]` for i in the range from 0 to `n-2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, the length of `arr` is `n-1`, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `arr[i] + ans[i]` for i in the range from 0 to `n-2`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500; the length of `arr` is `n-1`; `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `arr[i] + ans[i]` for i in the range from 0 to `n-2`, and `ans[i + 1]` has been updated to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`; `arr[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to the updated `ans[i + 1]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
