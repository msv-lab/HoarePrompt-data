### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to construct an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that for each `i` from `2` to `n`, `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`, where `x_i` is given. The program does this through the `func_1` function, which generates the `a` array based on the `x` array.

Let's break down the steps in the `func_1` function to see if it correctly constructs the desired array:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = x_2` (which is `arr[0]`) holds true because `ans[0] + 1` is the smallest number greater than `arr[0]` that can be used to ensure `a_2 = arr[0] + k * ans[0]` for some `k`, and in this case, `k=1` makes `a_2 % ans[0] = arr[0]`.

2. **Loop for Elements from `a_2` to `a_{n-1}`**:
   - For each `i` from `1` to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is set to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}` holds true because `ans[i]` is the smallest number greater than `arr[i-1]` that can be used to ensure `a_{i+1} = arr[i-1] + k * ans[i]` for some `k`, and in this case, `k=1` makes `a_{i+1} % ans[i] = arr[i-1]`.
   - If `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`, it enters a `while` loop to increment `ans[i]` by `ans[i-1]` until `ans[i]` is greater than `arr[i]`. This is to ensure that `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}` holds true, as `a_{i+1} = arr[i] + k * ans[i]` for some `k`.

3. **Final Element**:
   - `ans[-1]` (which is `a_n`) is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n` holds true because `a_n = arr[n-1] + k * ans[n-1]` for some `k`, and in this case, `k=1` makes `a_n % ans[n-1] = arr[n-1]`.

The program ensures that all conditions are met by carefully constructing each element of the `a` array based on the given `x` array and the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
