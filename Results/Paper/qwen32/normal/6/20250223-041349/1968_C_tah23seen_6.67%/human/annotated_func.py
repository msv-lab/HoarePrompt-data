#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer representing the number of elements in the resulting array a_1, ..., a_n such that 2 <= n <= 500. The length of arr is n-1. There are t test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i-1] + k * ans[i-1]` for some positive integer `k`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` where `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `1` to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i-1] + k * ans[i-1]` for some positive integer `k`; `ans[n-1] = ans[n-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element `ans[0]` is one more than the first element of `arr`. Each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i <= n-2`) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i-1] + k * ans[i-1]` for some positive integer `k`. The last element `ans[n-1]` is the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.
