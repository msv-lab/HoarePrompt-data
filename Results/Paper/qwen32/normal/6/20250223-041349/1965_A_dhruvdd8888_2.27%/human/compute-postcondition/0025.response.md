To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and the conditions under which it continues or breaks.

The loop iterates through the `nums` list, checking if the difference between consecutive elements is 1. If it is, `cd` is incremented. If not, the loop breaks. The loop will continue to iterate as long as the difference between consecutive elements is 1.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the first three consecutive elements in `nums` have a difference of 1. The loop will continue to iterate until it encounters a pair of consecutive elements where the difference is not 1 or it reaches the end of the list.

Let's denote the length of `nums` as `len(nums)`. The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = len(nums) - 3` (since it checks `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i + 2]`).

The final output state will be determined by the point at which the loop breaks or the end of the list is reached.

### Output State Analysis
- If the loop iterates until the end of the list without breaking (i.e., all consecutive elements have a difference of 1), `cd` will be equal to `len(nums) - 2`.
- If the loop breaks at some point, `cd` will be equal to the number of consecutive elements with a difference of 1 before the break.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `nums`, we can only describe the final state in a general form.

### Final Output State
The final value of `cd` will be the number of consecutive elements in `nums` starting from the second element (index 1) that have a difference of 1.

Output State: **`cd` is the number of consecutive elements in `nums` starting from the second element that have a difference of 1.**

In natural language, the final output state is that `cd` will be the count of consecutive elements in the `nums` list (starting from the second element) where each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous one, until a different difference is encountered or the end of the list is reached.
