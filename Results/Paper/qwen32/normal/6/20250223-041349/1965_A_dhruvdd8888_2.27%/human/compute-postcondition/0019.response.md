The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the variables `N`, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
