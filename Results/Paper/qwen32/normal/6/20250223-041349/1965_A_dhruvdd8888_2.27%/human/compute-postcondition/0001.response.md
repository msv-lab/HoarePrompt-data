The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts that list into a set called `nums`. The variables `N`, `t`, `n`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. The set `nums` will contain unique elements from the input line.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case, `nums` is a set of unique strings from the input line.**
