The code snippet provided is:

```python
a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
```

This line of code updates the list `a` by mapping the elements from `data[index:index + n]` to integers. Given the initial state, `a` was already defined as a list of `n` integers. After executing this line, `a` will be reassigned to a new list of integers derived from the slice of `data` starting at `index` and ending at `index + n`.

The other variables (`data`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `input`, `index`, `t`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`; `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, specifically `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, specifically `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is `9 + 4*n + 4 + n`; `t` is greater than 0; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the second being the value of `result`.**
