Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns, `PB` and `PS` are integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of n integers representing the array. `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function.**

Explanation: The `input().split()` function reads the entire input as a string and then splits it into a list of substrings wherever there are spaces. The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are still in their initial state but are now represented as strings within the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
