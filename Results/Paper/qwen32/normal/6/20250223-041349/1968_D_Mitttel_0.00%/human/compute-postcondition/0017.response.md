Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, specifically `p = list(map(int, data[5:5 + n]))`; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, specifically `a = list(map(int, data[5 + n:5 + 2*n]))`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is `5 + 2*n`; `t` is a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.**

In natural language: The `results` list now contains one element, which is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
