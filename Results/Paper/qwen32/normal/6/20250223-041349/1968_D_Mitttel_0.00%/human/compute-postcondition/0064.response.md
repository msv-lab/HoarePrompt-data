The code snippet `current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]` updates the value of `current_pos` based on the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `current_pos`, which is now set to `p[current_pos - 1]`.

Output State: **`cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `start_pos` remains unchanged, `score` is the total of the values from the array `a` at the positions visited in the first `k` steps plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` is equal to `k`, `visited` dictionary contains all positions visited in the first `k` steps with their respective step numbers, `cycle_length` is `k - cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for all positions visited in the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps in the permutation starting from the initial `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps` is greater than 0 and is now `remainder_steps - 1`, `full_cycles` is 0, `remainder_steps` is greater than 0**.
