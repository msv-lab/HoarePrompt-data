Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is 5; `t` is a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 4, so it changes from 1 to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
