Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with these parameters and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.**
