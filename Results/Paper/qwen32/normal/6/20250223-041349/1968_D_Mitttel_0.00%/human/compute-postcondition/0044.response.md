To determine what will be printed when the `print(result)` statement is executed, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and how the variables are defined and used.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **`data`**: A list of strings.
2. **`n`**: The integer value of `data[index]`.
3. **`k`**: The integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
4. **`PB`**: The integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
5. **`PS`**: The integer value of `data[index + 3]`.
6. **`p`**: A list of `n` integers representing a permutation.
7. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers representing an array.
8. **`input`**: Assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function.
9. **`index`**: The final value after all iterations of the loop.
10. **`t`**: Initialized to 0.
11. **`results`**: A list containing at least one value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
12. **`result`**: The value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` from the last iteration.

### Key Points:

- The value of `result` is the output of the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` from the last iteration of the loop.
- The exact value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` at the time of the last iteration.

### Output Description:

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` and the values of its parameters (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`) are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the function's return value.

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` from the last iteration)**
