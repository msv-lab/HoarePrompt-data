The code snippet provided calls the function `func_1` with parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. The return value of this function is assigned to the variable `result`. The other variables (`data`, `input`, `index`, `t`, and `results`) are not affected by the function call.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, specifically `p = list(map(int, data[5:5 + n]))`; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, specifically `a = list(map(int, data[5 + n:5 + 2*n]))`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is `5 + 2*n`; `t` is a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.**
