The code snippet `k = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `k` to be the integer value of the element at position `index + 1` in the `data` list. The initial value of `index` is 1, so `k` will be updated to the integer value of `data[2]`.

Given the initial state, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `PB` and `PS` are integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is 1; `t` is a positive integer greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**
