The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array.
- `k`: a positive integer representing the number of turns.
- `PB`: an integer representing the starting position of Bodya, such that 1 <= PB <= n.
- `PS`: an integer representing the starting position of Sasha, such that 1 <= PS <= n.
- `p`: a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, where each element in `p` is a positive integer and 1 <= p[i] <= n for all 1 <= i <= n.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers representing the array, where each element in `a` is a positive integer and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n.

The function returns:
- Case_1: The result of the game after `k` turns, which could be the position of the winner or a specific value indicating the outcome based on the rules defined by the permutation and array.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`, and returns the result of the game after `k` turns based on the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.**
