The code snippet provided updates the value of `k` by reading a new value from the `data` list at the position `index + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`; `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, specifically `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, specifically `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `index` is `5 + 4*n + 4`; `t` is greater than 0; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the second being the value of `result`.**
