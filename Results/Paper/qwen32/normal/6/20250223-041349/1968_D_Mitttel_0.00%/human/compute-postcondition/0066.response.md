Postcondition: **`start_pos` remains unchanged. `score` is the total of the values from the array `a` at the positions visited in the first `k` steps. If `cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `score` is further adjusted by adding `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for the `remainder_steps` iterations. `current_pos` is the position after `k` steps in the permutation, and if `cycle_start` is not equal to -1, it is specifically the position after `remainder_steps` iterations in the permutation starting from the position after `k` steps. `steps` is equal to `k`. `visited` dictionary contains all positions visited in the first `k` steps with their respective step numbers. `cycle_start` remains -1 if no cycle was detected, otherwise, `cycle_length` is `k - cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for all positions visited in the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps in the permutation starting from the initial `cycle_pos`, and `remaining_steps` and `full_cycles` are calculated accordingly.**
