The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` of the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is `[0, 0]`, so the value at index `c` will be incremented. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `ans` are not affected by this code snippet.

Since the value of `c` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine which index of `cnt` will be incremented. However, we can express the output state in terms of `c`.

If `c` is 0, `cnt` will become `[1, 0]`.
If `c` is 1, `cnt` will become `[0, 1]`.

Given the lack of a specific value for `c`, we can describe the output state as:

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `s` is a non-empty list of integers, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is `[0, 0]` with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `ans` is 0.**
