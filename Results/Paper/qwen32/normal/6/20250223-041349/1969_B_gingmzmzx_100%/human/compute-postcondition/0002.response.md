The code reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and then maps each character of the input string to an integer, converting the result into a list. This list is assigned to the variable `s`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string**.
