Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is `t - 1`, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]`, `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**

Natural language description: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding the result of `zeroes - cnt[0]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state descriptions.
