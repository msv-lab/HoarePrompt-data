The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the element `c` in the list `cnt`. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s`, we need to update the `cnt` list accordingly. If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` will be incremented by 1. If `c` is not 0, `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1.

Let's break it down:
- If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1.
- If `c` is not 0, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `ans` remain unchanged by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is `t - 1`, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated such that if `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `c` is 0 and `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `c` is not 0, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
