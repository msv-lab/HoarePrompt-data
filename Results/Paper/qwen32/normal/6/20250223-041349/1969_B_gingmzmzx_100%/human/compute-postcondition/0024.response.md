To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **t**: At least 1 (though its exact value is not critical for determining `ans`).
2. **n**: Assigned the value of `t`, so `n` is also at least 1.
3. **s**: A non-empty list of integers.
4. **zeroes**: The count of zeroes in the list `s`.
5. **cnt**: A list where `cnt[0]` is the total number of 0s in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the total number of 1s in `s`.
6. **ans**: Calculated based on the following rules:
   - Add `1` for each `0` encountered after at least one `1`.
   - Add `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each `1` encountered.

Let's derive the value of `ans` step by step:

1. **Counting Zeros and Ones**:
   - `zeroes` is the total number of `0`s in `s`.
   - `cnt[0]` is also the total number of `0`s in `s`.
   - `cnt[1]` is the total number of `1`s in `s`.

2. **Calculating `ans`**:
   - The first part of `ans` is the count of `0`s that appear after at least one `1`. Let's denote this count as `post_ones_zeroes`.
   - The second part of `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`. Since `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` are the same, this part evaluates to `0`.

Thus, `ans` simplifies to the count of `0`s that appear after at least one `1`.

To summarize:
- `ans` is the number of `0`s in `s` that come after at least one `1`.

Given the format required, the output will be described in terms of the list `s`:

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of 0s in s that come after at least one 1)**
