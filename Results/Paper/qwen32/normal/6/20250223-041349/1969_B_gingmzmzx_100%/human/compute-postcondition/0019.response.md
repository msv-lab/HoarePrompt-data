The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` of the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is either `[2, 0]` or `[0, 1]` depending on whether `c` is `0` or not. After the increment, if `c` is `0`, `cnt` becomes `[3, 0]`. If `c` is `1`, `cnt` becomes `[0, 2]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `s` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one more element after the current `c`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[0, 2]`, and `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
