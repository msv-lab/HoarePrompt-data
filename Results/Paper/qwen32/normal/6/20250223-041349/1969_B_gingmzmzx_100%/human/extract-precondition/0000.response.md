Precondition: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a binary string s (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}) that needs to be sorted. The sum of the lengths of all strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
