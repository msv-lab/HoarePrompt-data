The provided code snippet is `cnt[c] += 1`. This line increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `c`, we can only describe the change in terms of `c`.

Given that `cnt` is initially `[0, 0]`, after executing `cnt[c] += 1`, the value at index `c` in `cnt` will be incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `s` is a list of integers based on the input and must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[0, 0]` except `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is 0.**
