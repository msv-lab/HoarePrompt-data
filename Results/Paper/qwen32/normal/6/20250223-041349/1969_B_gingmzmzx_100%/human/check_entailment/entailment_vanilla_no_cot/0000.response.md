Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic in the code does not properly account for the cost of performing the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string. The code seems to be attempting to count the number of inversions or transitions between 0s and 1s, but it does not accurately compute the cost of the operations required to sort the string.

To correctly solve the problem, a more appropriate approach would involve identifying the segments of the string that need to be cyclically shifted and calculating the cost of those shifts. The current implementation does not address this requirement accurately.
