Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always produce a correct solution based on the problem description. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to find a set of bets that meet the criteria, but it does not guarantee that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.

Let's analyze the logic in detail:

1. **func_1(a, b):** This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`. This is correct for finding the LCM.

2. **func_2():** This function reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `vals`. It then calculates the LCM of all the multipliers and stores it in `den`. The array `vprod` is created by dividing `den` by each multiplier, effectively finding the smallest set of integers that have the LCM of `den`.

3. **Adjustment Attempt:** The code then subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. If the result is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`, indicating no suitable distribution is possible. Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod` as the bets.

However, the approach has a few issues:
- The values in `vprod` are not necessarily the smallest possible bets that satisfy the condition. They are simply the smallest set of integers with the LCM of `den`.
- The check `den - sum(vprod) > 0` does not guarantee that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. It only ensures that the sum of the bets is less than the LCM of the multipliers, which is not sufficient to guarantee the condition for all winning outcomes.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
6 3 2
```
The LCM of `6`, `3`, and `2` is `6`. The `vprod` array will be `[1, 2, 3]` (since `6 // 6 = 1`, `6 // 3 = 2`, `6 // 2 = 3`). The sum of `vprod` is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, and `den - sum(vprod) = 6 - 6 = 0`, which is not greater than `0`, so the program will output `-1`. However, a valid solution exists, such as `[1, 1, 1]`, where the sum of the bets is `3`, and the amount received for each winning outcome is `6`, `3`, and `2` respectively, which are all strictly greater than `3`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
