Output State: **`N` is the integer value provided by the input (1 <= N <= 50); `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive and must have at least one more element; `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)` from the current iteration; `x` is the next element in `vals`.**

Explanation: The value of `den` has been updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)`. The values of `N`, `vals`, and `x` remain unchanged.
