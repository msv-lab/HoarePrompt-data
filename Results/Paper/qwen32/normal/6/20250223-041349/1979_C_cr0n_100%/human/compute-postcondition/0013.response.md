The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1` directly. The value to be printed is explicitly specified as `-1` and does not depend on any of the variables `N`, `vals`, `den`, or `vprod`.

Here is the breakdown of the provided initial state and the code:
- `N` is an integer input between 1 and 50.
- `vals` is a list of integers, each between 2 and 20.
- `den` is computed based on the application of `func_1` to elements of `vals` and the sum of `vprod`.
- `vprod` is a list of integers, each computed as `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
- The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

Despite the detailed description of how `den` and `vprod` are calculated, the `print` statement does not utilize these variables. It simply outputs `-1`.

Output: **-1**
