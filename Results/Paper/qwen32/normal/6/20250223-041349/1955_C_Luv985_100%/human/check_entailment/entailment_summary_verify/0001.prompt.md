You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of elements in the list `a` that can be fully consumed by repeatedly subtracting pairs of elements from `k` until `k` is exhausted or no more valid pairs can be found. An element is considered fully consumed if its value is reduced to zero.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided solution step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - We have `n` ships with given durability.
   - The Kraken attacks ships in a specific order: first, last, first, last, and so on.
   - Each attack reduces the durability of the attacked ship by 1.
   - A ship sinks when its durability drops to 0 and is no longer attacked.
   - The process continues until either all ships have sunk or the Kraken has performed `k` attacks.

2. **Approach**:
   - We maintain two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to represent the first and last ships that haven't sunk yet.
   - In each iteration, we determine the minimum durability between the ships at these two pointers (`mi = min(a[l], a[r])`).
   - We then consider two scenarios:
     - **Scenario 1**: If the Kraken can fully deplete the durability of both ships (`mi * 2 <= k`), it attacks both ships, reducing their durability by `mi` and decrementing `k` by `mi * 2`. If a ship's durability reaches 0, it is considered sunk, and we move the respective pointer inward.
     - **Scenario 2**: If the Kraken cannot fully deplete the durability of both ships (`mi * 2 > k`), we need to handle the remaining attacks (`k`). We calculate the remaining attacks and determine if the first ship will sink with these remaining attacks. If it does, we increment the count of sunk ships (`ans`).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `l == r`, it means there's only one ship left. We check if the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to sink this ship.
   - If all ships have sunk (`l > r`), we stop the process.

### Code Review:

- **Input Handling**:
  - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`T`) and processes each test case separately.
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` (number of ships and attacks), and the list of ship durabilities (`a`).

- **Logic Implementation**:
  - The logic to handle the attacks in an alternating pattern (first, last, first, last) is correctly implemented using the two pointers (`l` and `r`).
  - The logic to decrement the durability of ships and update the count of sunk ships (`ans`) is correct.
  - The handling of the edge case where `l == r` (only one ship left) is also correctly implemented.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The code correctly handles scenarios where all ships are sunk before `k` attacks are completed.
  - It also correctly handles scenarios where `k` attacks are sufficient to sink all ships.

### Conclusion:

After carefully reviewing the provided code and the problem description, it appears that the solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
