Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is an integer (converted from the first part of the input split by space), `k` is the second part of the input split by space converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a` to integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are reduced by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `ans` is 0 unless `a[n - 1]` (which was `a[r]` before the decrement) is 0, in which case `r` is set to `n - 2` and `ans` is set to 2. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of the updated `a[0]` and `a[r]`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is set to 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `l` remains 0. If `a[r]` is 0, then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is either 0 or 1, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` must be at least `l + 1`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, and if `a[l]` or `a[r]` becomes 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `l` or `r` is adjusted accordingly. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1 and the loop or statement is broken out of.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
