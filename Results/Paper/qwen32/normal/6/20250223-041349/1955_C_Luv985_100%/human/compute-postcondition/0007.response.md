The code snippet `a = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` was originally a list of `n` integers. After this operation, `a` is now a list of strings, each representing an integer that was input by the user.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input (and is explicitly of type int), `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of `n` strings, each representing an integer input by the user.**
