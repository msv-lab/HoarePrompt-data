Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 or `t` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` has been adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, and `a[r]` has been adjusted by subtracting `mi`. If `a[r] == 0`, then `r` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the adjustment. If `a[l] == 0`, then `l` is set to 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `l` remains 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the `if` statement execution, taking into account the adjustments made to `r` and `ans` when `a[r]` equals 0.
