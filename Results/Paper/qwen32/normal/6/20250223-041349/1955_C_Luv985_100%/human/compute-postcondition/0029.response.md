Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`. Additionally, `a[l] - t - k // 2` is equal to 0.**

The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
