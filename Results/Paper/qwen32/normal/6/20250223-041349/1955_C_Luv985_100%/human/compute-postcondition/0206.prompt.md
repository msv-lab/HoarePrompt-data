Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T-1`, `t` (possibly modified), `n`, `k` (0 or positive), `a` (with some elements potentially 0), `l` (first non-zero index), `r` (last non-zero index), `ans` (count of fully consumed elements). If `l == r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k >= a[l]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: T is greater than 0 but now T - number_of_iterations, t is modified, n is unchanged, k is 0 or less, a is modified, l is adjusted to be >= r, r is adjusted to be <= l, and ans reflects the number of elements set to zero incremented by 1 if k >= a[l] is True and l equals r.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` remains unchanged, `t` is modified, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is reduced, `a` has elements reduced, `l` and `r` are adjusted such that `l == r`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k >= a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
