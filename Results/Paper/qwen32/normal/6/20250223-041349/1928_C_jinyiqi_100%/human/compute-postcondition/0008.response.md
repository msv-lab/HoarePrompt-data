The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `output1`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, and `output1` has `i` appended to it.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, `output1` has `i` appended to it.**
