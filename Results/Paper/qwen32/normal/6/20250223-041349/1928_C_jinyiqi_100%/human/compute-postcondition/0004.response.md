The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `output1`. The values of `x`, `n`, and `output2` remain unchanged. The precondition that `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`) still holds.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing `i`; `output2` is an empty list; `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).**
