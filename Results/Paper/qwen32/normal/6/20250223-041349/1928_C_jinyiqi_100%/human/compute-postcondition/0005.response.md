The code appends the result of `int(x / i)` to the list `output2`. Given that `x` is divisible by `i`, `x / i` will be an integer. Therefore, `output2` will now contain this integer value.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing `i`; `output2` is a list containing `int(x / i)`; `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).**
