### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We have a line of `n` people.
- People are assigned numbers in a repeating pattern based on `k`.
- The pattern starts from `1` to `k`, then back down to `2` (excluding `k`), and repeats.
- The pattern length is `2k - 2`.
- Given Vasya's position `n` and assigned number `x`, we need to find all possible `k` values that fit this pattern.

#### Key Observations:
- The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
- For Vasya's position `n` and number `x`, we need to determine if there exists a `k` such that Vasya's position `n` maps to number `x` in the pattern.
- The position `n` in the pattern can be reduced modulo `2k - 2` to find its equivalent position in the first cycle.
- The number `x` can be either in the increasing part (`1` to `k`) or the decreasing part (`k-1` to `2`).

#### Approach:
- The code attempts to find all `k` values that satisfy the conditions by checking two possible scenarios:
  1. `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
  2. `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
- For each scenario, it finds divisors of the respective expression and checks if they can form valid `k` values.
- The function `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number.
- The code then filters these divisors to find valid `k` values.

#### Issues in the Code:
- The function `func_1` returns divisors in a specific order, but the filtering logic does not correctly handle all cases.
- The logic for checking valid `k` values is flawed. It should correctly map the position `n` to the pattern and verify if `x` is the assigned number.
- The code does not account for the fact that `k` must be greater than `x` in the increasing part and `k - x + 1` in the decreasing part.

#### Correctness:
Given the above observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid `k` values. It incorrectly filters divisors and does not correctly map positions to numbers in the pattern.

### Correctness: **False**
