### Reasoning:

The program's goal is to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit under the given constraints based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling process.

The program follows these steps for each test case:
1. It checks two conditions:
   - If \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \), it computes the divisors of \( (n + x - 2) \) and checks if \( k = \frac{s + 2}{2} \) meets the criteria \( k \geq x \) and is a natural number.
   - If \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \), it computes the divisors of \( (n - x) \) and checks if \( k = \frac{s + 2}{2} \) meets the criteria \( k \geq x \) and is a natural number.
2. It uses the function `func_1(x)` to find all divisors of a given number \( x \).
3. It collects all valid \( k \) values in the list `output`, removes duplicates using `set`, and prints the count of unique valid \( k \) values.

The function `func_1(x)` is designed to efficiently find all divisors of \( x \) by iterating up to the square root of \( x \). The divisors are then combined and sorted as described.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The logic for determining valid \( k \) values is based on the problem's constraints and the nature of the settling process described.
- The use of divisors to find possible \( k \) values is mathematically sound, as the settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the position \( n \) and number \( x \) can be used to derive potential \( k \) values.
- The program handles the constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) efficiently by leveraging the properties of divisors and the constraints on \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the provided examples and the problem description.
