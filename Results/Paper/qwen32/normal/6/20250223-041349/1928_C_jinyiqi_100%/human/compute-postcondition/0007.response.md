The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. Since the range parameters do not change during the loop, we only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value such that `1 ≤ i < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still satisfy the condition `i < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged if `x` is not divisible by the new `i`, or `output1` contains `i` and `output2` contains `int(x / i)` if `x` is divisible by the new `i`**.

Given that we only adjust `i` in the loop head, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1**.
