Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are either empty or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `x == y`, a new element from `lit[i]` is appended to `a`. If `x < y`, and `x >= lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `x < y`, `lit[i] < x`, and `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `x < y`, `lit[i] < x`, and `lit[i] <= y`, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` and `y` is set to `lit[i]` if `b` was empty. If `x >= y`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, `x`, or `y`.**
