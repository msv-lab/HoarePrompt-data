In the given for loop, the only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust those variables to ensure the loop can execute.

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust it before the loop starts.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0**
