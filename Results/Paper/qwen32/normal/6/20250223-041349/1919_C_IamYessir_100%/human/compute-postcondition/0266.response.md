Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, and `x` is equal to `y`. If `a` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`; otherwise, `x` is positive infinity. If `b` is empty, `y` is positive infinity; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. Since `x` is equal to `y`, both `x` and `y` hold the same value.**
