The code assigns the value of the last element of list `b` to variable `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `b` is not an empty list, `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is now stored in `y`.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is not an empty list, `cp` is 0, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is not an empty list and `x` is the last element of `a`.**
