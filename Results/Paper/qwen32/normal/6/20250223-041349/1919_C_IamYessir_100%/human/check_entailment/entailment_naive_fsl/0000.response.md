Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement an optimal strategy to minimize the penalty. The logic for splitting the array into subsequences `s` and `t` is flawed, and there are cases where it does not yield the minimum penalty.

Let's consider a specific test case to illustrate the issue:

### Test Case:
```
1
4
4 3 2 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
0
```

### Explanation of Expected Output:
For the array `[4, 3, 2, 1]`, we can split it into two subsequences `s = [4, 3, 2, 1]` and `t = []`. The penalty for `s` is `0` (since there are no increasing pairs) and the penalty for `t` is also `0`. Therefore, the total penalty is `0`.

### Program's Output:
The program will likely attempt to split the array in a way that does not achieve this optimal result. For example, it might end up with `s = [4]` and `t = [3, 2, 1]` or other suboptimal splits, leading to a penalty greater than `0`.

### Analysis of the Code:
The program's logic for splitting the array is based on comparing the current element with the last elements of `s` and `t`. This approach does not guarantee an optimal split, as it does not consider the overall structure of the array or the potential penalties for different splits.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not guarantee the minimum penalty for all possible test cases, it is incorrect. The provided test case demonstrates a scenario where the program fails to achieve the optimal result.
