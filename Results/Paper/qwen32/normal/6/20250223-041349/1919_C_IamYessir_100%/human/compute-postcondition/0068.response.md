Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `x == y`, no changes are made to lists `a` or `b`. Otherwise, if `x < y`, `lit[i]` is added to list `a` if `x >= lit[i]` or if `lit[i] > y`. If `y >= lit[i] > x`, `lit[i]` is appended to list `b`. If `x >= y`, no changes are made to lists `a` or `b`. `x` is set to the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`. `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.**
