Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not. `cp` is 0. `n` is greater than 0. `x` is positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x < y`, then `x < y` remains true. If `x >= lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x < lit[i]`, then `lit[i]` is added to the end of `b` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**
