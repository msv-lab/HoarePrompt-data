Postcondition: ***`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `lit[3]` is greater than `y`, then `lit[3]` is appended to `a`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[3]` and `lit[3]` is greater than `x`, then `lit[3]` is appended to `b`.***

This summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else conditions.
