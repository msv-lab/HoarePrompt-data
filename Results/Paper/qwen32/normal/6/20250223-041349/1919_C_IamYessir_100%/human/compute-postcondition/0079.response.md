The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Therefore, the list `a` will now include this new element, and the value of `x` will be updated to the last element of the list `a`, which is `lit[i]`.

Given the initial state, the list `a` is modified by adding the element `lit[i]` to it. The value of `x` will change to `lit[i]` since `x` is defined as the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty.

The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `a` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is `lit[i]`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`.**
