The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means that the list `b` will now contain one additional element, which is `lit[i]`.

The values of `a`, `cp`, `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y` are not directly affected by this operation, except for `b` which is modified.

Given the initial state, `a` and `b` can be either empty or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `x` and `y` are set based on the contents of `a` and `b` respectively.

After the code execution, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are either empty or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. `b` now contains the additional element `lit[i]`.**
