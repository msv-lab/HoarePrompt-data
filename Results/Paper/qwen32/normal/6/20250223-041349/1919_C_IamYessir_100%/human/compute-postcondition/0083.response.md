The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This changes the list `a` by adding one more element to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `cp`, `i`, `x`, `y`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `x` is either `float('inf')` if `lit` is empty, otherwise the last element of `lit`
- `y` is either `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise the last element of `b`

After the execution of the code snippet, the list `a` will have one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The value of `i` is `i + 2`, so the element at index `i + 2` of `lit` is appended to `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `lit` is empty, otherwise the last element of `lit`, `y` is either `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise the last element of `b`, `a` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it.**
