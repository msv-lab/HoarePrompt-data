The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value from input(), `lit` is the input list of integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, and `i` is `len(b) - 1`**.
