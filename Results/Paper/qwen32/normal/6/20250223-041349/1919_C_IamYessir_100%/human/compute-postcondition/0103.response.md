The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Given the initial state, `s` is either 1 or 2. Therefore, after the increment, `s` will be either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the number of elements in `lit`, `lit` is the input list of integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, and `s` is either 2 or 3. `i` is `i + 1`.**
