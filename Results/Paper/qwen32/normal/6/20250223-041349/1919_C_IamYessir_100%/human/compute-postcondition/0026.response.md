Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` was an empty list before the if-else block, or the last element of `a` before the if-else block if `a` was not empty. If `lit[i] > x`, then `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `y` remains `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b` if `b` was not empty. In all cases, `x` is greater than `y` and `lit[i]` is such that `x >= lit[i] > y`.**
