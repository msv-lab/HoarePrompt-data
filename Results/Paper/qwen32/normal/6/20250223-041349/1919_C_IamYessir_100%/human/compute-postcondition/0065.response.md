Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If `lit[i] > y`, then `lit[i]` is included in the list `a`. Otherwise, if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`.**
