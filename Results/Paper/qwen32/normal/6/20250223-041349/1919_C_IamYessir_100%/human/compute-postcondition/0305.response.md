Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is either `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise, and `y` is `float('inf')` if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of list `b` otherwise. If `x` equals `y`, then `lit[2]` is appended to list `a`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, and `x` is less than `y`, then `lit[2]` is appended to list `a`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, and `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, then `lit[2]` is appended to list `a`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` is less than `y`, `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, and `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, then `lit[2]` is appended to list `b`.**
