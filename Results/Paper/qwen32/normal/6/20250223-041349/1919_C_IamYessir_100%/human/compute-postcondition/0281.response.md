Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `x` remains the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, and `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If `x < y`, the following occurs: If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `a` may include `lit[i]` as its last element if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `b` and `y` remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is less than `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`. If `x` is not less than `y`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, `x`, or `y`.**
