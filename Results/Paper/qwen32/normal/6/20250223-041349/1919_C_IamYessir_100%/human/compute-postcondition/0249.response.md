Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is an empty list, and `len(b) == 0`, `cp` is 0, `y` is positive infinity. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is not an empty list and `x` is the last element of `a`.**

In natural language: The variable `y` has been assigned the value of positive infinity. All other variables retain their initial values.
