Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0. If `x > y`, then `lit[i]` is added to `a` if `x >= lit[i] > y` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty. If `y >= lit[i]`, then `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i] > x`, then `lit[i]` becomes the last element of `b`. If `lit[i] <= x`, then `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `x` and `y` are updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was empty before, `b` includes `lit[i]` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is not greater than `y`, `b` and `y` remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y` if the else part is executed.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes to the variables `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` based on the conditions in the if-else block, while retaining the initial conditions of `iterations`, `n`, `lit`, and `cp`.
