The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will have one more element, which is the element at index `i` of `lit`. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless specified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. `a` has an additional element which is `lit[i]`.**
