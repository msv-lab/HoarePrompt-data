Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0. If `x` was equal to `y`, `a` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `x` and `y` are now `lit[i]` if `a` was empty before. If `x` was less than `y`, `a` may include `lit[i]` as its last element if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is not greater than `y`, `b` and `y` remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y`.**
