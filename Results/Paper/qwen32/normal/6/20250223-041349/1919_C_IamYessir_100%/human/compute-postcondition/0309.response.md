The code snippet `x = a[-1]` updates the value of `x` to be the last element of the list `a`.

Given the initial state, `x` was either `float('inf')` if the length of `a` was 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise. After executing the code, `x` will definitely be the last element of list `a` (assuming `a` is non-empty as per the initial state description).

The other variables (`iterations`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is `float('inf')` if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of list `b` otherwise.**
