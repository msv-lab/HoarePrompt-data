The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `a` was either an empty list or not an empty list, after appending `lit[i]`, `a` will definitely not be an empty list. The values of `b`, `cp`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. However, since `a` is no longer empty, `x` will now be the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`a` is not an empty list, `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is `lit[i]`, `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**
