The code appends the `i`-th element of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means the list `b` will now have one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The value of `i` is not changed by this operation, nor are the values of `t`, `n`, `cp`, `x`, and `y`. The only change is in the list `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. The list `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
