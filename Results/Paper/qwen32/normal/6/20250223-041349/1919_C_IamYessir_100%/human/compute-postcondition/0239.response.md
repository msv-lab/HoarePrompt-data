The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `lit`. The variables `iterations` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string.**
