Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`. If `lit[i] > y`, then `a` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, and `y` remains unchanged. If `lit[i] <= y`, then `x` is the last element of `lit` or `float('inf')` based on the conditions provided. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `y` or `b`.**
