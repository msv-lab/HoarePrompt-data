The code snippet `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. Given the initial state, we need to consider the possible states of `b`.

Since `b` is either an empty list or not, we need to handle both cases:

1. If `b` is not an empty list, `y` will be the last element of `b`.
2. If `b` is an empty list, accessing `b[-1]` would raise an `IndexError`. However, based on the problem statement, we assume `b` is not empty when this line is executed.

Thus, the only valid case to consider is when `b` is not empty.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`.**
