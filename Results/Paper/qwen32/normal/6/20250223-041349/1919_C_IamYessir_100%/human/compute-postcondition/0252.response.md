Postcondition: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, and `x` remains the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is positive infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, then `y` is the last element of `b`.**
