The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3 and `lit` is a list of integers, the element at index 3 of `lit` is added to `a`. The values of `iterations`, `n`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The length of `a` increases by 1, and the last element of `a` is now the element at index 3 of `lit`.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is `float('inf')` if the length of `a` was 0, or the last element of list `a` before the append operation otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')` if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of list `b` otherwise, `a` has an additional element which is `lit[3]`.**
