The code snippet provided appends the current element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This operation modifies the list `a` by adding the element `lit[i]` to it. No other variables are directly affected by this operation according to the provided code snippet.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the list `a` which now includes the element `lit[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` was an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` was not an empty list. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `b` is not an empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. The list `a` now includes the element `lit[i]`.**
