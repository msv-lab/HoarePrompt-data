The given code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Based on the initial state, `i` is 2, so the element at index 2 of `lit` will be appended to `a`.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is either `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise, and `y` is `float('inf')` if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of list `b` otherwise, and `a` now includes the element `lit[2]` at the end.**

In natural language: The list `a` has been updated to include the element at index 2 of the list `lit` at its end. All other variables retain their original values or conditions.
