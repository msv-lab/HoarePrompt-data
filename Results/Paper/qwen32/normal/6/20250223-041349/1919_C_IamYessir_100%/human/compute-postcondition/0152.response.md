Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**
