The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that the variable `a` is now a list of integers based on the input provided.

The other variables `t`, `i`, `tc`, and `N` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided.**
