The code snippet appends `b` to the deque `nums`. This means that the deque `nums` will now have one more element, which is `b`, added to its end. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `nums` is a deque of `n` integers with `a` appended at the beginning and `b` appended at the end since `a` is greater than 0. `b` is greater than 0. `x` is recalculated as min(a, b) after possible modifications to `a` and `b`. If `k` >= 2 * `x`, then `k` is reduced by 2 * `x`, `a` is reduced by `x`, and `b` is reduced by `x`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.**
