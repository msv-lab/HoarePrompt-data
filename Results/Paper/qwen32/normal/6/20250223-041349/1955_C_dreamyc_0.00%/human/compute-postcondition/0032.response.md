Postcondition: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums` and potentially reduced by `x`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums` and potentially reduced by `x`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`. Otherwise, the `break` statement is executed. If `a` was not greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
