The value of `a` is decreased by `x`, where `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. The values of `k`, `nums`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums` minus the minimum of the first and last integers removed from `nums`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of the first and last integers removed from `nums`.**
