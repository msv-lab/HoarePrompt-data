Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 1 integer with `a` appended to the left, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums` and potentially reduced by `x`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums` and potentially reduced by `x`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`. Otherwise, the `break` statement is executed.**

In simple terms, `a` has been appended to the left of `nums`, and `a` and `b` may have been reduced by `x` if `k` was greater than or equal to `2 * x`. The conditions for `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain as specified, with the only change being the addition of `a` to the left of `nums`.
