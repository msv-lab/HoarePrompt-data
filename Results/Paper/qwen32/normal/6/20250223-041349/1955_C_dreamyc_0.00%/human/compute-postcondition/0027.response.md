The value of `k` is decreased by `2 * x`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0 minus `2 * x`, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums` minus the minimum of the first and last integers removed from `nums`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums` minus the minimum of the first and last integers removed from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of the first and last integers removed from `nums`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0 minus `2 * x`; `nums` has at least 1 integer; `a` is the first integer removed from `nums` minus the minimum of the first and last integers removed from `nums`; `b` is the last integer removed from `nums` minus the minimum of the first and last integers removed from `nums`; `x` is the minimum of the first and last integers removed from `nums`.**
