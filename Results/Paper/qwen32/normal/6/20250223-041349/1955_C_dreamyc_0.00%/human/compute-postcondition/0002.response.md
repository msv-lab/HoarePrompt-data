To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head: `while k and len(nums) >= 2:`. This means that for the loop to execute, both `k` must be non-zero and the length of `nums` must be at least 2.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15.
- `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `ans` is 0.

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. **`k` must be non-zero**: The initial state specifies that `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, which means `k` is already guaranteed to be non-zero.
2. **`len(nums) >= 2`**: The initial state specifies that `nums` is a deque of `n` integers, and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. However, it does not specify the exact value of `n`. To ensure the loop executes, we need `n` to be at least 2.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` (the length of `nums`) is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `ans` is 0**.
