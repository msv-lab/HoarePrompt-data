To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables `k`, `nums`, and `ans`. The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is greater than 0 and there are at least 2 elements in the deque `nums`. In each iteration, the loop removes the first and last elements of `nums`, calculates the minimum of these two elements (`x`), and then checks if `k` is at least `2 * x`. If it is, `k` is reduced by `2 * x`, and both elements are reduced by `x`. If either element becomes 0, it is not added back to `nums`, and `ans` is incremented. If `k` is less than `2 * x`, the loop breaks.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final state will be when either `k` becomes 0 or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. At this point, the loop terminates, and the final values of `k`, `nums`, and `ans` are determined.

Let's break down the final state:

1. **`k`**: This will be the remaining value after all possible reductions. If `k` was sufficiently large to reduce all possible pairs, `k` will be 0. Otherwise, `k` will be the remainder after the last reduction that did not fully utilize `k`.

2. **`nums`**: This will be the remaining elements in the deque after all possible reductions. If `k` was large enough to reduce all pairs to 0, `nums` will be empty or contain elements that could not be paired (i.e., an odd number of elements). If `k` was not large enough to reduce all pairs, `nums` will contain the elements that were not reduced.

3. **`ans`**: This will be the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums`. Each time an element is reduced to 0, `ans` is incremented.

The final output state can be described as follows:
- `k` will be the remaining value after all possible reductions.
- `nums` will be the remaining elements in the deque after all possible reductions.
- `ans` will be the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums`.

Since the exact values of `k`, `nums`, and `ans` depend on the initial values and the specific behavior of the loop, we can summarize the output state as:

Output State: **`k` is the remaining value after all possible reductions, `nums` contains the remaining elements after all possible reductions, and `ans` is the count of elements that were reduced to 0 and removed from `nums`.**

In simpler terms, the final state of the loop is when no more pairs can be reduced due to either `k` being exhausted or fewer than two elements remaining in `nums`. The values of `k`, `nums`, and `ans` reflect this final condition.
