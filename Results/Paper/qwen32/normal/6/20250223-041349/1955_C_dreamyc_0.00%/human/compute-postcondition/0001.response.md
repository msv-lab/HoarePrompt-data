The code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `ans` is 0.**
