Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `a` is the first integer removed from `nums` minus the minimum of the first and last integers removed from `nums`, `b` is the last integer removed from `nums` minus the minimum of the first and last integers removed from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of the first and last integers removed from `nums`.**

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated to be `b - x`. The values of `k`, `nums`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
