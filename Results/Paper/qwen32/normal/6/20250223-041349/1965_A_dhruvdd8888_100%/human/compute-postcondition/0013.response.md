The code snippet `ls += nums[i]` appends the element `nums[i]` to the list `ls`. Given the initial state, `ls` is initially a list containing `nums[i]` twice. After the operation, `ls` will contain `nums[i]` three times.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input set of strings and must have at least 1 element where `nums[i]` is 0, `ls` is a list containing `nums[i]` three times, `i` is `i + 1` such that `i < len(nums)`**.
