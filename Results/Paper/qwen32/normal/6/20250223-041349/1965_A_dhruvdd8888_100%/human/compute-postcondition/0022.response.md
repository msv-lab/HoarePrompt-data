Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `True`, and `cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` is equal to 1. Otherwise, `cw` remains `True` and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.**
