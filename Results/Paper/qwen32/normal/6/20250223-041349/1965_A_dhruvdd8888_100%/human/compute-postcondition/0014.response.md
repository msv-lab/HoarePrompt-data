To determine the final state of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
    - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
    - `N` is an input integer.
    - `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input set of strings.
    - `ls` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Body**:
    - For each element in `nums`, the loop performs the following:
        - `nums[i] -= ls` modifies the current element by subtracting the cumulative sum `ls`.
        - `ls += nums[i]` updates the cumulative sum `ls` by adding the modified current element.

### Iteration Analysis:
- **First Iteration**:
    - `nums[0] -= ls` → `nums[0] -= 0` → `nums[0]` remains unchanged.
    - `ls += nums[0]` → `ls = nums[0]`.

- **Second Iteration**:
    - `nums[1] -= ls` → `nums[1] -= nums[0]`.
    - `ls += nums[1]` → `ls = nums[0] + (nums[1] - nums[0])` → `ls = nums[1]`.

- **Third Iteration**:
    - `nums[2] -= ls` → `nums[2] -= nums[1]`.
    - `ls += nums[2]` → `ls = nums[1] + (nums[2] - nums[1])` → `ls = nums[2]`.

### General Iteration:
- For any `i`, the loop modifies `nums[i]` by subtracting the cumulative sum up to the previous element and then adds this modified value to the cumulative sum.
- Effectively, `nums[i]` becomes the difference between the current element and the sum of all previous elements, and `ls` becomes the cumulative sum up to the current element.

### Final Output State:
- After all iterations, each element in `nums` will be the difference between the original element and the cumulative sum of all previous elements.
- The final value of `ls` will be the sum of all elements in the original `nums`.

### Conclusion:
- **Output State**: `t` remains the same, `N` remains the same, `nums` is transformed such that each element is the difference between the original element and the cumulative sum of all previous elements, and `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list where each element is the difference between the original element and the cumulative sum of all previous elements, and `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`.**
