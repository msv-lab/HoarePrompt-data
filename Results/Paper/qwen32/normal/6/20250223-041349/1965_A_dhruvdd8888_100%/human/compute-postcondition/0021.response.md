Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `True`, `cw` is `True`, and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cw = True` does not change the value of `cw` since it is already `True`. Therefore, no variables are affected, and the initial state remains unchanged.
