The code snippet `cw = not nw` changes the value of `cw` based on the value of `nw`. Since `nw` is `True` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, and `cw` was initially set to the same value as `nw`, the new value of `cw` will be the opposite of `nw`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `True` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `False`, and `cw` is `False` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`, and `i` is `len(nums) - 2`.**
