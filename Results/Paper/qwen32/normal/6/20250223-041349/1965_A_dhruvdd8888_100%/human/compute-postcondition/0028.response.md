The code snippet `nw = cw` assigns the value of `cw` to `nw`. Given the initial state, `nw` was `False` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` was `True`. Similarly, `cw` was `True` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `cw` was `False`. By executing `nw = cw`, `nw` will now have the same value as `cw`.

Therefore, if `cw` is `True`, `nw` will be `True`, and if `cw` is `False`, `nw` will be `False`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `True` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `False`, `cw` is `True` if any element in `nums` is equal to 1, otherwise `cw` is `False`, and `i` is 0.**
