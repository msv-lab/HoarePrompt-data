The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into parts, and then converts these parts into a set. This means that `nums` will be a set containing unique elements from the input string.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, and `N` is an input integer. The variable `N` is not used in the provided code snippet, so its value remains unchanged. The variable `nums` is newly defined and will hold the unique elements from the input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an input integer; `nums` is a set of unique strings from the input.**
