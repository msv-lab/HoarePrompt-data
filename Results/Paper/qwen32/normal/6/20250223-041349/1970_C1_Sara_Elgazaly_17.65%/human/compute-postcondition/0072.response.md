The code snippet `s = not s` flips the boolean value of `s`. Given that `s` is the opposite of its initial value in the initial state, after executing the code, `s` will revert to its original value. Therefore, the variables `lst[x]`, `y`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst[x]` is empty, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`, `x` remains the original `x`, and `s` is the original value of `s`.**
