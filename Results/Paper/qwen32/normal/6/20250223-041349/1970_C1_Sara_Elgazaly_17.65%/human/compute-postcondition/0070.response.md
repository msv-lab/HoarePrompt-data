Postcondition: **`lst[x]` contains all elements except the last one that was removed, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, then `x` is set to the value of `y` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `x` and the execution continues.**
