The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `x` and `y`, but it does specify the conditions for `n` and `t`, and the structure of the tree.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms, the output state retains all the initial conditions about `n`, `t`, and the tree structure. The variables `x` and `y` now hold the values that were read from the input.
