The code `y = lst[x].pop()` removes the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. Given that `x` is 3, the last element of `lst[3]` is removed and `y` is updated to this value. The initial state specifies that `y` is the last element of `lst[3]` before it was removed, so after the execution, `y` will hold the value that was the last element of `lst[3]` before the `pop` operation, and `lst[3]` will be one element shorter.

Output State: **`lst` is `[[1, 2], ..., [non-empty list except the last element has been removed from lst[3]], ...]`; `y` is the last element of the original `lst[3]`; `x` is 3.**
