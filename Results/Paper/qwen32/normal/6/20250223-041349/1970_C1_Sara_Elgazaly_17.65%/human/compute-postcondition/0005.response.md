The code snippet `lst[b].append(a)` modifies the `defaultdict` `lst` by appending the value `a` to the list associated with the key `b`. This means that the list at `lst[b]` will now include `a` as an additional element.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the `lst` dictionary. Specifically, `lst[b]` will have `a` added to its list of values. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value and `lst[b]` now includes `a`. `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
