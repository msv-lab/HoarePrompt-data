The value of `x` is updated to be equal to `y`. The values of `lst` and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, `lst` is still `[[1, 2], ..., [non-empty list except the last element has been removed from lst[3]], ...]`, `y` is still the last element of the original `lst[3]`, and `x` is now equal to `y`.

Output State: **`lst` is `[[1, 2], ..., [non-empty list except the last element has been removed from lst[3]], ...]`; `y` is the last element of the original `lst[3]`; `x` is equal to `y`.**
