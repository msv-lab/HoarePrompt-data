You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    1 1 2 3
    
    8
    
    7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5
    
    8
    
    7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    1
    2
    1
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program:
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of cards and a list of integers on those cards. It calculates and prints the difference between the total number of card integers and the number of unique card integers for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The program simply calculates the difference between the number of cards and the number of unique card values in the player's hand. This calculation does not take into account the optimal play strategy for either player or the alternating turns.

Let's analyze the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4`, `1 1 2 3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1`
   - The program seems to work for this case, but this is by coincidence and not due to correct logic.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `8`, `7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2`
   - Again, the program seems to work for this case, but this is not due to correct logic.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `8`, `7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `3`
   - Here, the program gives an incorrect output. The correct output should be `1`, but the program outputs `3`, indicating that the logic is flawed.

The program does not simulate the game or consider the optimal moves for Nene or the player. It simply calculates a value that does not correspond to the maximum number of points the player can get by playing optimally.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game considering the optimal moves for both players. This involves keeping track of the cards on the table and making decisions based on the current state of the game.

Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(input[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[idx])
        idx += 1
        cards = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        from collections import Counter
        card_count = Counter(cards)
        table = set()
        player_points = 0
        nene_points = 0
        for turn in range(n):
            if turn % 2 == 0:  # Player's turn
                for card in cards:
                    if card_count[card] > 0:
                        if card in table:
                            player_points += 1
                        table.add(card)
                        card_count[card] -= 1
                        break
            else:  # Nene's turn
                max_points = -1
                best_card = None
                for card in cards:
                    if card_count[card] > 0:
                        if card in table:
                            points = nene_points + 1
                        else:
                            points = nene_points
                        if points > max_points or (points == max_points and card in table):
                            max_points = points
                            best_card = card
                if best_card is not None:
                    if best_card in table:
                        nene_points += 1
                    table.add(best_card)
                    card_count[best_card] -= 1
        results.append(player_points)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# func()  # Uncomment this line to run the function with input from stdin
```

This implementation correctly simulates the game and considers the optimal moves for both players.
