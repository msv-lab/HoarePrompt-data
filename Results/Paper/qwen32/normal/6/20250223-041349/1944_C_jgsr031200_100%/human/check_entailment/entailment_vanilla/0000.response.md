Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Determine the final score (MEX) of array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally.
- **Game Rules:**
  - Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
  - Players take turns picking an element from array `a`, appending it to `c` (only Alice does this), and removing it from `a`.
  - The game ends when `a` is empty.
- **Optimal Play:**
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
  - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
- **MEX Definition:** The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` to count occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through `a` and updates the frequency of each element.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The program initializes a counter `cou` to zero.
   - It iterates through the `freq` array to find the smallest index `i` such that `freq[i]` is either 0 or 1.
   - If `freq[i]` is 0, it means `i` is not present in `a` at all, so it prints `i` and breaks.
   - If `freq[i]` is 1, it increments `cou`. If `cou` reaches 2, it means there are at least two distinct elements that appear exactly once in `a`. In this case, the MEX is `i`, so it prints `i` and breaks.

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly calculates the frequency of each element in `a`.
- It correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in `a` or appears exactly once, which is the MEX of `c` after the game ends.
- The logic to determine the MEX is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly determine the MEX of `c` after the game ends, given optimal play by both Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: True**
