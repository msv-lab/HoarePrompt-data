### Reasoning

The original assessment suggests that the program correctly determines the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to validate this claim.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally.
- **Alice's Strategy**: Maximize the MEX by moving the smallest possible integers to `c`.
- **Bob's Strategy**: Minimize the MEX by preventing Alice from moving the smallest integers to `c`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program uses a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each integer in the input array `arr`. It then iterates through this frequency array to find the smallest integer that appears zero or one time, which will be the MEX of `c`.

#### Annotations:
- The frequency array `freq` is correctly initialized to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- The program iterates through the frequency array from `0` to `n` (inclusive) and identifies the smallest integer that appears zero or one time, which is printed as the MEX.

#### Key Points:
1. **Frequency Count**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
2. **Finding MEX**: The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that appears zero or one time in the frequency array, which is the MEX of `c`.

#### Validation Against the Problem Description:
- **Alice's Optimal Move**: Alice should move the smallest integers that appear only once to `c` to maximize the MEX. The program correctly identifies these integers.
- **Bob's Optimal Move**: Bob should prevent Alice from moving the smallest integers to `c`. However, since the program only identifies the smallest integer that appears zero or one time, it inherently accounts for Bob's strategy by ensuring that the MEX is minimized for Bob.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of `c` after the game ends. The program efficiently counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr` and finds the smallest integer that appears zero or one time, which is the MEX of `c`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description, code, and annotations.
