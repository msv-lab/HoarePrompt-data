Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`; `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`; `cou` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if freq[i] >= 2:
        continue
    if freq[i] == 1:
        cou += 1
    if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`. `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`. If `freq[i]` was exactly 1 before the if statement, `cou` is set to 1; otherwise, `cou` remains 0. `n` must be at least 0. If `freq[i]` is at least 2, its value remains unchanged. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`. `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`. `n` is at least 0. `i` is incremented by 1. If `freq[i]` was exactly 1 before the if statement, `cou` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `cou` remains 0. If `cou` was 2 or `freq[i]` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`. `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `arr`. `n` is at least 0. `i` is 4. If `cou` was 2 or `freq[i]` was 0 before the if statement, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `freq[i]` was exactly 1 before the if statement, `cou` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `cou` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
