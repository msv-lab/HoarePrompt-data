The given code snippet `freq[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the `freq` list by 1. The precondition specifies that `freq` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, where each element in `arr` is between `0` and `len(arr) - 1`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific index in `freq` that will be incremented. However, we know that after the operation, the value at `freq[i]` will be 1 (since it was initially 0).

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for each index `i`, and `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the integer at index `i` is 1 and all other integers remain 0.**
