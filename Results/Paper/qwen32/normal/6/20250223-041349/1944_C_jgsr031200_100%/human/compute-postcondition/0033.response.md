To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

The initial state describes the following:
- `arr` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where each element is between `0` and `len(arr) - 1`.
- `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `freq[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `arr`.
- `n` is at least `0`.
- `i` is explicitly set to `4`.
- The behavior of `cou` is described based on the value of `freq[i]`, but this does not affect the `print(i)` statement.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly set to `4` in the initial state, the `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **4**
