Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a game played by Alice and Bob on an array `a`. The goal is to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been moved to `c` according to the rules.

- Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
- Alice moves an element to `c` and removes it from `a`.
- Bob removes an element from `a` without moving it to `c`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.

The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

### Key Observations
1. If an integer appears twice or more in `a`, it does not affect the final MEX because it can be moved to `c` by Alice and then removed by Bob, or vice versa.
2. Alice should aim to move the smallest possible integers to `c` to maximize the MEX.
3. Bob should aim to prevent Alice from moving the smallest possible integers to `c` to minimize the MEX.
4. The optimal strategy for Alice is to move the smallest integers that appear only once to `c`.
5. The optimal strategy for Bob is to remove any integer that appears only once if Alice has not moved it to `c`.

### Correctness of the Program
The program uses a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`. It then iterates through the frequency array to find the smallest integer that appears zero or one time, which will be the MEX of `c` after the game ends.

- The frequency array `freq` is initialized to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
- The program then iterates through the frequency array from `0` to `n` (inclusive).
- If an integer appears zero or one time, it is the MEX of `c` because Alice can move the smallest such integer to `c` before Bob can remove it.

### Implementation Details
- The program correctly initializes the frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
- It then iterates through the frequency array to find the smallest integer that appears zero or one time, which is the MEX of `c`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of `c` after the game ends. The program efficiently counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and finds the smallest integer that appears zero or one time, which is the MEX of `c`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
