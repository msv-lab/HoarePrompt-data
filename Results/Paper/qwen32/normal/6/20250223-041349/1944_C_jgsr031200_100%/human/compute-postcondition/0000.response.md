The code snippet initializes a list `freq` with `n + 1` zeros, where `n` is the length of the input list `arr`. The initial condition about `arr` remains unchanged, and the new list `freq` is added to the state.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 <= arr[i] < len(arr) for each index i, and the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `freq` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
