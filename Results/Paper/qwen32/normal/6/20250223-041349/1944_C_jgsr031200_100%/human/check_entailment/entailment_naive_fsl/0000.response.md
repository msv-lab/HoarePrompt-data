Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game strategy described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calculates the MEX of the array `arr` by counting the frequency of each number and finding the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array. However, this does not take into account the turns taken by Alice and Bob and their strategies to maximize and minimize the MEX score, respectively.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work as expected:

**Test Case:**
```
2
3
0 1 1
3
0 0 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
0
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**

1. For the first test case with input `3 0 1 1`, the optimal strategy leads to a MEX of 2. Alice and Bob can play in such a way that the final array `c` is `[0, 1, 1]` or any permutation thereof, which has a MEX of 2.

2. For the second test case with input `3 0 0 1`, the optimal strategy leads to a MEX of 1. Alice and Bob can play in such a way that the final array `c` is `[0, 0, 1]` or any permutation thereof, which has a MEX of 1.

The provided code does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob and does not account for their strategies. Instead, it simply calculates the MEX of the given array without considering the game dynamics. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

To make the code correct, it would need to simulate the game turns and strategies of Alice and Bob, taking into account their goals of maximizing and minimizing the MEX score, respectively.
