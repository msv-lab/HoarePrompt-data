The code reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
