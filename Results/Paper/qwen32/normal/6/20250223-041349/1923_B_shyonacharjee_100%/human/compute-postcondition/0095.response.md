Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `x`. The list `a` contains `n` integers, and the list `x` contains `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, none of which are zero. The function returns a value or values based on the provided inputs for each test case.**
