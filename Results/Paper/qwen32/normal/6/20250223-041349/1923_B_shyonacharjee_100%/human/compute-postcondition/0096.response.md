Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `x`. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters, where each monster has a position `x[i]` and health `a[i]`, using bullets with a maximum range of `k` units. The function prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated without exceeding the bullet range for any monster, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
