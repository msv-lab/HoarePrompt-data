Output State: **`pos` is `next_pos`; `health` is `next_health`; `distance` is `abs(next_pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`.**

Explanation: The value of `total_bullets_needed` is calculated as the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`. The values of `pos`, `health`, and `distance` remain unchanged.
