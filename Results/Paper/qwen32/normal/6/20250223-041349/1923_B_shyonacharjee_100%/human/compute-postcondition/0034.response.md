The code snippet provided reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `a`. This operation does not affect the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`, `can_survive`), and their values remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x`; `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all processed monsters; `can_survive` is True if the total bullets needed never exceeded the distance times k for any monster, otherwise False.**
