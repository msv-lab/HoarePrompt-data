The code snippet provided is `hd -= 1`, which means the value of `hd` is decreased by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `res`, `_`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 1, `s1` is the newly input string, `s2` is the next input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`, `hd` is updated based on the conditions provided and then decreased by 1, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' otherwise `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`, `_` is `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
