The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables directly but controls the flow of the loop. Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `hd` remain unchanged because `continue` does not modify these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `hd` is decreased by 1.**
