Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 1, `s1` is the newly input string, `s2` is the next input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `hd` > 0, then `hd` is decreased by 1. If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`, then `res` is increased by 1.**
