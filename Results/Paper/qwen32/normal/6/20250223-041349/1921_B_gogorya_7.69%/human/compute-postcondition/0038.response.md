The code snippet `res = abs(a1 - a2)` updates the value of `res` to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `_` is incremented by 1**.
