The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make the number of '1's in `s1` equal to the number of '1's in `s2` by flipping '0's in `s1` to '1's.
