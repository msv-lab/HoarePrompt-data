Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2` and if `hd` was greater than 0, it is now `hd - 1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`; `_` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `res`, which is now `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` because `1` has been added to it. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
