The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no loop structure, so the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the flow of the program in the given context.

Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 1, `s1` is the newly input string, `s2` is the next input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `hd` is decreased by 1.**
