Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `s` and `f` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters only. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `f`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the code snippet provided.
