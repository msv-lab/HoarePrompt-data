Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 1, `s1` is the newly input string, `s2` is the next input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. Otherwise, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`. If `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is decreased by 1. `_` is `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `hd` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `hd`.**
