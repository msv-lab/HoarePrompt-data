Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine whether a given array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their digits and inserting them back into the array at the same position.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Transformation Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
   - If the current element is less than the previous one (`list1[p - 1] > list1[p]`) and the previous element is greater than 10 (`list1[p - 1] > 10`), it attempts to split the previous element.
   - The previous element is split into its tens and units digits, and these digits are inserted back into the array at the same position.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After attempting to transform the array, the program calls a function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
   - The function `func_1` compares the array with its sorted version and returns `True` if they are the same, otherwise `False`.

4. **Output:**
   - Based on the result from `func_1`, the program prints 'Yes' if the array can be sorted, otherwise 'No'.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Transformation Logic:**
   - The transformation logic only handles a single pass through the array and only splits the previous element if it is greater than the current element and greater than 10.
   - However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that the array can be sorted. For example, consider the array `[12, 10, 3]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 10, 3]` but will not handle the `10` which should be split into `1` and `0`.
   - The program should continue to iterate through the array and attempt to split elements until no more splits are possible or the array is sorted.

2. **Infinite Loop Possibility:**
   - The current logic does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed to sort the array. It only performs one pass and may not handle all necessary splits.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where splitting does not help in sorting the array.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements. It only performs a single pass and does not handle all necessary transformations.

**Correctness: False**
