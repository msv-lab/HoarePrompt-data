You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the following t lines, there is an integer x such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: `i` is equal to `t`, and all `x` values have been processed, with their corresponding `y` values (`x - 1`) printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program should output any such \( y \) for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \). It then sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints \( y \).

### Correctness Analysis:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to check whether setting \( y = x - 1 \) always results in the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

- **GCD Consideration**: 
  - The GCD of \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) is always 1 because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers and are coprime (they share no common divisors other than 1).

- **Sum Calculation**:
  - When \( y = x - 1 \), the sum becomes \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \).

- **Maximization Check**:
  - We need to verify if this is indeed the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for any \( y \) in the range \( 1 \leq y < x \).
  - For any other \( y \) less than \( x \), \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be less than or equal to \( y \). Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will be less than or equal to \( 2y \), which will always be less than \( x \) for \( y < x - 1 \).
  - For \( y = x - 1 \), we have already shown that the sum is \( x \), which is the highest possible value because \( \gcd(x, y) \) cannot be greater than \( y \).

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, setting \( y = x - 1 \) always results in the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Thus, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
