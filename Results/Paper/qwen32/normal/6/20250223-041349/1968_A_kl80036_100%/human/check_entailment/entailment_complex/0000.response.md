### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program provided always selects \( y = x - 1 \). We need to determine if this choice of \( y \) guarantees the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

1. **Understanding the choice \( y = x - 1 \)**:
   - When \( y = x - 1 \), the greatest common divisor \( \gcd(x, x-1) \) is always 1 because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers, and consecutive integers are always coprime.

2. **Evaluating the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**:
   - For \( y = x - 1 \), the expression becomes \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \).
   - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = x \).

3. **Checking if this is the maximum possible value**:
   - The maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for \( 1 \leq y < x \) is \( x \) because \( \gcd(x, y) \) can be at most \( x \) when \( y = x \), but \( y \) cannot be \( x \) as per the problem constraints.
   - Hence, \( x \) is indeed the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) when \( y = x - 1 \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the program always selects \( y = x - 1 \) and this choice guarantees the maximum value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
