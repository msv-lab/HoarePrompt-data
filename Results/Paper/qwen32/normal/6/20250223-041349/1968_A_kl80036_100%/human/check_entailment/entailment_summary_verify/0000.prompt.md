You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each of the following `t` lines, it reads an integer `x` and prints `x - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program always outputs `y = x - 1` for each test case. While this might work for some values of `x`, it does not necessarily yield the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate why this program is incorrect:

For `x = 7`, the program outputs `y = 6`. Here, \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\).

However, if we consider `y = 3`, then \(\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\).

For `x = 10`, the program outputs `y = 9`. Here, \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).

But if we consider `y = 5`, then \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).

For `x = 21`, the program outputs `y = 20`. Here, \(\gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21\).

But if we consider `y = 18`, then \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21\).

In some cases, `y = x - 1` might yield the correct result, but it's not guaranteed to be the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for all values of `x`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
