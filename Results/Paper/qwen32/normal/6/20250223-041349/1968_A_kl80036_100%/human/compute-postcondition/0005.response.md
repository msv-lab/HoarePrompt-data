The code snippet `x = int(input())` takes a new integer input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, `t`, and `i` are affected as follows:
- `x` is reassigned to the new input integer.
- `y` was previously defined as `x - 1`, but since `x` has changed, the new value of `y` is not recalculated in this snippet.
- `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is the new input integer, `y` is the previous value of `x - 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
