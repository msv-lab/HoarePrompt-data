The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that the input values must be integers greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0.**

This means that after the code has been executed, `n` and `m` will each hold integer values that are greater than 0, as per the precondition provided.
