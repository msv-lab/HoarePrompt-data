Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m` and is not a power of two, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is now the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix that Python includes when converting an integer to a binary string using the `bin()` function. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `k`) retain their original values and conditions.
