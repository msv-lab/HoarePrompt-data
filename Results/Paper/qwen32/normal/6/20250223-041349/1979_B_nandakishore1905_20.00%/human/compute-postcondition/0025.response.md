The code snippet assigns the binary representation of `k` (the absolute value of `n - m`) to the variable `l`, removing the '0b' prefix that Python includes in binary literals.

Given the initial state, the value of `l` is now the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and potentially `p`, `q`, `i` if `k` is not a power of 2) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. If `k` is a power of 2, no additional variables are defined. Otherwise, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2, `i` is `i + 1`.**
