You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers, and prints a specific value based on the relationship between the two integers. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between the two integers and applies different logic to determine the output value, which is then printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the length of the longest common subsegment of the two sequences \(a\) and \(b\) as defined in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads multiple test cases, each with two integers \(x\) and \(y\). It then calculates the absolute difference \(k = |x - y|\) and uses this value to determine the length of the longest common subsegment.

#### Key Points:
1. **Bitwise XOR Property:**
   - The sequences \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) are defined as \(a_n = n \oplus x\) and \(b_n = n \oplus y\).
   - For a common subsegment of length \(m\), we need \(a_i = b_j\), \(a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}\), and so on.
   - This implies \((i \oplus x) = (j \oplus y)\), \((i+1 \oplus x) = (j+1 \oplus y)\), and so on.
   - Simplifying, we get \(i \oplus x = j \oplus y\) and \(i+1 \oplus x = j+1 \oplus y\), which implies \(i \oplus j = x \oplus y\) and \((i+1) \oplus (j+1) = x \oplus y\).
   - This means that the difference \(x \oplus y\) must be a power of 2 for the sequences to align in a common subsegment.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program calculates \(k = |x - y|\).
   - It checks if \(k\) is a power of 2 using the condition \(k \& (k - 1) == 0\).
   - If \(k\) is a power of 2, it prints \(k\).
   - If \(k\) is not a power of 2, it handles special cases where \(x\) or \(y\) is 0 and the other is odd or even.
   - For other cases, it calculates the length of the binary representation of \(k\), finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\), and subtracts this from \(k\).

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify the correctness of the program against the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: \(x = 0\), \(y = 1\)
   - \(k = 1\) (which is \(2^0\), a power of 2)
   - Output: 1 (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: \(x = 12\), \(y = 4\)
   - \(k = 8\) (which is \(2^3\), a power of 2)
   - Output: 8 (Correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: \(x = 57\), \(y = 37\)
   - \(k = 20\) (which is not a power of 2)
   - The program calculates the longest common subsegment length correctly as 4.
   - Output: 4 (Correct)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: \(x = 316560849\), \(y = 14570961\)
   - \(k = 301989888\) (which is \(2^{28}\), a power of 2)
   - Output: 33554432 (Incorrect, should be \(2^{28} = 268435456\))

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly compute the longest common subsegment length for the fourth example. The issue arises because the program incorrectly calculates the longest common subsegment length when \(k\) is not a power of 2. The logic for handling non-power-of-2 values seems flawed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
