Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, and `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then no additional variables are defined. Otherwise, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.**
