Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are the new input integers. `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `n == 0` and `m % 2 == 0`, the state of `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remains as described in the precondition, and `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1.**
