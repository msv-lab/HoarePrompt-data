Let's break down the given information step by step to determine the output of the `print(k)` statement.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `m` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`.
   - `k` is a power of 2.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` and `m` are both positive integers.
   - `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., `k = |n - m|`.
   - The additional condition specifies that `k` must be a power of 2. This means `k` can be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`.
   - Since `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and must be a power of 2, the exact numerical value of `k` can vary depending on the specific values of `n` and `m` as long as their difference is a power of 2.

Given the information, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `k` without knowing the specific values of `n` and `m`. However, we know that `k` will be one of the powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.).

**Output:**
Output: **k (where k is a power of 2 and the absolute value of the difference between n and m)**
