Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is 0, `l` is 2, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, `r` and `l` remain unchanged. `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `sm` is `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[2 + 1:]) + (2 - 0 + 1)`.**
