### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying several critical issues with the provided code. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function is intended to find the best subarray to replace to maximize the sum. However, it calculates the sum incorrectly by adding `(j - i + 1) ** 2` to the sum of elements outside the subarray. This is not the correct approach to calculate the MEX value, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The MEX value should be computed for the subarray, and the subarray should be replaced with this MEX value to maximize the sum. The current implementation does not compute the MEX value at all.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function seems to be intended to generate a sequence of operations, but the operations it generates do not align with the goal of maximizing the sum by replacing subarrays with their MEX values. The recursive calls and operations appended do not correctly simulate the process of replacing subarrays with their MEX values.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function attempts to replace a subarray with its MEX value and generate operations. However, it incorrectly checks for the minimum value in the subarray and appends unnecessary operations. It also does not correctly compute the MEX value.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the following steps need to be taken:
- Compute the MEX value for each subarray.
- Replace the subarray with this MEX value if it increases the sum.
- Track the operations performed.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider the following input:
```
3
1 3 9
```
The correct output is:
```
13 0
```
The provided code might not handle this case correctly because it does not properly compute the MEX value and does not perform the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original assessment, the code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by replacing subarrays with their MEX values. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the code is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
