The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement, `j` iterates from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `j` would have taken some value between `i + 1` and `len(lst) - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, provided that it is still less than `len(lst)`. The other variables (`lst`, `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, `sm`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

Given that `i` is 0, `j` should start from `i + 1` which is 1. If the loop has already executed for `j = 1`, then for the next iteration, `j` should be 2, and so on, until `j` reaches `len(lst) - 1`.

Since the task is to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we assume that `j` has just finished an iteration and is about to be incremented.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1**.

Note: If `j` was already 1 in the previous iteration, it will be 2 in the current iteration. However, since the task is to describe the state at the start of the next iteration, we describe it as `j` being 1, ready to be incremented to 2. If `j` was already 2 in the previous iteration, it will be 3 in the current iteration, and so on. The key is to describe the state right before `j` is incremented.
