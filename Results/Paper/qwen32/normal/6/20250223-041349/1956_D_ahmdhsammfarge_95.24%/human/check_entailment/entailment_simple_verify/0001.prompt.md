You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by performing operations where we choose a subarray and set all its elements to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray. The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. The maximum sum should be achieved, and we need to provide the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function attempts to find the best subarray `[i, j]` to perform the operation on, trying to maximize the sum of the array after the operation.
   - It computes the sum if the subarray `[i, j]` is set to `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. The MEX value should be used instead of the square of the length of the subarray.
   - Therefore, this function is flawed because it does not compute the MEX value correctly and instead uses a heuristic that is not guaranteed to maximize the sum.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is recursive and seems to be adding operations to the list `ops` in a way that is not clearly justified by the problem requirements.
   - The logic within this function does not seem to align with the problem's goal of maximizing the sum by using the MEX value.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function performs the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` by setting all elements to `n` (the length of the subarray), which is incorrect. It should set all elements to the MEX value of the subarray.
   - It also adds operations to the list `ops` in a manner that is not clearly justified and does not align with the problem's goal.

### Conclusion:
- The provided code does not correctly compute the MEX value for subarrays.
- The operations performed do not align with the problem's goal of maximizing the sum by using the MEX value.
- The logic within the functions is flawed and does not guarantee that the maximum sum will be achieved.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis above, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
