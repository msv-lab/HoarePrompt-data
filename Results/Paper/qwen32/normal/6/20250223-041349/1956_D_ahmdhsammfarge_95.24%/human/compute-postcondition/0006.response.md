Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` has been added to `ops` twice. Additionally, `ops` now contains `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**

Explanation: The operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` has been appended to the list `ops` once as per the given code snippet. However, the initial state already mentioned that this operation has been added to `ops` once and a second time if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0. Additionally, the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` is also part of `ops`. Therefore, after executing the given code, `ops` will contain `[r + 1, l + 1]` twice and `[r + 1, r + 1]`.
