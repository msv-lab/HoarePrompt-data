The code snippet updates the value of `sm` by recalculating it with the new formula `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. The values of `over_sum`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged unless `sm` exceeds `over_sum`. The indices `i` and `j` are not modified by this snippet.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(lst)`**.
