### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided code and function summaries in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by performing operations where we choose a subarray and set all its elements to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray. The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. The maximum sum should be achieved, and we need to provide the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function attempts to find the best subarray `[i, j]` to perform the operation on, trying to maximize the sum of the array after the operation.
   - The function computes the sum if the subarray `[i, j]` is set to `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. The MEX value should be used instead of the square of the length of the subarray.
   - Therefore, this function is flawed because it does not compute the MEX value correctly and instead uses a heuristic that is not guaranteed to maximize the sum.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is recursive and seems to be adding operations to the list `ops` in a way that is not clearly justified by the problem requirements.
   - The logic within this function does not seem to align with the problem's goal of maximizing the sum by using the MEX value.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function performs the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` by setting all elements to `n` (the length of the subarray), which is incorrect. It should set all elements to the MEX value of the subarray.
   - It also adds operations to the list `ops` in a manner that is not clearly justified and does not align with the problem's goal.

#### Function Summary Validation:
- **Function `func_3` Summary:** The summary states that the function modifies the list `lst` by replacing the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with `n` elements, each equal to `n`, where `n` is the length of the sublist from `r` to `l`. It also records operations in the list `ops`. This summary is accurate based on the code but does not align with the problem's requirement to use the MEX value.

#### Conclusion:
- The provided code does not correctly compute the MEX value for subarrays.
- The operations performed do not align with the problem's goal of maximizing the sum by using the MEX value.
- The logic within the functions is flawed and does not guarantee that the maximum sum will be achieved.

Given the analysis above, the code is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
