The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the `last` list. Given the initial state, `last` was `[-1]`. After the code execution, `last` will be `[-1, i]`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`. `left` is a list with a single element `[0]`. `last` is a list with two elements `[-1, i]`. `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`. Additionally, `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`.**
