The value of `x` is recalculated using the expression `left[i] - a[i] - 1`. Given that `i` is 5, the new value of `x` is `left[5] - a[5] - 1`.

Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 4, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`; otherwise, `ans` at index `i` remains `i + 1 - inx`, `ans[4]` is `5 - inx`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[5] - a[5] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[3]`, `i` is 5.**
