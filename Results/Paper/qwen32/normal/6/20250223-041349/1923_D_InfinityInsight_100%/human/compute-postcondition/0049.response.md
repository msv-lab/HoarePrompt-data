The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables directly. Therefore, none of the variables `a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, `last`, `x`, `inx2`, or `i` will be changed by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 4, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`; otherwise, `ans` at index `i` remains `i + 1 - inx`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[4] - a[4] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[3]`, `i` is 4. If `inx2 < inx`, then `inx` is updated to `last[3]`.**
