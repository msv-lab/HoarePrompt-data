Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans` at index `i` remains unchanged, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`**

In natural language: The variable `inx` is now assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `left` and `x`. All other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, and `last`) remain unchanged.
