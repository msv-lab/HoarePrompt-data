Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`. `left` is a list with a single element `[0]`. `last` is a list with a single element `[-1]`. `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`.**

In natural language: The variable `ans` has been initialized as a list of `-1` with a length equal to `n`. All other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, and `last`) remain unchanged.
