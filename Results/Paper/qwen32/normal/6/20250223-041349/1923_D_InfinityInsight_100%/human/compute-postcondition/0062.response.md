Postcondition: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 4, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`; otherwise, `ans` at index `i` remains `i + 1 - inx`, `ans[4]` is `5 - inx`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[5] - a[5] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[4]`, `i` is 5. If `inx < 0`, the loop proceeds to the next iteration. If `inx >= 0`, `inx` retains its original value returned by `func_1(left, x)` and the loop proceeds to the next iteration.**
