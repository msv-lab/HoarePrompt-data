The value of `x` is calculated as `left[i] - a[i] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and conditions. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans` at index `i` remains unchanged, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.**
