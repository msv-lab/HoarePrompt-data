Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so `count` becomes 3. All other variables retain their initial values.
