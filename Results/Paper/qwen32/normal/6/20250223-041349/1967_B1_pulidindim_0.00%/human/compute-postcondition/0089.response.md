Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is at least 4, `count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / count`, and `ans` is `n + 2 * (g / count + 1)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
