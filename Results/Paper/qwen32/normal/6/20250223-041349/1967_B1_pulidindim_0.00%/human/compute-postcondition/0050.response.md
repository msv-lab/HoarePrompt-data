Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, and `g` is `n / 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
