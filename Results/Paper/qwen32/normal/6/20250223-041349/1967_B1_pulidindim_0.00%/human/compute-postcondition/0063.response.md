To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(ans))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the formula for `ans`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `count` is set to `count_final`.
- `countmins` is set to `count_final - 1`.
- `g` is calculated as `n / count_final - count_final + 1`.
- `ans` is calculated as `n + Σ (from k=2 to count_final) ((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1)`.

### Analysis:
The primary variable of interest here is `ans`, which is computed as:

\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{k=2}^{\text{count\_final}} \left( \frac{\left(\frac{n}{k} - (k - 1)\right)}{k} + 1 \right) \]

Let's break down the components:
1. **`n`**: This is the first integer input.
2. **`count_final`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the context, it seems to be a function of `n` and `m` or another derived value. Without an explicit definition, we will consider it as a given final count.
3. **`Σ (from k=2 to count_final) ((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1)`**: This is a summation that involves iterating from `k=2` to `count_final` and performing the operation inside the summation for each `k`.

Since `count_final` is not explicitly defined, we'll assume it is a known value derived from `n` and `m` based on the context of the problem. For the sake of explanation, let's assume `count_final` is some integer value `c`.

### Calculation:
Let's assume `count_final` is `c`. Then the summation part can be expanded as:

\[ \sum_{k=2}^{c} \left( \frac{\left(\frac{n}{k} - (k - 1)\right)}{k} + 1 \right) \]

Each term inside the summation can be calculated as:

\[ \text{term}_k = \frac{\left(\frac{n}{k} - (k - 1)\right)}{k} + 1 \]

Finally, `ans` is:

\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{k=2}^{c} \text{term}_k \]

### Output:
The final output will be the integer value of `ans`:

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as n + Σ (from k=2 to count_final) ((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1))**
