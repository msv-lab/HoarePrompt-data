The value of `g` is updated to `n / count`. The previous values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / 4`, and `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to its previous value.
