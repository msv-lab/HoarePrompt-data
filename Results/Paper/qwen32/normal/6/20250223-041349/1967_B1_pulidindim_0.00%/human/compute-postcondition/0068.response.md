To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition. The loop condition is `count <= m`, so we need to ensure that `count` is less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the first integer from the new input
- `m` is the second integer from the new input
- `count` is 2
- `countmins` is count_final - 1
- `g` is n / count_final - count_final + 1
- `ans` is n

The only variables relevant to the loop condition are `count` and `m`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need `count` to be less than or equal to `m`. Given that `count` is currently 2, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `m` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `countmins` is count_final - 1, `g` is n / count_final - count_final + 1, and `ans` is n**
