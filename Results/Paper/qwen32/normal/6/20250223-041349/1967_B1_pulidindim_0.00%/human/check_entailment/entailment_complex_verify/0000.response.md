### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine if the program correctly implements the solution.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve the problem using a loop that iterates over possible values of \(b\) (referred to as `count` in the code) and performs calculations involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). However, the logic used in the program does not directly address the problem's requirement to check each pair \((a, b)\) to see if it satisfies the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the program's logic:
1. Initialize `count = 2` and `ans = n`.
2. Loop while `count <= m`:
   - Calculate `countmins = count - 1`.
   - Calculate `g = n / count`.
   - If `g < countmins`, break the loop.
   - Otherwise, update `ans` by adding `g / count + 1` to it.
   - Increment `count`.

The program does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it performs some calculations that do not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

#### Counterexample:
Let's consider the provided counterexample:
- Input: `10 8`
- Expected Output: `14`
- Valid pairs: \((1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)\)

The program's logic does not correctly identify these pairs. Instead, it uses a different approach that does not ensure the correct count of valid pairs.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the counterexample, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
