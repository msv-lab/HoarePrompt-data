The code `ans += g / count + 1` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `g / count + 1` to it.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged).
- `i` is 2 (unchanged).
- `n` is the first integer from the new input (unchanged).
- `m` is at least 2 (unchanged).
- `count` is 2 (unchanged).
- `countmins` is 1 (unchanged).
- `g` is `n / 2 - 1` (unchanged).
- `ans` is `n` (changed).

The new value of `ans` will be `n + (g / count + 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2 - 1`, `ans` is `n + (g / count + 1)`**.
