Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. The program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. However, it does not correctly account for all valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

2. The loop iterates over possible values of `b` (stored in `count`), but the logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically:
   - `g = n / count` does not correctly calculate the number of valid `a` values for a given `b`.
   - The condition `if g < countmins` and the subsequent operations do not correctly determine the number of valid pairs.
   - The expression `ans += g / count + 1` is incorrect for accumulating the count of valid pairs.

3. The program does not correctly handle the gcd calculation or the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed, such as iterating over all possible values of `b` and then for each `b`, finding all valid `a` values that satisfy the given condition. This involves correctly computing the gcd and checking the divisibility condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

However, note that this brute-force approach may not be efficient enough for the given constraints (up to 10^4 test cases with `n` and `m` up to 2 * 10^6). An optimized approach is necessary to handle the large input sizes efficiently.
