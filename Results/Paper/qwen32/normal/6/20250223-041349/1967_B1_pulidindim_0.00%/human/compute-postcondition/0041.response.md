Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is `n / count`. The current value of `g` is less than `countmins`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
