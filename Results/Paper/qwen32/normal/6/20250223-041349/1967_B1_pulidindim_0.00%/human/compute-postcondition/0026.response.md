Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 4, `count` is less than `m`, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + ((n / 3 - 2) / 3 + 1)`, `countmins` is `count - 1`, and `g` is `n / count`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
