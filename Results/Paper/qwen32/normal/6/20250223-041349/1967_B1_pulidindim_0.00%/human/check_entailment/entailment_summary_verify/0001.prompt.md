You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on a specific computation involving `n` and `m`. The result is an integer value derived from the iterative process described in the code.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The third condition can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

### Simplifying the Condition:
Let's denote \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot x\) and \(b = d \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[ d \cdot x + d \cdot y = k \cdot d \cdot y \cdot x \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot x \cdot y \]
\[ k = \frac{x + y}{x \cdot y} \]

For \(k\) to be an integer, \(x + y\) must be divisible by \(x \cdot y\). This implies:
\[ x = 1 \text{ or } y = 1 \]
or
\[ x + y \geq x \cdot y \]

### Simplifying Further:
If \(y = 1\), then \(a + b = a + 1\) must be a multiple of \(b\). This means \(a + 1 = b \cdot k\), which is true for all \(a\) and \(b = 1\).

If \(x = 1\), then \(a = d\) and \(b = d \cdot y\). The condition becomes:
\[ 1 + y = k \cdot y \]
\[ k = \frac{1 + y}{y} \]
This is true if \(y\) divides \(1 + y\), which is always true for \(y = 1\).

### Counting Valid Pairs:
- For each \(b\), \(a\) can be any value from 1 to \(n\) if \(b = 1\).
- For each \(b > 1\), \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\) and \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided program and see if it correctly counts the number of valid pairs.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n  # Counting pairs where b = 1
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which correctly counts pairs where \(b = 1\).
2. **Loop for `count`:** The loop starts from `count = 2` and iterates up to `m`. For each `count`, it calculates `g = n / count` and checks if `g < countmins`. If true, it breaks the loop.
3. **Calculation of `g` and `ans`:** The calculation `g -= countmins` and `ans += g / count + 1` does not correctly account for the number of valid pairs for each `b`.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs for \(b > 1\). It incorrectly assumes that `g` and the subsequent calculations will give the correct number of valid pairs, which is not the case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
