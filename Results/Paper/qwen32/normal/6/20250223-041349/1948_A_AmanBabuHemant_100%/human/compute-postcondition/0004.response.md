The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the values of `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not dependent on the values of `t` or `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is described as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
2. The variable `n` is described as an input integer and is specified to be odd.
3. The `print` statement outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference `t` or `n`, the values of these variables do not influence the output.

Output: **NO**
