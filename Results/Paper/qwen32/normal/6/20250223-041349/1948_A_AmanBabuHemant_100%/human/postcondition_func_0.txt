The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it checks if `n` is odd, in which case it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.
