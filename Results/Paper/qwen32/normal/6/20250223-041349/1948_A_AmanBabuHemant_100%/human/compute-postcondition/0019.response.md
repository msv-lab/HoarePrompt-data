To determine the output, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the value of the variable `s` before the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 49\). This implies \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` is the input integer. The exact value of `n` is not specified, so we'll consider it as a variable.
- `s` is the string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The `//` operator denotes integer division, which means it will divide `n` by 2 and take the floor of the result.

### Value of `s`:
The string `s` is constructed by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times. For example:
- If `n` is 2, `s` will be 'AAB'.
- If `n` is 4, `s` will be 'AABAAB'.
- If `n` is 5, `s` will still be 'AABAAB' because `5 // 2` is 2.

### Print Statement:
The `print(s)` statement will output the value of `s` which is the string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact string `s`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **'AAB' repeated (n // 2) times**
