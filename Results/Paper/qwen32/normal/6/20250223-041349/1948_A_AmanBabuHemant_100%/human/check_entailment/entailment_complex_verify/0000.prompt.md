You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that `t` equals 0; no further changes are made to `t` or `n` after all iterations are complete. For each of the initial `t` test cases, if `n` is odd, the output is 'NO'. If `n` is even and the length of the string `s` (formed by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times) is less than 200, the output is 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If `n` is even and the length of `s` is 200 or more, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it checks if `n` is odd, in which case it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the program incorrectly states that it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string, which is not true.

For example, consider the case where `n = 1`. According to the problem description, we need a string with exactly 1 special character. The string "AA" has exactly 1 special character (the 'A' at position 1 is special because it is equal to its right neighbor). Therefore, the output for `n = 1` should be:

```
YES
AA
```

However, the program will output "NO" for `n = 1` because it checks if `n` is odd and immediately concludes that no suitable string exists in that case.

To fix the program, we need to handle both even and odd values of `n` correctly. For odd `n`, we can construct a string like "AA" repeated `(n-1)//2` times followed by "A", which will have exactly `n` special characters. For even `n`, the current approach of repeating "AAB" is correct.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AA')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if n % 2 == 1:
                s += 'A'
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

```

This corrected program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly and ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters in the resulting string.
