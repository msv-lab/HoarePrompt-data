Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that `0 <= t-1 <= 49`. This can be rewritten as `1 <= t <= 50`.
2. `n` is the input integer.
3. `s` is the string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This means that `s` is constructed by taking the string 'AAB' and repeating it `n // 2` times.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('YES')`. This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is explicitly printing the string 'YES', and there are no variables or conditions that alter this output based on the given initial state, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
