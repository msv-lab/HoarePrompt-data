Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` equals 0; no further changes are made to `t` or `n` after all iterations are complete. For each of the initial `t` test cases, if `n` is odd, the output is 'NO'. If `n` is even and the length of the string `s` (formed by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times) is less than 200, the output is 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If `n` is even and the length of `s` is 200 or more, the output is 'NO'.**

In simpler terms: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. For each test case, if `n` was odd, it printed 'NO'. If `n` was even, it checked the length of the string `s` formed by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` was less than 200, it printed 'YES' followed by `s`; otherwise, it printed 'NO'. The variable `t` is now 0, indicating no more iterations are left.
