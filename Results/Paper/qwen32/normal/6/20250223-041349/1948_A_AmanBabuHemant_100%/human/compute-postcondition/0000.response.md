`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50 is still valid after the code has been executed. The value of `n` for each of the `t` test cases remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.**
