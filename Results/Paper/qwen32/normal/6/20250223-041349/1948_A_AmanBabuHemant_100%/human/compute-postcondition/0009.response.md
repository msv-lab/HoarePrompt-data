To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` is an input integer and `n` is even.
- `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is less than 200.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `n // 2`**:
   - Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, then `n // 2 = 2`.
   - If `n = 6`, then `n // 2 = 3`.
   - Therefore, `n // 2` will be an integer that represents how many times the string `'AAB'` is repeated to form `s`.

2. **Construct the string `s`**:
   - `s` is formed by repeating the string `'AAB'` for `n // 2` times.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, then `s = 'AAB' * 2 = 'AABAAB'`.
   - If `n = 6`, then `s = 'AAB' * 3 = 'AABAABAAB'`.

3. **Print the string `s`**:
   - The `print(s)` statement will output the constructed string `s`.

### Conclusion:
The string `s` is constructed by repeating the substring `'AAB'` for `n // 2` times. The exact string `s` depends on the value of `n`, but it will always be a sequence of `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.

### Final Output:
Output: **'AAB' repeated n // 2 times (where n is an even integer input)**
