The code snippet `s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)` creates a new string `s` by repeating the substring `'AAB'` a number of times equal to the integer division of `n` by 2. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-2 <= 49, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a string consisting of the substring 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.**
