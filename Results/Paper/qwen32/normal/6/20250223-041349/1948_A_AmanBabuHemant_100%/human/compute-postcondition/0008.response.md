The given task involves an initial state with specific conditions and variables. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.
   - `n` is an even integer.
   - `s` is a string formed by repeating `'AAB'` a total of `n // 2` times.
   - The length of `s` is guaranteed to be less than 200.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`, the output will always be `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **YES**
