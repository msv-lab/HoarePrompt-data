The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the provided Python code snippet. The code snippet only contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since there are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement that depend on the values of `t` or `n`, the output will simply be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
