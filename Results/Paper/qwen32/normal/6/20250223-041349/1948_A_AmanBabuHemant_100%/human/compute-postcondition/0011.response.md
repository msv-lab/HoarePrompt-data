Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` is an input integer and `n` is even.
- `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is 200 or more.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'` as it is specified in the code snippet.

Output: **NO**
