### Reasoning:

The problem requires generating a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The given program follows a specific strategy:
- For an odd `n`, it outputs "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters under the given definition.
- For an even `n`, it constructs a string by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' in "AAB" (except the first and last in the sequence) is a special character, and each 'B' in "AAB" is also a special character. Since "AAB" contributes 2 special characters per repetition, repeating it `n // 2` times results in exactly `n` special characters.
- The program also checks if the length of the generated string is less than 200, which is unnecessary because the maximum length of the string generated by repeating "AAB" 25 times (since `n` is at most 50) is 75, which is well within the limit of 200.

The logic in the program matches the problem requirements, and the provided example outputs are consistent with the program's behavior.
