Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` right-shifted by 1 bit (i.e., `k` is now `k // 2`); `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`; `i` is 0. If the original `k` was an odd integer, then `arr` is `[0]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.**

In natural language: The value of `k` has been halved using a right shift operation. All other variables remain unchanged. If `k` was initially odd, `arr` is `[0]`; otherwise, it is still an empty list.
