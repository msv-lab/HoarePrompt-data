The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 2, so the new value of `i` is 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that `0 <= t-1 <= 10^4`; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 3; `arr` is [1]; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.
