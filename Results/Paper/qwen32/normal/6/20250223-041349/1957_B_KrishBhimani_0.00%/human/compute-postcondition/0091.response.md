The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1` left-shifted by `i` bits to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, `1 << 2` equals 4. Therefore, 4 is appended to the list `ans`.

The initial state specifies that if `c` equals `n - 1`, then `ans` is either `[8, 8, -16]` or `[0, 8, 8, -16]` and we break out of the loop. However, the problem statement does not provide any condition that would make `c` equal to `n - 1` given the initial values. Therefore, we assume that `c` does not equal `n - 1`, and `ans` initially is either `[8, 8]` or `[0, 8, 8]`.

After appending 4 to `ans`, if `ans` was initially `[8, 8]`, it becomes `[8, 8, 4]`. If `ans` was initially `[0, 8, 8]`, it becomes `[0, 8, 8, 4]`.

The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 2; `arr` is [2, 3]; `c` is `n + 2`; `ans` is either [8, 8, 4] or [0, 8, 8, 4]**.
