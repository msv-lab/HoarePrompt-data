Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is the last value from `arr` (which could be 2 or 3 depending on the exact number of iterations); `arr` is [2, 3]; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l1 = input().split()` updates `l1` to be a list of substrings split from the new input string on whitespace. All other variables remain unchanged.
