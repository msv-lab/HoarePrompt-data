Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`. It generates a list `ans` of `n` elements where the sum of the elements equals `k`. The list is constructed using powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `k`, and the remaining elements are zeros, with the last element adjusted to ensure the sum equals `k`. The function outputs this list for each test case.**
