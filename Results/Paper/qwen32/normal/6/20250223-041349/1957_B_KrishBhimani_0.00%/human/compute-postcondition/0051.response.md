The code snippet provided is simply `arr = []`. This line reassigns `arr` to an empty list. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `k0` is 0; `i` is 0; `arr` is []; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0**.
