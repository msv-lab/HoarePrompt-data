You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1

        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:

                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The output state after all iterations is a series of lists `ans` for each test case, where each `ans` is constructed based on the binary decomposition of `k` and adjusted to sum to `k`. Each `ans` list will have `n` elements, with the first `len(arr)` elements being powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of set bits in `k`, and the remaining elements being zeros, with the last element adjusted to ensure the sum equals `k`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding:
1. We need to create a sequence of `n` non-negative integers whose sum is `k`.
2. Among all possible sequences, we need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all integers in the sequence.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Bitwise OR Maximization:**
   - The program aims to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. To do this, it tries to set as many bits as possible in the binary representation of the numbers in the sequence.
   - It does this by identifying the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `k` and using those positions to set bits in the sequence.

3. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - It creates an array `arr` that contains the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then constructs the sequence `ans` by setting the bits at the positions stored in `arr` to 1, except for the last element which is adjusted to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
   - If there are still positions left in the sequence, it fills them with 0s.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Construction of the Sequence:**
  - The program sets bits based on the positions of 1s in `k` but does not ensure that the sum of the sequence equals `k`. It only sets the bits at the positions of 1s in `k` and fills the rest with 0s.
  - This approach does not guarantee that the sum of the sequence will be `k` and does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR in all cases.

- **Example of Failure:**
  - Consider the test case `n = 2, k = 5`. The binary representation of 5 is `101`. The program would set the bits at positions 0 and 2, resulting in the sequence `[1, 4]`. However, this sequence has a bitwise OR of `101` (3 in decimal), which is not optimal. A better sequence would be `[1, 4]` or `[3, 2]` because `3 | 2 = 111` (7 in decimal) has more 1s in its binary representation.

### Correct Approach:
- A correct approach would be to distribute the value `k` among the `n` numbers in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. One possible strategy is to use the smallest powers of 2 to make up `k` while ensuring that the sequence has `n` numbers.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
