The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; l1 is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; n is the integer value of the first element of the new l1; k is 0; k0 is the integer value of k; i is 3; arr is [2]; ans is []; c is 0.**
