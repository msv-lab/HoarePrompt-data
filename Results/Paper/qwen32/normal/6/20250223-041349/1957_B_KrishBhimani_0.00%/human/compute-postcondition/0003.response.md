Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variables `t`, `l1`, `n`, and `k` retain their initial values as specified. A new variable `arr` is introduced and initialized as an empty list.
