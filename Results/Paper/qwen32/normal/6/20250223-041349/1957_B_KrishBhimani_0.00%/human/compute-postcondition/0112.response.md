The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, which means the loop will not execute again. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to set `k` to a non-zero value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 1; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [1]; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.**
