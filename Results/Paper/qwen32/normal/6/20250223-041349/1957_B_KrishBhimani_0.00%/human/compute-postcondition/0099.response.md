The code snippet `k0 = k` assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. Given that `k0` already holds the value of `k` from the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `k0`. Therefore, the values of `k` and `k0` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is the last value from `arr` (which could be 2 or 3 depending on the exact number of iterations); `arr` is []; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.**
