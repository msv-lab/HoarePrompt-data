The code appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `k0` is 0, and `ans` is either `[8]` or `[0, 8]`.

1. If `ans` is `[8]`, then `sum(ans)` is `8`, and `k0 - sum(ans)` is `0 - 8`, which equals `-8`. So, `ans` becomes `[8, -8]`.
2. If `ans` is `[0, 8]`, then `sum(ans)` is `0 + 8`, which equals `8`, and `k0 - sum(ans)` is `0 - 8`, which equals `-8`. So, `ans` becomes `[0, 8, -8]`.

The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is `n`, which also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 3; `arr` is [2, 3]; `ans` is either [8, -8] or [0, 8, -8]; `c` is `n`**.
