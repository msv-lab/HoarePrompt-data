The given code snippet shifts the value of `k` to the right by 1 bit, effectively performing integer division by 2. Given that `k` is initially 1, after the right shift, `k` becomes 0.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4.
- `l1` remains a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace.
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is now 0.
- `k0` remains the integer value of `k` before the shift, which is 1.
- `i` remains 1.
- `arr` remains [1] if `k` (before the shift) is odd, otherwise `arr` is [1]. Since `k0` is 1 (odd), `arr` is [1].
- `ans` remains [8, 8, 4, -20].
- `c` remains `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 1; `arr` is [1]; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.**
