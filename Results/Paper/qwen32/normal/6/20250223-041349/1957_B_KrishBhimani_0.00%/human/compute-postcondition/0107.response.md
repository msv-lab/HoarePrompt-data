The `while` loop in the given code is controlled by the variable `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `k` must be truthy (i.e., `k` must be a non-zero integer).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` divided by 2
- `k0` is the integer value of `k` before the shift
- `i` is 1
- `arr` is [0] if `k` (before the shift) is odd, otherwise `arr` is []
- `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]
- `c` is `n`

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `k` is non-zero. Since `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` divided by 2, we need to ensure that the integer value of the second element of `l1` is non-zero and even (so that after dividing by 2, `k` remains non-zero).

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`k` in this case), we can directly adjust `k` to be a non-zero value. The simplest way to ensure this is to set `k` to 1 (or any other positive integer).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 1; `k0` is the integer value of `k` before the shift; `i` is 1; `arr` is [0] if `k` (before the shift) is odd, otherwise `arr` is []; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`**
