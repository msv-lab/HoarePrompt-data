Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are the integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `y` is an odd number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been calculated as `y // 2 + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
