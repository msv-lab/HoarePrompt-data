The code snippet `space_x = x * 1` updates the value of `space_x` to be equal to `x`. This means `space_x` will now hold the value of `x` directly.

The other variables (`t`, `y`, `n`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`, and `result`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, the new value of `space_x` is simply `x`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y]`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is divisible by 15, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.**
