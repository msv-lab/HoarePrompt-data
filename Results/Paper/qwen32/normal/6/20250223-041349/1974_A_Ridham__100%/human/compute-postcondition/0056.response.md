To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how the `result` list accumulates the results for each iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if extra_space % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
```

Each iteration of the loop processes one set of `x` and `y` values, calculates the required number of screens, and appends the result to the `result` list.

The final output state after all `n` iterations would be the `result` list containing the screen requirements for each of the `n` test cases.

### Output State

Output State: **the `result` list after processing all `n` test cases.**

### Natural Language Description

After the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the `result` list will contain `n` elements, where each element represents the number of screens required to accommodate the 1x1 and 2x2 application icons for each respective test case. The final state of the `result` list is the accumulated output of all the individual computations done in each iteration of the loop.
