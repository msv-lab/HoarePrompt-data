Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `result` is a list containing one element `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y]`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`. `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`. If `extra_space` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**

The `result` list now contains one element, which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables retain their initial values or calculated values as per the initial state description.
