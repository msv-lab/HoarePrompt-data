To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects present in the loop head. In the given for loop:

```
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `n`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. The underscore `_` is a convention for a variable that we do not intend to use within the loop body. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The other variables `t`, `x`, `y`, and `result` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively.
- `n` is an integer that determines the number of iterations.
- `result` is an empty list.

The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `result` is an empty list**
