You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. It calculates and returns the minimum number of screens required to accommodate all the icons for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Program Analysis

The program attempts to determine the minimum number of screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid (15 cells).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is calculated as the total space required for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y` is calculated as the total space required for 2x2 icons.
3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - If `y` is even, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `y // 2 + 1`.
4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons are calculated.
   - If the remaining cells are enough to place all 1x1 icons, the total screens required are the screens used for 2x2 icons.
   - If not, the program calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons.
5. **Output**: The program outputs the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Potential Issues

Let's consider the following edge cases to verify the correctness:

1. **Case 1: No Icons**
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Program Output: `0`
   - **Correct**

2. **Case 2: Only 1x1 Icons**
   - `x = 15`, `y = 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1`
   - **Correct**

3. **Case 3: Only 2x2 Icons**
   - `x = 0`, `y = 4`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2`
   - **Correct**

4. **Case 4: Mixed Icons**
   - `x = 7`, `y = 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1`
   - **Correct**

5. **Case 5: Maximum 2x2 Icons**
   - `x = 0`, `y = 99`
   - Expected Output: `50` (since 99 // 2 + 1 = 50)
   - Program Output: `50`
   - **Correct**

6. **Case 6: Mixed Icons with Remaining 1x1 Icons**
   - `x = 13`, `y = 2`
   - Expected Output: `2` (2 screens for 2x2 icons, 1 screen for remaining 1x1 icons)
   - Program Output: `2`
   - **Correct**

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program with various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for placing the icons as per the problem description. There are no apparent issues or edge cases where the program fails to provide the correct output.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation

The program correctly handles the calculation of screens required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons. It considers the exact number of screens needed for 2x2 icons and then calculates if the remaining cells are sufficient for 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates additional screens required for 1x1 icons. The program passes all the test cases and edge cases considered, ensuring its correctness.
