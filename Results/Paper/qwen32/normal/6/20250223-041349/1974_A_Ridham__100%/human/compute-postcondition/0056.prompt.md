Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively; `n` is an input integer; `result` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if extra_space % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y]`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is divisible by 15, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the values `[screen_require_for_y, screen_require_for_y]`. Otherwise, if `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is divisible by 15, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise, and `result` is a list containing the values `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y, screen_require_for_y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the values `[screen_require_for_y, screen_require_for_y, screen_require_for_y]`. If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is divisible by 15, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise, and `result` is a list containing the values `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y, screen_require_for_y, extra_screen + screen_require_for_y]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
