The code snippet `space_x = x * 1` simply assigns the value of `x` to `space_x` since multiplying by 1 does not change the value. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are the integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`.**
