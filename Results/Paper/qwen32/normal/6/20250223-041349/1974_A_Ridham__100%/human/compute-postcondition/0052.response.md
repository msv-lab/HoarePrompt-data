The code snippet provided modifies the value of `extra_screen` by setting it to `extra_space // 15 + 1`. This calculation ensures that `extra_screen` is always rounded up to the nearest whole number, even if `extra_space` is not perfectly divisible by 15.

Given the initial state, the value of `extra_screen` is recalculated using the provided formula. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this single line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`, and `result` is a list containing the values `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y, screen_require_for_y]`.**
