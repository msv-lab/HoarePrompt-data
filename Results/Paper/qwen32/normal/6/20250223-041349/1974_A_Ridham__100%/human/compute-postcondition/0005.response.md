Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are the integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**

Explanation: The value of `space_y` is updated to be `y * 4`. All other variables retain their initial values as no other assignments or operations were performed on them.
