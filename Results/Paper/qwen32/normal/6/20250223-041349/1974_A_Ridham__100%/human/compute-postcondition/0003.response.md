The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, but these values are overwritten by the input. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `result` is still an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are the integers read from input (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `result` is an empty list**.
