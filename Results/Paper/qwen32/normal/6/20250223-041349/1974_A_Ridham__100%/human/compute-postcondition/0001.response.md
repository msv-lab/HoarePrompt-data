The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `result`. The other variables `t`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are mentioned in the initial state but not modified by the given code snippet. Therefore, their values remain unchanged. 

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively; `n` is an input integer; `result` is an empty list.**
