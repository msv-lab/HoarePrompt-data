You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
    if i > j:
        return 0
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
    if j != len(arr) - 1:
        return j - i + 1
    return j - i



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns 0 if the entire list is a palindrome, 1 if the list has a single mismatch at the end, and 2 if there is a mismatch that is not at the end.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Burles**:
   - The code attempts to find the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are the same and then calculates the burles required to make the middle section uniform. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum burles required in all cases.
   - The code does not consider the possibility of making the entire array equal to a single element by applying the operation optimally.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the array has repeating elements in the middle that could be used to minimize the burles.
   - The code does not handle cases where the array has a single element, which should return 0 burles.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Burles**:
   - The calculation of burles in the code (`return j - i + 1`) is not always correct. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the code might return 4, but the correct answer is 4 (changing the middle elements to 1 or any other element).

### Counterexample:
Consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The code will return 4, but the correct answer is 4 (changing the middle elements to 1 or any other element). However, a more illustrative counterexample is:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, the optimal operation is to change the middle element to 1, which requires 2 burles (changing the array to `[1, 2, 1, 1, 1]` and then to `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`).

Given these issues, the code is not correct for all potential cases.
