Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \), and the length of `arr`, `n`, satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \). Additionally, there are `t` test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^5 \). `i` is 0; `j` is `len(arr) - 1`. The first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
