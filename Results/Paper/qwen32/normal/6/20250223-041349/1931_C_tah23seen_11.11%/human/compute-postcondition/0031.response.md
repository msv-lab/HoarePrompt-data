Given the initial state, `i` is the index where the first mismatch occurs, and `j` is `i + 1`. Since `j` is not equal to the last index of `arr`, we can infer that there is at least one more element in the list after the mismatch.

The code `return j - i + 1` calculates the difference between `j` and `i`, and then adds 1. Since `j` is `i + 1`, the difference `j - i` is 1. Adding 1 to this difference results in 2.

Output State: **The program returns 2**.
