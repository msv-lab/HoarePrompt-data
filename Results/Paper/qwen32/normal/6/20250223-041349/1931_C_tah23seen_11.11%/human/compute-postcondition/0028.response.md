Output State: **`arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`; `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`; `arr[i + 2]` is equal to `arr[i + 3]`; `i` is increased by 3.**

In the output state, the values of the array elements `arr[i]`, `arr[i + 1]`, and `arr[i + 2]` remain the same as described in the initial state. The variable `i` is increased by 3, reflecting the increment of 1 from the given code and the additional 2 from the initial state.
