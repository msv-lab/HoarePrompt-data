The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the loop or block it is contained within, but since there is no loop or block shown in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, none of the variables (`arr`, `n`, `t`, `i`, `j`) are altered.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \), and the length of `arr`, `n`, satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \). Additionally, there are `t` test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^5 \). If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`. `i` must still be less than or equal to `j`. If `i` is greater than `j`, adjust `i` to be equal to `j`.**
