Given the initial state, `i` is the index where the first mismatch occurs, and `j` is `i + 1`. Additionally, `j` is also equal to `len(arr) - 1`. From this, we can deduce that `i + 1` equals `len(arr) - 1`, which means `i` must be equal to `len(arr) - 2`.

Therefore, the expression `j - i` simplifies to `(len(arr) - 1) - (len(arr) - 2)`, which equals `1`.

Output State: **The program returns 1**.
