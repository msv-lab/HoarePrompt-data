You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, and the length of arr, n, satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, there are t test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The loop terminates with `i` and `j` such that `i` is either equal to `j` or `i` is greater than `j`. If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]` for all iterations up to the point of termination, then `i` and `j` will be equal, pointing to the middle element if the array length is odd, or to the point just beyond the middle if the array length is even. If at any point `arr[i]` was not equal to `arr[j]`, the loop breaks, and `i` and `j` will be the indices where the elements first differ.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: The loop terminates with `i` and `j` such that `i` is equal to `j`. If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]` for all iterations up to the point of termination, then `i` and `j` will be equal, pointing to the middle element if the array length is odd, or to the point just beyond the middle if the array length is even. If at any point `arr[i]` was not equal to `arr[j]`, the loop breaks, and `i` and `j` will be the indices where the elements first differ. Additionally, `i` is not greater than `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the index where the first mismatch occurs, and `j` is `i + 1`.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns 2
    #State: `i` is the index where the first mismatch occurs, and `j` is `i + 1`. `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
    return j - i
    #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= n, and the length of `arr`, n, satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Depending on the contents of `arr`, the function returns 0 in Case_1, 2 in Case_2, and 1 in Case_3.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns 2

Case_3: The program returns 1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
