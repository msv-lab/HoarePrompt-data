Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. The algorithm attempts to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by only considering the possibility of setting a segment from the start and the end of the array to the same value. However, this approach is insufficient because the optimal solution might involve setting a segment that is not at the boundaries of the array.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The program will output `2`, but the correct answer is `1`. The optimal operation is to set the segment `[1, 2]` to `3` (or vice versa), which costs `2 - 1 + 1 = 2` burles. However, setting the segment `[2]` to `1` or `3` costs only `1` burle, which is the minimum.

The program needs to consider all possible segments and their costs, not just the segments at the boundaries. A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a more sophisticated greedy algorithm to find the minimum cost for all possible segments.
