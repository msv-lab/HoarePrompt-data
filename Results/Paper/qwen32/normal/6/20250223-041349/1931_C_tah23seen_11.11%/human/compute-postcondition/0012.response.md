The provided Python code snippet contains a single statement: `break`. This statement is used to exit the nearest enclosing loop (such as a `for` or `while` loop). However, since there is no loop present in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the execution of the program. Therefore, the values of the variables and the conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \), and the length of `arr`, `n`, satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \). Additionally, there are `t` test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^5 \). If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is `len(arr) - 2`. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`. `i` must be less than or equal to `j`. The `break` statement has no effect on the execution as there is no enclosing loop.**
