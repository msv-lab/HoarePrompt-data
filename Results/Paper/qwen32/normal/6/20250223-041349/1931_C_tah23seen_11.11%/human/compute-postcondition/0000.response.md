Output State: **arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, and the length of arr, n, satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, there are t test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `i` is 0.**

In simple terms, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `i` is now set to 0. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
