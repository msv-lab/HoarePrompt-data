To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop increments `i` as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This means the loop will terminate when it encounters the first pair of elements in the array where the elements are not equal.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` and `i` is increased by 1.
- After 2 iterations: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`, `arr[i + 1] == arr[i + 2]`, and `i` is increased by 2.
- After 3 iterations: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`, `arr[i + 1] == arr[i + 2]`, `arr[i + 2] == arr[i + 3]`, and `i` is increased by 3.

The loop will continue to execute as long as `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. Therefore, the loop will terminate when `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` for the first time. At that point, `i` will point to the last index where the elements were equal.

The final output state will be:
- `i` will be the index where the first mismatch occurs.
- `j` will be `i + 1` (since the loop condition checks `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`).
- The values of other variables not affected by the loop will remain unchanged.

Thus, the final output state in the required format is:

Output State: **`i` is the index where the first mismatch occurs, and `j` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, `i` will be the index of the last element in a sequence of equal elements, and `j` will be the index of the first different element that breaks the sequence.
