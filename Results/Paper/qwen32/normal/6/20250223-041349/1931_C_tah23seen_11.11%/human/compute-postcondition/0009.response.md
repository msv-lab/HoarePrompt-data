To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `i <= j` is satisfied. The variables `i` and `j` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

Given the problem statement:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `i` and `j` are indices used in the loop.
- The loop condition is `while i <= j`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `j`. Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Initial Condition**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` and `j` are such that `i` is not greater than `j`.
2. **Adjustment**: To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `i` is still less than or equal to `j`.

Since the loop condition is `i <= j`, we need to ensure that after the previous iteration, `i` and `j` are still in a state where this condition holds true. If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `j`, then after decrementing `j` or incrementing `i` in the loop body, `i` would still be less than or equal to `j` if the loop body adjusted these indices appropriately.

However, without knowing the exact changes made to `i` and `j` inside the loop body, we can only ensure the condition holds by stating that `i` should be less than or equal to `j` at the start of the next iteration.

### Example Adjustment:
- If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3 and `j` was 3, then the loop can execute one more time as `3 <= 3`.
- If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2 and `j` was 4, then the loop can execute one more time as `2 <= 4`.
- If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4 and `j` was 3, then the loop would not execute again as `4 > 3`. However, to ensure it does, we need to adjust `i` or `j` so that `i <= j`.

Given the problem constraints and the loop condition, we ensure that `i` and `j` are adjusted to maintain `i <= j`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \), and the length of `arr`, `n`, satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \). Additionally, there are `t` test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^5 \). If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is `len(arr) - 2`. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`. `i` must be less than or equal to `j`**.
