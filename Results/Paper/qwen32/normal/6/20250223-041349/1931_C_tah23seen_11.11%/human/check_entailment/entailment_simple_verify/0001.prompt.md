You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to make all elements of an array equal by applying at most one operation that sets a subarray to a specific value. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray. We need to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Function `func_1(arr)`:**
   - The function aims to determine the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.
   - It initializes two pointers, `i` at the start and `j` at the end of the array.
   - It moves these pointers towards the center as long as the elements at these positions are equal.
   - If `i` surpasses `j`, it means the array is already uniform, and the function returns `0`.
   - It then moves `i` further to the right as long as the elements are equal.
   - If `j` is not at the end of the array, it returns `j - i + 1` as the cost, which is the length of the subarray that needs to be changed.
   - Otherwise, it returns `j - i` as the cost.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Let's consider the provided test cases and the logic of the program:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `6`, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
   - The program will return `4` because the minimal operation needed is to change `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to any single value, which costs `4` burles.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `7`, `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - The array is already uniform, so the program correctly returns `0`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `8`, `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`
   - The program will return `2` because the minimal operation needed is to change `[1, 2]` to any single value, which costs `2` burles.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `1`, `[1]`
   - The array is already uniform, so the program correctly returns `0`.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `2`, `[1, 2]`
   - The program will return `1` because the minimal operation needed is to change either `1` to `2` or `2` to `1`, which costs `1` burle.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `3`, `[1, 2, 3]`
   - The program will return `2` because the minimal operation needed is to change `[1, 2]` or `[2, 3]` to any single value, which costs `2` burles.

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `7`, `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`
   - The program will return `6` because the minimal operation needed is to change the entire array except the last element, which costs `6` burles.

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - Input: `9`, `[9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`
   - The program will return `7` because the minimal operation needed is to change the entire array except the first two elements, which costs `7` burles.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, in the case of `[1, 2, 3]`, the program returns `2`, which is correct, but in the case of `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`, the program returns `6`, which is incorrect. The correct minimal operation would be to change the array to a single value with a cost of `5` burles by changing `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1]` or `[3, 2, 7, 1, 1]` to a single value.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
