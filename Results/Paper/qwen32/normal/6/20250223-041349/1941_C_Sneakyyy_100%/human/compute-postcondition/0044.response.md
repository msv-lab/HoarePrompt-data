The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with length greater than 2; `s` is the substring of `a` from index `len(a) - 3` to `len(a)`; If the original `s` (substring from index 0 to 2) was either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is `len(a) - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is `len(a) - 2`.**
