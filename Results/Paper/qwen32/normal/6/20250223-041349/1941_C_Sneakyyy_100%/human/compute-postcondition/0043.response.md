The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is the new input string with length greater than 2
- `s` is the substring of `a` from index `len(a) - 3` to `len(a)`
- If the original `s` (substring from index 0 to 2) was either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1, otherwise `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(a)`

After the execution of `ans += 1`, `ans` will be incremented by 1. So if `ans` was 1, it will become 2, and if `ans` was 0, it will become 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with length greater than 2; `s` is the substring of `a` from index `len(a) - 3` to `len(a)`; If the original `s` (substring from index 0 to 2) was either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` is 1; `i` is `len(a)`**
