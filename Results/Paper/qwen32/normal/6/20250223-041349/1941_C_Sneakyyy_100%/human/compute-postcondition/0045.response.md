Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with length greater than 2; `s` is the substring of `a` from index `len(a) - 3` to `len(a)`. If the original `s` (substring from index 0 to 2) was either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is `len(a)` if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1 and `i` is `len(a) - 2`. If the original `s` was neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `ans` is 0 and `i` is `len(a) - 2`.**
