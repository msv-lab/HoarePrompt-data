The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Initially, `i` was either 3 or 1 based on the value of `s`. After the increment, `i` becomes 4 or 2, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than 5; `s` is `a[i:i + 3]`; If `s` was originally 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**
