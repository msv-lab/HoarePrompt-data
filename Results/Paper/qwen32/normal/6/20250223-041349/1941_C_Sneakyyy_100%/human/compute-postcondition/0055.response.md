The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means that `n` will hold the integer value provided by the user input. The precondition that `num_iterations` is the number of iterations input by the user and must be greater than the current iteration count remains unchanged.

Output State: **`num_iterations` is the number of iterations input by the user, and it must be greater than the current iteration count; `n` is an input integer.**
