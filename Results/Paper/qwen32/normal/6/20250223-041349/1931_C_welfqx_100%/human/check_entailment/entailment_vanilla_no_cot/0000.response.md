Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all given test cases. The logic used in the program is flawed as it only checks for the longest sequence of identical elements from the start and the end of the array. However, the problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one range assignment operation.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The program will output `2`, but the correct answer is `1`. This is because you can make all elements equal to `1` or `3` by changing the middle element, which costs `1` burle.

The correct approach should involve finding the most frequent element and determining the minimum cost to make the entire array equal to that element, considering the possibility of using the range assignment operation optimally.
