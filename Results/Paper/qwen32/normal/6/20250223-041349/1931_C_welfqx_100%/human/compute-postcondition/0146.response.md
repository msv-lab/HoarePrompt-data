Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer and either `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise `f` is 1, `num` is the new input list of integers, `onum` is the input list of integers, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the first element of the input list, `ck` depends on the conditions provided for `symb1` and `symb2`, and `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`.**
