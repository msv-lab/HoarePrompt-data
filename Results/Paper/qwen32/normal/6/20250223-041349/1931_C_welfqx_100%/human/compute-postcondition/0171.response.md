To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses based on the given conditions. The loop iterates over the list `num` and checks if consecutive elements are equal. It increments the counter `cn` if they are equal, otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the first three consecutive elements of the list `num` are equal. Let's summarize the key points:

1. **Initial State:** 
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is the input integer, the length of the list.
   - `f` is 1.
   - `num` is the input list of integers.
   - `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`.
   - `symb1` is the first element of the input list.
   - `symb2` is the last element of the input list.
   - `ck` is 1.
   - `r` is incremented by 1 if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`.
   - `cn` is 1 initially.

2. **After the first iteration:**
   - `cn` is 2 if `num[0] == num[1]`.

3. **After the second iteration:**
   - `cn` is 3 if `num[1] == num[2]`.

4. **After the third iteration:**
   - `cn` is 4 if `num[2] == num[3]`.

This pattern suggests that as long as consecutive elements are equal, the loop will continue to increment `cn`. The loop will break if it encounters a pair of consecutive elements that are not equal.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the first four elements of `num` are equal. The loop will continue until it finds a pair of consecutive elements that are not equal or until it has iterated `n-1` times.

To find the final output state, we need to determine the value of `cn` and the value of `i` when the loop terminates. If the loop completes all `n-1` iterations without breaking, it means all elements in the list `num` are equal. If it breaks at some point, `cn` will reflect the number of consecutive equal elements found before the break.

Let's consider the two scenarios:

1. **All elements in `num` are equal:**
   - The loop will complete all `n-1` iterations.
   - `cn` will be `n`.

2. **The loop breaks at some point:**
   - Let `k` be the index where the loop breaks (i.e., `num[k] != num[k+1]`).
   - The loop will iterate `k` times.
   - `cn` will be `k+1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact contents of `num`, we can only provide a general solution. However, based on the information provided, we can assume the worst case where all elements are equal, leading to the maximum possible value of `cn`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `f` is 1; `num` is the new input list of integers; `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`; `symb1` is the first element of the input list; `symb2` is the last element of the input list; `ck` is 1; `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`; `cn` is `n`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop completes, the counter `cn` will reflect the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list, which is the length of the list `n` if all elements are equal.
