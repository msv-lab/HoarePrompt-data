Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `onum` is now the same as the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the new `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1, `r` is `r_prev + 1` if `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `j` remains `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value of `j` when the loop breaks. If `n` is not 1 and `f` is not 1, the postcondition remains as per the initial state without any changes to `cn` or `r`. Additionally, `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
