Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f` is 1, `num` is the input list of integers, `onum` is the input list of integers, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the first element of the input list, `r` is `r_prev + 1` if `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, `j` is `n - 2` if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `j` is the value of `i` when the loop breaks, and `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements found before the loop breaks or `n` if all elements in `num` are equal. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is 2. Otherwise, `ck` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ii` is 0.**
