Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is not specified before the loop starts, and `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
