The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `num`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `f` is 1; `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
