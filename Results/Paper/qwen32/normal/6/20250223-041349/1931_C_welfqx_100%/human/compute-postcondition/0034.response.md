Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, and `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`. The loop or if statement we were directly inside is broken out of.**

In simple terms, the values of all the variables remain the same, and the loop or if statement is exited.
