The code provided simply creates a reversed copy of the list `num` and assigns it to `onum`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `onum` is a reversed copy of the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the new `num`, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of the new `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached. If `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the sum of its previous value and `ck`, `r` is `r_prev + 1`. The value of `j` remains `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value of `j` when the loop breaks. If `n` is not 1 and `f` is not 1, the postcondition remains as per the initial state without any changes to `cn` or `r`.**

In simpler terms: The list `onum` is now a reversed copy of `num`. All other variables retain their initial values.
