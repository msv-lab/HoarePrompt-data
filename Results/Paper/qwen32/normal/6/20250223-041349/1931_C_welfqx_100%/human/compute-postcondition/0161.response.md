Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is the new input list of integers, `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the last element of the input list, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`, `cn` is 1, and `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state, with the addition that we have exited the loop or if statement.
