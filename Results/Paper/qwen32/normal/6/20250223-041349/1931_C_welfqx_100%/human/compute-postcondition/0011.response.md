The code snippet provided initializes a variable `f` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `num`, `j`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `f` is 0.**
