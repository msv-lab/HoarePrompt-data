Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `f` is 1; `num` is the new input list of integers; `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`; `symb1` is the first element of the input list; `symb2` is the last element of the input list; `ck` is 1; `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`; `cn` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
        cn += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is the new input list of integers, `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the last element of the input list, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is the new input list of integers, `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the last element of the input list, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`. `i` is 4. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 5, `f` is 1, `num` is the new input list of integers, `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the last element of the input list, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`. `i` is 5. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
