The code snippet assigns the value of the first element of `onum` to `symb2`. Since `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `onum[0]` is the last element of `num`. Therefore, `symb2` will be equal to the last element of `num`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, and the condition `n == 1 or f == 1` is true; `cn` is 1; `ck` is 1; `symb2` is the last element of `num`.**
