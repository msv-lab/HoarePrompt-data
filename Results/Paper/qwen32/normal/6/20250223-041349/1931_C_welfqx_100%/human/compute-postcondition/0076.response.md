Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 0, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the new `num`, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of the new `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the sum of its previous value and `ck`, `r` is `r_prev + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`, `cn`, and `r` remain as they were before the `break` statement, except that the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
