The value of `X` is assigned the result of `A // 2`, which is the integer division of `A` by 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `B`, `C`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `X` is `A // 2`.**
