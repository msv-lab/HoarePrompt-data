To determine what will be printed by the `print(A * B)` statement, we need to understand the values of `A` and `B` based on the given initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30 (though `n`, `a`, and `b` are not used in the provided code snippet).
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input.
- The current value of `B` is such that `B * 2 < C`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(A * B)
```

Based on the initial state, `A` and `B` are integers, but their specific values are not explicitly defined in the precondition. Therefore, we can only express the output in terms of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers obtained from the input)**
