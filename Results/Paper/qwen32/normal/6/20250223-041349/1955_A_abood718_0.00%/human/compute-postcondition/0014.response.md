The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The initial state does not mention any pre-existing values for `A`, `B`, and `C`, so these values are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input. If `B * 2 < C`, then the current value of `B` is such that `B * 2 < C`. Otherwise, if `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and `A` is even, then `A` remains unchanged. If `A` is odd, then `X` is set to `A // 2`, `i` is `i + 1`. `A`, `B`, and `C` are now the integers obtained from the input.**

In natural language: The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated to the integers provided in the input. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `X`, `i`) remain unchanged unless further operations are performed on them. The conditions involving `B * 2 < C` and the parity of `A` are still valid as described in the initial state.
