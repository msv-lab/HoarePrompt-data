Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the last part of the `else` clause. Specifically, the line `print(X)` is incorrect and should be removed. The function should only print the final cost, not intermediate values. Here's the corrected version of the `else` clause:

```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    print(X * C + B)
```

This change ensures that the program correctly calculates and prints the minimum cost for each test case.
