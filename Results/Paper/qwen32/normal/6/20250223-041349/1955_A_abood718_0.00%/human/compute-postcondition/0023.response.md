The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1.**
