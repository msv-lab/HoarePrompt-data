To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze each function and how they work together to solve the problem. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a tree with `n` vertices.
   - We need to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible value of `x`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum `x`.
   - It involves defining a tree structure and several functions to traverse and evaluate the tree.

3. **Tree Structure**:
   - The `Tree` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code and is used to represent the tree structure.
   - The tree is rooted at vertex 0 (0-indexed) and the edges are added with vertices adjusted to be 0-indexed.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is assumed to root the tree at the specified vertex, setting up the tree for traversal.

4. **Functions**:
   - **`func_1` and `func_2`**: These functions perform a postorder traversal of the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
     - `func_1` uses a stack to perform an iterative postorder traversal.
     - `func_2` is a recursive version of the same logic.
   - **`func_3`**: This function checks if it is possible to have `k` good components with each having at least `x` vertices.
     - It uses `func_1` to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - It returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.
   - **`func_4`**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
     - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n`.
     - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is feasible.
     - It adjusts `beg` and `end` based on the result of `func_3`.
   - **`func_5`**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and prints the result of `func_4`.

5. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The binary search in `func_4` is correct for finding the maximum `x` because it efficiently narrows down the feasible range.
   - The traversal and calculations in `func_1` and `func_3` are correct for determining the number of good components and the remaining size.
   - The logic in `func_3` correctly checks if the conditions are met for a given `x`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 1 and `n` is 2 correctly, as demonstrated in the example.
   - It also handles cases where `k` is close to `n` and where `k` is small.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
