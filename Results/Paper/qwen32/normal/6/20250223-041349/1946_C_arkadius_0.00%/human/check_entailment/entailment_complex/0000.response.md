### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's components and their roles:

1. **TreeNode Class**: Represents each node in the tree with attributes to store edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size.
2. **Tree Class**: Manages the tree structure, including adding edges and rooting the tree.
3. **func_1**: Uses a stack-based approach to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree rooted at a given vertex.
4. **func_2**: Recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree rooted at a given vertex.
5. **func_3**: Determines if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
6. **func_4**: Uses a binary search approach to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition specified in `func_3`.
7. **func_5**: Reads input, constructs the tree, roots the tree at node 0, and prints the result of `func_4`.

### Analysis:

- **TreeNode and Tree Classes**: These classes correctly represent the tree structure and provide methods to add edges and root the tree.
- **func_1 and func_2**: Both functions are designed to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size. `func_1` uses an iterative approach, while `func_2` is recursive. Both functions should yield the same results.
- **func_3**: This function checks if the conditions for removing `k` edges to form valid components of at least size `x` are met. It correctly returns `True` or `False` based on the conditions.
- **func_4**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition checked by `func_3`. It correctly narrows down the search space and returns the correct maximum `x`.
- **func_5**: This function handles input reading, tree construction, and the final output. It correctly calls `func_4` to determine the result.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently constructs the tree, roots it, and uses a binary search combined with tree traversal to determine the maximum `x`.

**Correctness: True**
