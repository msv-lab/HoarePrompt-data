Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Tree Class Missing**: The code references a `Tree` class that is not defined in the provided snippet. Without the `Tree` class, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` cannot operate as intended.

2. **Rooting the Tree**: The function `func_5` calls `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)`, which suggests that the tree needs to be rooted at vertex `0`. However, the `Tree` class and the `root_tree_non_recursive` method are not provided, so it's unclear how the tree is being rooted.

3. **Vertex Indexing**: The problem specifies that vertices are numbered from 1 to n, but the code seems to use 0-based indexing. This could lead to incorrect results if the tree is not properly adjusted for 0-based indexing.

4. **Edge Cases**: The binary search in `func_4` is designed to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and have each remaining component of size at least `x`. However, the implementation does not handle edge cases where `x` might be 1 or where the tree structure might lead to different outcomes.

5. **Input Handling**: The program assumes that the input is read from standard input, which is fine, but it does not handle the multiple test cases format correctly. The loop for handling multiple test cases is missing.

To correct the program, the `Tree` class needs to be defined, including methods for adding edges and rooting the tree. Additionally, the program should handle multiple test cases correctly and ensure that vertex indexing is consistent.

Here is a possible outline of the `Tree` class and the necessary adjustments:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = []
        self.parent = None
        self.good_components = 0
        self.remaining_size = 1

class Tree:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.vertices = [TreeNode() for _ in range(n)]

    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        self.vertices[u].children.append(v)
        self.vertices[v].children.append(u)

    def root_tree_non_recursive(self, root, parent):
        stack = [(root, parent)]
        while stack:
            node, par = stack.pop()
            self.vertices[node].parent = par
            new_children = [child for child in self.vertices[node].children if child != par]
            self.vertices[node].children = new_children
            stack.extend([(child, node) for child in new_children])

# The rest of the functions remain largely the same, but with necessary adjustments for 0-based indexing and multiple test cases.
```

With these adjustments, the program should be able to handle the problem correctly.
