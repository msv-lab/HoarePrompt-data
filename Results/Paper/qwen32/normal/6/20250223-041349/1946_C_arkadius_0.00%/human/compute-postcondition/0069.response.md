The only object in the loop head is the variable `u`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If there are more elements in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `u` was the last element in `tree.vertices[v].children` that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one more element that has not yet been processed. Since `u` was the last processed element, the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children` should be the new `u`.

State: **`v` and `postorder` are the values of the last element popped from `stack`; `stack` has two more elements than before, which are `(v, True)` and `(u, False)`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two elements. `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not yet been processed.**
