Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree with `n` vertices, where `n` is greater than 1; `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true; `mid` is `(((n + 2) // 2 + n + 1) // 2 + n + 1) // 2`; `beg` is `(((n + 2) // 2 + n + 1) // 2 + n + 1) // 2`; `end` is `n` and `((n + 2) // 2 + n + 1) // 2` is less than `n`.**

In natural language: The variable `beg` is now set to the value of `mid`, which is `(((n + 2) // 2 + n + 1) // 2 + n + 1) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
