### Reasoning:

Let's break down the functionality of each function and see if they collectively meet the problem requirements.

1. **TreeNode and Tree Classes:**
   - These classes are used to represent the tree structure.
   - `TreeNode` holds information about each node, including its children, subtree size, parent, and other relevant properties.
   - `Tree` manages the vertices and provides methods to add edges and root the tree.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree at a specified vertex, ensuring that each node knows its parent and children.

2. **func_1 and func_2:**
   - Both functions perform a post-order traversal of the tree.
   - They calculate the number of good components (subtrees with size at least `x`) and the remaining size of smaller components.
   - The difference between `func_1` and `func_2` is that `func_1` uses an iterative stack-based approach, while `func_2` is recursive.
   - Both functions return the same results and are functionally equivalent.

3. **func_3:**
   - This function checks if it's possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` (or `func_2`) to determine the number of good components and the remaining size.
   - It returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.

4. **func_4:**
   - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` for which `func_3` returns `True`.
   - It iterates from 1 to `n`, adjusting the search range based on the results of `func_3`.
   - The final value of `beg` is the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.

5. **func_5:**
   - This function reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The program is structured to handle multiple test cases efficiently.
- It correctly constructs and roots the tree.
- The binary search in `func_4` ensures that the maximum `x` is found.
- `func_3` correctly checks the conditions for each `x`.
- `func_1` and `func_2` are equivalent and correctly compute the necessary values for `func_3`.

### Conclusion:

The provided functions collectively meet the problem requirements. They correctly implement the logic to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.

**Correctness: True**
