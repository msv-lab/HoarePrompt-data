Output State: **`v` is a vertex with at least one child, `postorder` is not empty, and `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully processed. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been updated to include the good components of all children of `v` and any additional good components where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been updated to include the remaining sizes of all children `u` where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size < x`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the vertex `v` has had its `good_components` count updated to reflect all its children's good components, and any additional good components where the child's `remaining_size` was greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `v`'s `remaining_size` has been adjusted to include the `remaining_size` of all children where the child's `remaining_size` was less than `x`. The `postorder` list and other unaffected variables remain unchanged.
