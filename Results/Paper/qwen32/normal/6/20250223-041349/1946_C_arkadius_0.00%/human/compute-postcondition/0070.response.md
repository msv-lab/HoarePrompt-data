Output State: **`v` and `postorder` are the values of the last element popped from `stack`; `stack` has three more elements than before, which are `(v, True)`, `(u, False)`, and the newly added `(u, False)`; `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two elements. `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not yet been processed.**

In natural language: The `stack` now contains three more elements than before, specifically `(v, True)`, `(u, False)`, and the newly added `(u, False)`. The values of `v`, `postorder`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` remain unchanged. The variable `u` still represents the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not yet been processed.
