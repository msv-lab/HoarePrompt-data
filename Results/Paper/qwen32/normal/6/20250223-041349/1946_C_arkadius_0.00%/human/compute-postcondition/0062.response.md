Output State: **`v` is a valid vertex in `tree`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `stack` has one less element and is not empty if it had more than one element before popping, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v`, plus the number of children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed for all iterations, the `good_components` of vertex `v` will include the sum of `good_components` of all its children plus an additional count for each child whose `remaining_size` meets or exceeds `x`. The `remaining_size` of vertex `v` will be the sum of `remaining_size` values of its children that do not meet the `x` threshold. The state of `v`, `postorder`, and the modified `stack` remain consistent with the initial conditions, with `stack` having one less element if it originally had more than one.
