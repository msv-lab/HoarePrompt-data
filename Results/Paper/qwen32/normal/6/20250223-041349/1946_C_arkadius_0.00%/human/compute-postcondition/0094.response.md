Postcondition: **`v` is a vertex, and `postorder` is either empty or not empty. If `postorder` is not empty, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully processed, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` includes the good components of all children of `v` and any additional good components where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` includes the remaining sizes of all children `u` where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size < x`. If `postorder` is empty, no specific changes are made to `tree.vertices[v]` related to its children, good components, or remaining size.**
