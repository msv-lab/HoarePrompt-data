Output State: **`v` is the first element of the last tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` now has three elements which are the tuple `(v, True)`, `(u, False)`, and `(u, False)`, `tree` is an object representing a tree structure where `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element, `postorder` remains `True` if it was `True` in the popped tuple, and `stack` is not empty if it had more than one element before popping. `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `u` has been added to the `stack` with the `False` value, making the total number of elements in `stack` three. All other variables remain unchanged.
