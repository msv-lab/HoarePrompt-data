Output State: **`v` is the first element of the last tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` now has four elements which are the tuple `(v, True)`, `(u, False)`, `(u, False)`, and `(u, False)`, `tree` is an object representing a tree structure where `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element, `postorder` remains `True` if it was `True` in the popped tuple, and `stack` is not empty if it had more than one element before popping. `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children` after the previously processed `u`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(u, False)` to the `stack`. Therefore, the number of elements in `stack` increases from three to four. The values of `v`, `postorder`, `tree`, and `u` remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
