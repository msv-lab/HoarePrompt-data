Postcondition: **`v` and `postorder` are the values of the last element popped from `stack`. `postorder` is not empty. If `postorder` was empty before, `stack` had `n + 1` elements where the first element was `(v, True)` and the remaining `n` elements were `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`. Otherwise, `stack` had one less element than before. The current state of `postorder` indicates that there are still elements to process in `postorder`.**
