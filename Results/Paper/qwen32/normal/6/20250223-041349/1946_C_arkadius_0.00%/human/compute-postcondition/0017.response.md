The value of `end` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is given by the expression `(((n + 2) // 2 + n + 1) // 2 + n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree with `n` vertices, where `n` is greater than 1; `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true; `mid` is `(((n + 2) // 2 + n + 1) // 2 + n + 1) // 2`; `beg` is `((n + 2) // 2 + n + 1) // 2`; `end` is `mid - 1` and `((n + 2) // 2 + n + 1) // 2` is less than `n`.**
