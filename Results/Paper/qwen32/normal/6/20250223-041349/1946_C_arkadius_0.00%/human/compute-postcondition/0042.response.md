Output State: **`v` is the first element of the last tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` now has `len(tree.vertices[v].children) + 1` elements which are the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`, `tree` is an object representing a tree structure where `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one element, `postorder` remains `True` if it was `True` in the popped tuple, and `stack` is not empty if it had more than one element before popping.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `v` is still the vertex that was last popped from the stack, and `postorder` retains its value from the popped tuple. The stack now contains the tuple `(v, True)` followed by a tuple `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`. The number of elements in the stack is equal to the number of children of `v` plus one. The `tree` structure and the `postorder` flag remain unchanged except for the stack's content as described.
