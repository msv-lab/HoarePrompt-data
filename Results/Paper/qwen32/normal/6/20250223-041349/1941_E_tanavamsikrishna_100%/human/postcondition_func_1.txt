The function reads input values for the number of rows (`n`), number of columns (`m`), number of rows to consider for cost calculation (`k`), and a distance parameter (`d`). It also reads a 2D list (`rows`) of integers with specific constraints. The function calculates a cost for each row using an unspecified function `func_1` and then computes the sum of costs for every possible group of `k` consecutive rows. Finally, it prints the minimum sum of these costs.
