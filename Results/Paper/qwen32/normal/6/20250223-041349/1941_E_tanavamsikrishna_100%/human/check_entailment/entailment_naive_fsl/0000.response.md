Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a given row while adhering to the constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization Error in `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes the first `d` elements of the row, but it does not correctly account for the fact that supports must be installed at both the first and last columns (i.e., `row[0]` and `row[m-1]` should always be 1, and the calculations should ensure that the last column is also included in the cost calculation).

2. **Heap Usage in `func_1`:**
   - The heap is used to keep track of the minimum costs, but the logic for updating the heap and calculating the cost for each position is flawed. The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is incorrect and can lead to incorrect cost calculations.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation in the loop `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` does not correctly account for the constraints that the distance between supports must be no more than `d`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3 11 1 4
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

However, the provided program may not correctly calculate the minimum cost for this input due to the issues mentioned above.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
