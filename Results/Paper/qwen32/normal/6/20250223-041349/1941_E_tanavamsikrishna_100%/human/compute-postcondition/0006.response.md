The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the `costs` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where each element `a_{i, j}` is an integer input from the user, and `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`; `rows` must have at least `k` rows; `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`; `i` is 1**
