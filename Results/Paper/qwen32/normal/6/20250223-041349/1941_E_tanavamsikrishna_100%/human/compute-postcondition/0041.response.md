The code snippet `heappush(min_heap, e)` adds the tuple `e` to the `min_heap`. Since `min_heap` already contains `e` and `(e[0] + 1, 1)`, after this operation, `min_heap` will have `e` duplicated. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` is `e[0] + 1`, `row[2]` is `2*e[0] + 1`, `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged, `min_heap` contains `e`, `e`, and `(e[0] + 1, 1)`, `i` is 2, `d` is -1.**
