To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `d`. The loop condition is `for i in range(d, len(row))`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- `d` is -1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since the loop variable `i` is incremented automatically in each iteration), and `d` remains unchanged as it is the starting point of the range.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:
- The loop starts with `i` in the range from `d` to `len(row)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `d` remains -1 as it is the starting point of the range.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` is `e[0] + 1`, `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`, `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged, `min_heap` contains `e` and `(e[0] + 1, 1)`, `i` is 2, `d` is -1**
