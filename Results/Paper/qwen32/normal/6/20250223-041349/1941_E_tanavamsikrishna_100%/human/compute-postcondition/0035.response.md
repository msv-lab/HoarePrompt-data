To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `e` (specifically `e[1]`), `i`, and `d`.

The loop condition is:
```
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```
This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the second element of the tuple `e` (which is `e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `row[0]` is 1
- `row[1]` is `e[0] + 1`
- `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`
- `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged
- `min_heap` contains `e` and `(e[0] + 1, 1)`
- `i` is 2
- `d` is -1

Let's break down the condition:
- `e` is a tuple popped from `min_heap`, and `e[1]` is the second element of this tuple.
- `i` is 2.
- `d` is -1.

So the condition becomes:
```
e[1] <= 2 - (-1 + 2)
e[1] <= 2 - 1
e[1] <= 1
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `e[1]` must be less than or equal to 1. Since `min_heap` contains `e` and `(e[0] + 1, 1)`, the next `e` popped from the heap could be `(e[0] + 1, 1)`, which means `e[1]` could be 1.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `min_heap` should contain `(e[0] + 1, 1)` as the next element to be popped, making `e[1]` equal to 1.

State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` is `e[0] + 1`, `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`, `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged, `min_heap` contains `e` and `(e[0] + 1, 1)`, `i` is 2, `d` is -1**
