Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires constructing bridges over `k` consecutive rows of a grid, minimizing the total cost of installing supports. The cost function for each support is `a_{i,j} + 1`, and there are constraints on the placement of supports (must be at the start and end of each row, and must be no more than `d` apart).

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`

This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports in a single row. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**: Sets the first `d` elements of the row.
   - The first element is set to `1`.
   - The next `d-1` elements are incremented by `2` sequentially.
   
2. **Heap Initialization**: Creates a min-heap from the first `d` elements of the row. This heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost encountered within a sliding window of size `d+2`.

3. **Sliding Window**: Iterates through the rest of the row, updating the cost for each position based on the minimum cost in the heap.
   - It pops elements from the heap that are out of the sliding window range.
   - It calculates the cost for the current position as the minimum cost from the heap plus the current cell's cost plus `1`.
   - It pushes the current cost and index back into the heap.

4. **Return Value**: Returns the cost of the last element in the modified row, which represents the minimum cost to install supports in that row.

#### Function `func_2`

This function handles multiple test cases and calculates the minimum total cost for each test case.

1. **Input Parsing**: Reads the number of test cases and for each test case, reads the dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`), the number of bridges (`k`), and the maximum distance between supports (`d`).

2. **Cost Calculation**: For each row in the grid, it calculates the minimum cost to install supports using `func_1`.

3. **Total Cost Calculation**: For each possible set of `k` consecutive rows, it calculates the total cost of installing supports and stores these sums.

4. **Output**: Prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Correctness Analysis

The program's logic is correct in terms of calculating the minimum cost for a single row using a sliding window approach with a min-heap. However, there are a few issues:

1. **Heap Management**: The heap should only contain elements within the sliding window. The current implementation pops elements from the heap without ensuring they are within the sliding window, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where `d` is very small or where the grid is very narrow.

3. **Complexity**: The program's complexity is not optimal for large grids. For instance, the sliding window approach could be more efficiently implemented using a deque to maintain the sliding window.

### Conclusion

Despite the overall logic being correct, the implementation has issues in heap management that could lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
