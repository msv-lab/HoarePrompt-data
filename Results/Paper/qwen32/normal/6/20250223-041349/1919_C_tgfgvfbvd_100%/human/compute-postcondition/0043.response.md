The value of `c` is set to 0. The values of `l`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0; `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0; `n` is an input integer.**
