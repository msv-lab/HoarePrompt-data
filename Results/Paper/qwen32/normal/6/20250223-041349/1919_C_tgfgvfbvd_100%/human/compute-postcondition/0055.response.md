The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The previous values of the variables `l`, `a`, `b`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change is that `c` is now 1 instead of 0.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**
