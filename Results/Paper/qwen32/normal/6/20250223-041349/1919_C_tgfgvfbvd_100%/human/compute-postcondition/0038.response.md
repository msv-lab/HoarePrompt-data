To determine what will be printed when the `print(c)` statement is executed, let's break down the given initial state:

1. `a` is the smallest value in the list `l`.
2. `b` is the second smallest value in the list `l`.
3. `c` is the count of values in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Given this information, `c` is calculated by counting the number of elements in the list `l` that are strictly greater than both `a` and `b`.

Since the exact list `l` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical value of `c`. However, we can describe `c` precisely based on the given information.

Output: **c (where c is the count of values in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`)**
