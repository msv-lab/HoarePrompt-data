Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `x + 1`. If `l[x] <= a`, then `a` is `l[x]` and if `a > b`, `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, if `l[x] <= b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` remains 0. If `l[x] > b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` is set to 1.**
