Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than `x + 1`; `x` is `x + 1`. If `l[x] <= a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] <= b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped; otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values.**
