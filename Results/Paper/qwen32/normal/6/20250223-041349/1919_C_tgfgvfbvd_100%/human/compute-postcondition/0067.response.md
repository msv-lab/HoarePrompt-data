The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the current index, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is either the value of `l[x]` or the previous value of `b`, `b` is either the value of `l[x]` or the previous value of `a`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `x + 1`**
