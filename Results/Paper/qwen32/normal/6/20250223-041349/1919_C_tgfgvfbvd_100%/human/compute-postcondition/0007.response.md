The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is `float('inf')` and `b` is also `float('inf')`. After the swap, `a` will still be `float('inf')` and `b` will still be `float('inf')`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0.**
