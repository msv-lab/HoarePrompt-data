The code modifies the value of `t` by performing integer division by 5 and then adding 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

The new value of `t` is calculated as `t // 5 + 1`. Given the initial state that `t` is `b * 2`, the new value of `t` becomes `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first value from input as an integer; `b` is the second value from input as an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 2`.**
