Output State: **`t` is `((b * 2) // 5 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1)` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `((b * 2) // 5 + 1 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1)`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first value from input as an integer; `b` is the second value from input as an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 2`; `t2` is `a - t * 15 + b * 4`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated based on the previous value of `t` and the value of `t2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
