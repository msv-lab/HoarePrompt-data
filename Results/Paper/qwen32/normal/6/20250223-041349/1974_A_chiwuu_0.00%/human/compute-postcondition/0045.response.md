The code snippet `t = t // 5` modifies the value of `t` by performing integer division by 5. Initially, `t` is defined as `b * 2`. After the operation, `t` will be `(b * 2) // 5`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first value from input as an integer; `b` is the second value from input as an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 2`.**
