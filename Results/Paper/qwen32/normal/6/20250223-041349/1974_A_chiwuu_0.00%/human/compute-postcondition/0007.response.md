The value of `t` is initially `b * 2` and is divisible by 5. The code snippet `t = t // 5` modifies the value of `t` by performing integer division by 5. Therefore, the new value of `t` will be `(b * 2) // 5`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5`, `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4), `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer, `b` is the second integer from the current input line as an integer.**
