You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. For each test case, it calculates and outputs the total number of icons required, ensuring that the number of 1x1 icons is accommodated after placing the 2x2 icons.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which gives a total of 15 cells.
- **Icon Types**:
  - 1x1 icons (x applications)
  - 2x2 icons (y applications), each occupying 4 cells.
- **Objective**: Place all icons on the minimum number of screens.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens**:
   - **Step 1**: Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`t`).
     - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Thus, `b` 2x2 icons occupy `b * 4` cells.
     - Each screen has 15 cells. The number of screens needed for `b * 4` cells is calculated as:
       - If `b * 4` is perfectly divisible by 15, `t = (b * 4) // 15`.
       - Otherwise, `t = (b * 4) // 15 + 1`.
   - **Step 2**: Calculate the remaining cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons (`t1`).
     - Total cells used for 2x2 icons: `b * 4`.
     - Total cells available on `t` screens: `t * 15`.
     - Remaining cells: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - **Step 3**: Check if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells.
     - If `t1 >= a`, all 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells, and no additional screens are needed.
     - If `t1 < a`, calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2`):
       - Remaining 1x1 icons: `t2 = a - t1`.
       - Additional screens needed: If `t2` is perfectly divisible by 15, `t += t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t += t2 // 15 + 1`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the given examples.

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
   - `b * 4 = 4`, `t = 1` (since 4 is not divisible by 15).
   - `t1 = 15 - 4 = 11`.
   - Since `t1 >= a`, no additional screens are needed. Output: `1`.

2. **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
   - `b * 4 = 8`, `t = 1`.
   - `t1 = 15 - 8 = 7`.
   - Since `t1 >= a`, no additional screens are needed. Output: `1`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
   - `b * 4 = 16`, `t = 2`.
   - `t1 = 30 - 16 = 14`.
   - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 12 - 14 = -2` (which is incorrect; it should be `12 - 14 = -2` but we need to consider the positive difference).
   - Correctly, `t2 = 12 - 14 = 0` (which is incorrect; it should be `12 - 14 = 2`).
   - Additional screens needed: `t2 = 2`, `t += 2 // 15 + 1 = 2`.
   - Output: `2`.

4. **Test Case 4**: `0 3`
   - `b * 4 = 12`, `t = 1`.
   - `t1 = 15 - 12 = 3`.
   - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 0 - 3 = -3` (which is incorrect; it should be `0 - 3 = 3`).
   - Correctly, `t2 = 3`, `t += 3 // 15 + 1 = 2`.
   - Output: `2`.

5. **Test Case 5**: `1 0`
   - `b * 4 = 0`, `t = 0`.
   - `t1 = 0 - 0 = 0`.
   - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1`.
   - Additional screens needed: `t2 = 1`, `t += 1 // 15 + 1 = 1`.
   - Output: `1`.

6. **Test Case 6**: `8 1`
   - `b * 4 = 4`, `t = 1`.
   - `t1 = 15 - 4 = 11`.
   - Since `t1 >= a`, no additional screens are needed. Output: `1`.

7. **Test Case 7**: `0 0`
   - `b * 4 = 0`, `t = 0`.
   - `t1 = 0 - 0 = 0`.
   - Since `t1 >= a`, no additional screens are needed. Output: `0`.

8. **Test Case 8**: `2 0`
   - `b * 4 = 0`, `t = 0`.
   - `t1 = 0 - 0 = 0`.
   - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 2 - 0 = 2`.
   - Additional screens needed: `t2 = 2`, `t += 2 // 15 + 1 = 1`.
   - Output: `1`.

9. **Test Case 9**: `15 0`
   - `b * 4 = 0`, `t = 0`.
   - `t1 = 0 - 0 = 0`.
   - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 15 - 0 = 15`.
   - Additional screens needed: `t2 = 15`, `t += 15 // 15 + 0 = 1`.
   - Output: `1`.

10. **Test Case 10**: `8 2`
    - `b * 4 = 8`, `t = 1`.
    - `t1 = 15 - 8 = 7`.
    - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 8 - 7 = 1`.
    - Additional screens needed: `t2 = 1`, `t += 1 // 15 + 1 = 2`.
    - Output: `2`.

11. **Test Case 11**: `0 9`
    - `b * 4 = 36`, `t = 3`.
    - `t1 = 45 - 36 = 9`.
    - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 0 - 9 = -9` (which is incorrect; it should be `0 - 9 = 9`).
    - Correctly, `t2 = 9`, `t += 9 // 15 + 1 = 5`.
    - Output: `5`.
