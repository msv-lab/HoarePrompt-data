Let's break down the problem step by step based on the provided initial state and the given Python code snippet.

1. **Determine the value of `t`**:
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t` is calculated as `(b * 2) // 5`.
   - Otherwise, `t` is calculated as `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`.

2. **Determine the value of `t1`**:
   - If `t = (b * 2) // 5`, then `t1` is calculated as `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4`.
   - Otherwise, `t1` is calculated as `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Check if `t1` is less than `a`**:
   - If `t1 >= a`, no change is made to `t`.
   - If `t1 < a`, `t` is updated based on the value of `t2`:
     - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

Given these steps, let's determine the final value of `t` that will be printed.

### Example Calculation
Let's assume some values for `a` and `b` to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `a = 20` and `b = 10`.

1. **Calculate `t`**:
   - `(b * 2) // 5` = `(10 * 2) // 5` = `20 // 5` = `4`
   - Since `4 % 5 != 0`, `t` is `4 + 1` = `5`

2. **Calculate `t1`**:
   - Since `t = 5`, `t1` is `(((10 * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - 10 * 4` = `(4 + 1) * 15 - 40` = `5 * 15 - 40` = `75 - 40` = `35`

3. **Check if `t1` is less than `a`**:
   - `t1 = 35` and `a = 20`, so `t1 >= a` is `False`.
   - Since `t1 < a`, we need to update `t`:
     - `t2 = a - t1` = `20 - 35` = `-15`
     - Since `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` = `5 + (-15) // 15` = `5 + (-1)` = `4`

So, the final value of `t` is `4`.

### General Case
In the general case, the value of `t` will be determined by the above calculations depending on the values of `a` and `b`. The final value of `t` will be printed.

Output: **t (where t is determined by the calculations based on the values of a and b)**
