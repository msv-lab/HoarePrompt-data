Postcondition: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `((b * 2) // 5) + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 1`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` becomes `(b * 2) // 5 + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` becomes `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i` retain their initial values as described in the precondition.**
