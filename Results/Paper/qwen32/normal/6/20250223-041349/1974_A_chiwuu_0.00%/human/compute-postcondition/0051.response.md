To determine the new output state, we need to focus on how the variable `t` changes due to the given code snippet. Here is the breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is calculated as `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`
   - `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4)
   - `a` is the first value from input as an integer
   - `b` is the second value from input as an integer
   - `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`
   - `i` is `x + 2`
   - `t2` is `a - t * 15 + b * 4`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet updates `t` by adding `t2 // 15` to the current value of `t`.

3. **New Value of `t`:**
   - `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`.

4. **Output State:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged, only `t` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first value from input as an integer; `b` is the second value from input as an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 2`; `t2` is `a - t * 15 + b * 4`.**
