Postcondition: **`t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` becomes `(b * 2) // 5 + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` becomes `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i` retain their initial values as described in the precondition.**
