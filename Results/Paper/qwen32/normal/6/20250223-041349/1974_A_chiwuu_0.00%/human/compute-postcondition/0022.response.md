Postcondition: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`. `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4). `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer. `b` is the second integer from the current input line as an integer. `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `t = (b * 2) // 5`, otherwise `t1` is `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then no change is made to `t`. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, where `t2` is `a - t1`.**
