The code snippet provided updates the value of `t1` based on the current value of `t` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t1` is calculated differently depending on whether `t` is `(b * 2) // 5` or `((b * 2) // 5) + 1`. However, the new assignment `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` overrides the previous definition of `t1`.

Given this, the new value of `t1` will be `t * 15 - b * 4`, regardless of the previous condition.

The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `((b * 2) // 5) + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 1`.**
