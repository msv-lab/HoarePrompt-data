Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. `n` is assigned the value of `t`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b * 2
    if t % 5 == 0:
        t = t // 5
    else:
        t = t // 5 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`. `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4). `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer. `b` is the second integer from the current input line as an integer. `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `t = (b * 2) // 5`, otherwise `t1` is `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then no change is made to `t`. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, where `t2` is `a - t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `((b * 2) // 5) + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 1`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` becomes `(b * 2) // 5 + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` becomes `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i` retain their initial values as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first value from input as an integer; `b` is the second value from input as an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 2`. If `t1 >= a`, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is recalculated as `((b * 2) // 5 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1)` if the original `t % 5 == 0`, or `((b * 2) // 5 + 1 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1)` if the original `t % 5 != 0`. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i`) remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
