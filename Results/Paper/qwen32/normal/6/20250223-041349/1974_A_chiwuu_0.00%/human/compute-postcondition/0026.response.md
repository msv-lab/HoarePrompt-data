The code snippet provided is:

```python
a = int(a)
```

This line converts the variable `a` from its current type (which could be a string, based on the context of input handling) to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `t`, `t1`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the value of `a` is converted to an integer. Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`. `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4). `a` is an integer. `b` is the second integer from the current input line. `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `t = (b * 2) // 5`, otherwise `t1` is `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then no change is made to `t`. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, where `t2` is `a - t1`. `i` is `x + 1`.**
