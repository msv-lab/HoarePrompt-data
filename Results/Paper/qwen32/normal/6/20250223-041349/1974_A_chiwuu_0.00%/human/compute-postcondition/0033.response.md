The code snippet `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. Therefore, the value of `t` remains the same as it was in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `((b * 2) // 5) + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 1`.**
