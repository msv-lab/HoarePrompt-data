To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case. The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the inputs `a` and `b`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**: The number of test cases `n` is set to the value of `t` from the input.
2. **Loop Iteration**: For each test case:
   - Read integers `a` and `b`.
   - Calculate `t` as `(b * 2) // 5` if `b * 2` is divisible by 5; otherwise, `t` is `((b * 2) // 5) + 1`.
   - Calculate `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, calculate `t2` as `a - t1`. Then update `t` to `t + t2 // 15` if `t2` is divisible by 15; otherwise, update `t` to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
   - Print the final value of `t` for the current test case.

After all iterations, the loop will have processed each test case independently, and the final output state will be a series of printed values, one for each test case.

### Output State

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of printed values, one for each test case, representing the final value of `t` calculated for that test case.

**Output State:** **A series of integers, each representing the final value of `t` for each test case.**

In natural language: The output state is a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the final computed value of `t` for each test case processed by the loop. Each integer is printed on a new line.
