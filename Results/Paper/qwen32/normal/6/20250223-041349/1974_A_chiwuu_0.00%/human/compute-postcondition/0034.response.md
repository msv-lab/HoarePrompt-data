Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `((b * 2) // 5) + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 1`; `t2` is `a - t1`.**

This means that the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i` retain their initial definitions and values. The variable `t2` is newly assigned the value of `a - t1`.
