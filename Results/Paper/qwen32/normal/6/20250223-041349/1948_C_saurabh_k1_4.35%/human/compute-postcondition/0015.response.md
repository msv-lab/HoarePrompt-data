Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input; `b` is a new list of strings where each string is a character from the latest input. If `b[n - 2]` equals `<`, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
