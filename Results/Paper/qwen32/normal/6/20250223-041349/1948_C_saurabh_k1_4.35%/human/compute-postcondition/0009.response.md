The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common placeholder for a loop variable that is not used inside the loop. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`. Since the loop variable `_` does not influence the loop's continuation condition, we only need to consider the input that dictates the number of iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
- `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If the second last element of `b` is `'<'`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `'<'`. Otherwise, the second last element of `b` is not equal to the string `'<'`.

The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`. To execute one more time, the input must specify one more iteration. Therefore, the input should be adjusted to reflect that one more iteration is to be performed.

Since the loop variable `_` does not change the state, we only need to consider the input that controls the number of iterations. The state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` does not need to be adjusted based on the loop head; however, the input that controls the loop should be incremented by 1 to allow for one more iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input; `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If the second last element of `b` is `'<'`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `'<'`. Otherwise, the second last element of `b` is not equal to the string `'<'`. The input for the number of iterations should be adjusted to allow for one more iteration.**
