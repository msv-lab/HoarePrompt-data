### Reasoning

The problem requires determining if a robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) by following the arrows in the grid. The robot can move left, right, up, or down each second, followed by moving in the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands in.

The provided program's logic is overly simplistic and only checks if the second last character of the second row is '<'. If it is, the program outputs 'No'; otherwise, it outputs 'Yes'. This is not a sufficient condition to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

Let's analyze the given function summary and the program code in detail:

**Function Summary:**
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it checks if the second last character of the second string is '<'.
- If it is, the function outputs 'No'; otherwise, it outputs 'Yes'.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
```

### Analysis

The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the entire path the robot can take through the grid. The robot's ability to reach the target cell (2, n) depends on the sequence of arrows in both rows and how the robot can navigate through them.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

**Test Case 1:**
```
4
>><<
>>><
```
- The program checks `b[n - 2]` which is `b[2]` and it is `'<'`. According to the program, it should print 'No'.
- However, the robot can follow the path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4). Thus, the correct output should be 'Yes'.

**Test Case 2:**
```
2
><
><
```
- The program checks `b[n - 2]` which is `b[0]` and it is `'>'`. According to the program, it should print 'Yes'.
- The robot can follow the path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2). Thus, the correct output should be 'Yes'.

**Test Case 3:**
```
4
>>><
>><<
```
- The program checks `b[n - 2]` which is `b[2]` and it is `'<'`. According to the program, it should print 'No'.
- The robot cannot reach (2, 4) because the only way to reach row 2 is through column 1, and from there, the arrows force the robot back to column 1. Thus, the correct output should be 'No'.

**Test Case 4:**
```
6
>><<><
><>>><
```
- The program checks `b[n - 2]` which is `b[4]` and it is `'>'`. According to the program, it should print 'Yes'.
- The robot can follow the path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6). Thus, the correct output should be 'Yes'.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the entire grid configuration. It only checks a single condition which is not sufficient.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

### Final: **False**
