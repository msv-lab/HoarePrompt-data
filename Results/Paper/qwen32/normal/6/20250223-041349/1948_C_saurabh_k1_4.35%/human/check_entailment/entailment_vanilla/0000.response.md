Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n). The robot has two actions each second:
1. Move up, down, left, or right.
2. Follow the arrow in the cell it ends up in.

The key points to consider are:
- The robot must eventually move down to row 2.
- Once in row 2, the robot must be able to move right until it reaches column n.
- The arrows in the grid ensure that the robot does not move outside the grid.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
1. Reads the number of columns `n`.
2. Reads the first row of the grid as a list of characters.
3. Reads the second row of the grid as a list of characters.
4. Checks if the character in the second row, second last column (i.e., `b[n - 2]`) is '<'.
   - If it is '<', it prints 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

### Correctness Check
The program only checks the character in the second row, second last column (`b[n - 2]`). This is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n). The robot's path depends on the entire sequence of arrows in both rows and how the robot can navigate through them.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4
4
>>><
>><<
```
The program would print 'NO' because `b[n - 2]` is '<'. However, the robot can still reach (2, 4) by following this path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the entire grid configuration. It only checks a single condition which is not sufficient.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
