Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The program only checks the second last character of the second row and makes a decision based on that, which is not sufficient to determine the reachability of the target cell. The robot's movement is influenced by both rows and the sequence of arrows, and the program needs to simulate the robot's movement according to the rules specified in the problem description.
