Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) which is even, followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(str, input()))
    b = list(map(str, input()))
    if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input; `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If the second last element of `b` is `'<'`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `'<'`. Otherwise, the second last element of `b` is not equal to the string `'<'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input; `b` is a new list of strings where each string is a character from the latest input. If `b[n - 2]` equals `<`, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the latest input; `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to `<`, the behavior is as described in the if part. Otherwise, the behavior is as described in the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
