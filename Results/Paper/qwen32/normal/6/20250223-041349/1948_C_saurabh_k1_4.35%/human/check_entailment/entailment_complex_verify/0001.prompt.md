You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) which is even, followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it has determined whether the second last character of the string `b` is `'<'`. If it is, it prints `'No'`; otherwise, it prints `'Yes'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are no longer in their initial state as they have been updated through each iteration, but `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating all test cases have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it checks if the second last character of the second string is '<'. If it is, the function outputs 'No'; otherwise, it outputs 'Yes'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n). The robot has two actions each second:
1. Move up, down, left, or right.
2. Follow the arrow in the cell it ends up in.

The key points to consider are:
- The robot must eventually move down to row 2.
- Once in row 2, the robot must be able to move right until it reaches column n.
- The arrows in the grid ensure that the robot does not move outside the grid.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
1. Reads the number of columns `n`.
2. Reads the first row of the grid as a list of characters.
3. Reads the second row of the grid as a list of characters.
4. Checks if the character in the second row, second last column (i.e., `b[n - 2]`) is '<'.
   - If it is '<', it prints 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

### Correctness Check
The program only checks the character in the second row, second last column (`b[n - 2]`). This is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n). The robot's path depends on the entire sequence of arrows in both rows and how the robot can navigate through them.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4
4
>>><
>><<
```
The program would print 'NO' because `b[n - 2]` is '<'. However, the robot can still reach (2, 4) by following this path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the entire grid configuration. It only checks a single condition which is not sufficient.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
