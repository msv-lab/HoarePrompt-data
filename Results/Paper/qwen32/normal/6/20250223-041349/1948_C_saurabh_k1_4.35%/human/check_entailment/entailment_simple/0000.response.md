Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the movement rules and grid configurations provided in the problem statement. The program only checks if the second last character of the second row string `b` is '<'. If it is, the program outputs 'No'; otherwise, it outputs 'Yes'. This check does not consider the entire path and movement rules described in the problem.

The robot's movement involves two actions: moving in one of the four possible directions (left, right, down, or up) and then following the arrow in the cell it lands on. The robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n). The program should simulate the robot's movement according to the rules and determine if it can reach the target cell.

Since the provided program does not simulate the robot's movement and only checks a single condition, it cannot correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell for all possible grid configurations.

Correctness: **False**
