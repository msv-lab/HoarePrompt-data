The code snippet provided is `word = str(i)`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so it is impossible to determine the exact value of `word` after the execution of the code. Given the task constraints and the information provided, we must assume that `i` is a variable that should be defined in the context of the problem.

Since `i` is not defined, we cannot proceed with a specific value for `word`. However, if we hypothetically assume that `i` is a variable that holds some value (let's say `i` is 5 for the sake of example), then `word` would be the string representation of `i`, which is `'5'`.

Given the lack of definition for `i`, the most accurate representation of the output state, while adhering to the format, would be to state that `word` is assigned the string representation of `i`, without specifying the exact value of `i`.

However, since the task requires a specific format and we need to provide an output state, let's assume `i` is indeed a variable that should be defined and proceed with a hypothetical value for demonstration purposes.

Assuming `i` is 5:
Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is '5'**

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, the correct and most accurate response, acknowledging the missing variable, would be:
Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is str(i) where `i` is undefined**
