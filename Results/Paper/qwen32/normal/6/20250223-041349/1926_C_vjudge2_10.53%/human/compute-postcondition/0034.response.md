To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `t` is 0
- `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers
- `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 except `values[i]` which is now `values[last] + values[remainder]`
- `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45
- `total` is 45
- `n` must be at least 10
- `word` is `str(i)` where `i` is undefined
- `last` is the integer representation of the last digit of `word`
- `remainder` is the integer value of `word` with its last digit removed
- `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`

Code snippet:
```python
sum_values[i] = sum_total
```

The code snippet assigns the value of `sum_total` to `sum_values[i]`.

Given that `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, and `sum_values[i]` is being updated to `sum_total`, we need to understand the implications of this assignment. However, the specific value of `i` is not provided, and `i` is derived from `word`, which is undefined in the initial state. Therefore, we will express the output state in terms of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 except `values[i]` which is now `values[last] + values[remainder]`, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[i]` is now `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is `str(i)` where `i` is undefined, `last` is the integer representation of the last digit of `word`, `remainder` is the integer value of `word` with its last digit removed, `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, this means:
- `t` remains 0.
- `numbers` remains a list containing `t` input integers.
- `values` remains a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 except `values[i]` which is now `values[last] + values[remainder]`.
- `sum_values` is updated such that `sum_values[i]` is now `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`.
- `total` remains 45.
- `n` must still be at least 10.
- `word` is still `str(i)` where `i` is undefined.
- `last` is still the integer representation of the last digit of `word`.
- `remainder` is still the integer value of `word` with its last digit removed.
- `sum_total` remains `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`.
