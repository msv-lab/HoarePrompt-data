To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum_values[n])` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is 0.
- `numbers` is `[20, 21]`.
- `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9, and additional elements are calculated based on some unspecified formula (not relevant for this output).
- `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` (which is 22 in this case) with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45. The additional elements are also calculated based on some unspecified formula (not relevant for this output).
- `total` is 45.

### Focus on the `print(sum_values[n])` Statement:
The variable `n` is not defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, `n` must be a variable that is defined elsewhere in the code (not shown here). Since `n` is not provided, we can't determine its exact value. But we can still describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Determining the Output:
The `sum_values` list is initialized with the first 10 elements as 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45. These are cumulative sums of the first 10 natural numbers (0 through 9).

If `n` were to be one of these indices (0 through 9), the output would be the corresponding cumulative sum. For example:
- If `n` is 0, the output would be 0.
- If `n` is 1, the output would be 1.
- If `n` is 2, the output would be 3.
- And so on...

Since `n` is not specified, we can only say that the output will be the element at index `n` in the `sum_values` list.

### Final Answer:
Output: **sum_values[n] (where sum_values is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, and n is an index into this list)**
