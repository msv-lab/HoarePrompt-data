Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program has a few issues that prevent it from working correctly for all test cases:

1. The function `func_1()` is defined after it is called, which will result in a `NameError` because the function is not defined at the time of the call.
2. The variable `n` in the second loop is not defined in the scope of that loop. It should be `max(numbers)` or another variable that represents the maximum `n` across all test cases.
3. The variable `sum_total` is used but not defined. It seems like it should be `total` or `sum_values[i]`.
4. The `sum_values` list is being updated with the wrong variable. It should be using `values[i]` instead of `sum_total`.
5. The final loop should iterate over the `numbers` list, but the `sum_values` list is being indexed with `n`, which is not defined in that scope. It should be iterating over the `numbers` list and using the appropriate index.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[-1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

This corrected version should work correctly for all test cases as described in the problem statement.
