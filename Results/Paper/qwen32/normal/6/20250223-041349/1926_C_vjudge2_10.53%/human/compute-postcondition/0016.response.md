The given code snippet `values[i] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the `i`-th index of the `values` list. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, so we cannot determine the exact index being modified or the value being assigned. Therefore, we can only update the state to reflect the change in the `values` list at the `i`-th index.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is a list with the `i`-th element set to `i`; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to `0`; `total` is 0**.
