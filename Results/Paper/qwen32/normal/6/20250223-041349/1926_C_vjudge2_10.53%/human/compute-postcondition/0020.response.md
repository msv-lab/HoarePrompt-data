The code `values[i] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the `i`-th index of the `values` list. Given that `i` is 10, the 10th index of the `values` list will now be set to 10.

The other variables (`t`, `numbers`, `sum_values`, `total`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers; `values` is a list with the `i`-th element set to `i` (specifically, `values[10]` is 10); `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to `0` except the `i`-th element which is `i`; `total` is `i`; `i` is 10**.
