The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 after the decrement.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, decremented by 1; `numbers` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `n`; `n` is the new input integer.**

After the decrement, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 1. Therefore, before the decrement, `t` must have been at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `n`; `n` is the new input integer.**

Since `t` is decremented at the start of the loop, we need to reflect that in the state before the decrement:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `n`; `n` is the new input integer.**
