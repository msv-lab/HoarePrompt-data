Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9 and `values[10]` is 1, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[10]` is 46, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 11, `word` is `"11"`, `last` is `0`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is 46, `i` is 11**.

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated to `"11"` because the code assigns the string representation of `i` to `word`. All other variables retain their initial values.
