The code snippet assigns the value of `sum_total` to `sum_values[i]`. Given the initial state, `sum_total` is 48 and `i` is 11. Therefore, `sum_values[11]` will be updated to 48. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list with the first 10 elements set to 0 through 9, `values[10]` is 1, and `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and `sum_values[10]` is 46, `sum_values[11]` is 48, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 11, `word` is `"11"`, `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 48, `i` is 11**.
