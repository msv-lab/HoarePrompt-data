Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `q` is equal to `t`; `s` is the last string provided by the user input; `ac` is the count of 'A's in `s`; `bc` is the count of non-'A' characters in `s`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` is greater than `bc`; otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.**
