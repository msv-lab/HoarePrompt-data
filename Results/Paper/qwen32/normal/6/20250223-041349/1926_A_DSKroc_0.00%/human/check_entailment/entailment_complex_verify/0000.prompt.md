You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `ac` is the count of 'A's in the last string `s`; `bc` is the count of non-'A' characters in the last string `s`; `s` is the last string provided by the user input; `q` is equal to `t`.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `q` is equal to `t`; `s` is the last string provided by the user input; `ac` is the count of 'A's in `s`; `bc` is the count of non-'A' characters in `s`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` is greater than `bc`; otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a distinct string of length 5 containing only the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. After processing all test cases, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A's in the last string is greater than the count of 'B's; otherwise, it prints 'B'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description because it does not print the result for each test case individually. Instead, it accumulates the counts of 'A' and 'B' across all test cases and then prints the result only once after processing all test cases. This means that the program will only output the result based on the combined counts of all test cases, which is not the intended behavior.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
AAAAA
BBBBB
```
The program will count 5 'A's and 5 'B's in total and then print 'B' (since the comparison `if ac > bc` is not true, it defaults to printing 'B'). However, the correct output should be:
```
A
B
```
Each test case should be handled independently, and the result should be printed for each one. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
