The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the string `s`. According to the loop, `i` will take the next character in the string `s` in each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the next character in the string after the current `i`.

Given that `i` is the next character in the string `s` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to move to the subsequent character in the string for the next iteration. The variables `t`, `s`, `ac`, and `bc` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`. If `i` is 'A', `ac` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bc` is incremented by 1.**
