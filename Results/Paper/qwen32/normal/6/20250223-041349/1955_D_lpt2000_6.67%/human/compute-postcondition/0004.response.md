The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list called `bb`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `nabors`, and `aa` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^6, `nabors` is greater than or equal to 1, `aa` is a list of integers read from the input, `bb` is a list of integers read from the input.**
