Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `nabors` is `nabors - 1` and greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that `0 < m < n`, `aa` is a list of integers with length `n`, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then if `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1; otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1. In both cases, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was 0, and `tot` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `tot` remains unchanged. If `C[in_aa]` is 0, `D[out_aa]` and `tot` remain unchanged, and `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. `fnd` is 1 if `tot >= k` else 0.**
