The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `aa`. The values of `t`, `nabors`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` (unchanged), `nabors` must be greater than the current iteration count, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `aa` is a list of integers from the input.**
