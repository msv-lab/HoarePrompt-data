The code snippet provided is reading three integers from the input and assigning them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state mentions that `n`, `m`, and `k` are already defined with specific constraints. However, the code overwrites these variables with new values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

In simpler terms, `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated to the values provided in the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.
