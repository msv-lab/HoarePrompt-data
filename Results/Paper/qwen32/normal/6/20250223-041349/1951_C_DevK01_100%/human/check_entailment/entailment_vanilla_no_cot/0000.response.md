Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the logic used to calculate the minimum cost of purchasing the tickets. The program's approach does not accurately account for the increasing prices after each purchase and does not ensure that the minimum cost is achieved.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Sorting and Selection**: The program sorts the prices and selects the lowest `q` prices, where `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. This does not guarantee that the minimum cost is achieved because the prices increase after each purchase, and the program does not take this into account dynamically.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic is flawed. It does not correctly account for the increased prices after each purchase. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the cost does not reflect the cumulative increase in prices due to previous purchases.

3. **Handling Remaining Tickets**: The program incorrectly handles the remaining tickets after the initial `q` purchases. The logic for calculating the cost of the remaining tickets does not account for the increasing prices correctly.

To solve this problem correctly, a more dynamic approach is needed, such as using a priority queue (min-heap) to always purchase tickets from the day with the currently lowest price, taking into account the cumulative price increases due to previous purchases.

Here's a corrected version of the program using a priority queue:

```python
import heapq

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Create a min-heap of the prices
        heapq.heapify(prices)
        
        total_cost = 0
        increase = 0
        
        while k > 0:
            # Get the smallest price available
            price = heapq.heappop(prices) + increase
            
            # Determine how many tickets to buy on this day
            to_buy = min(m, k)
            
            # Add the cost to the total
            total_cost += to_buy * price
            
            # Increase the price for future days
            increase += to_buy
            
            # Decrease the number of tickets left to buy
            k -= to_buy
        
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected program uses a priority queue to always purchase tickets from the day with the currently lowest price, taking into account the cumulative price increases due to previous purchases. This ensures that the minimum cost is achieved.
