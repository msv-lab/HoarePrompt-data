Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day (`m`), the total number of tickets to be bought (`k`), and a list of prices for each day. It calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day.**
