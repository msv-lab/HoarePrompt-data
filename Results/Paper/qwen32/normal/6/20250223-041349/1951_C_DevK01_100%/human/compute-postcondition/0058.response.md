Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. Here, `n` represents the number of sale days, `m` the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day, and `k` the total number of tickets to be bought. The list `a` contains the price per ticket for each of the `n` days. The function returns the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day. If it is not possible to buy `k` tickets given the constraints, the function should return an appropriate indication (such as -1 or an error message).**
