The code snippet assigns the values of `L[0]`, `L[1]`, and `L[2]` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `L` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `M` is the new list of integers read from the input.
- `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`.
- `k` is `L[2]`.
- `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.
- If `n * m == k`, then `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is `M[:q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

After the code snippet executes:
- `n` is assigned the value of `L[0]`.
- `m` is assigned the value of `L[1]`.
- `k` is assigned the value of `L[2]`.

The values of `t`, `L`, `M`, and the expressions for `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` remain as they were defined in the initial state, but `m` and `k` are now specifically assigned the values of `L[1]` and `L[2]` respectively.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `L` is a new list of integers read from the input; `M` is the new list of integers read from the input; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is `L[1]`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is `M[:q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
