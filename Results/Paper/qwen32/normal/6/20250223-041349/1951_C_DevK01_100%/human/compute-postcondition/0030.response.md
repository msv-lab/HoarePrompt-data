The code snippet provided updates the value of the `cost` variable based on the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged unless directly affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `L` is a new list of integers read from the input; `M` is the new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `n` is the length of `N`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.

In simple terms, the `cost` variable is now calculated using the new formula provided in the code snippet, while all other variables retain their previously assigned values.
