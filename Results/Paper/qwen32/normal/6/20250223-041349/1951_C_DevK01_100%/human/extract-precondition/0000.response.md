Precondition: **Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets that can be purchased each day, and the total number of tickets to be bought, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
