The value of `m` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `k`. The values of `t`, `L`, `M`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` is a list of integers; `M` is a list of integers; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`.**
