The provided code snippet updates the `cost` variable based on a specific formula. The formula used in the code is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This formula is applied regardless of the condition `n * m == k` because the code snippet only includes the `if` part of the condition.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input
- `M` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order
- `n` is `len(N)`
- `m` is `min(m, k)`
- `k` is `L[2]`
- `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`
- `N` is `M[:q]`
- `w` is `M[q-1]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop
- `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`
- `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`

After executing the code snippet:
- The `cost` variable is recalculated using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `M` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]`; `w` is `M[q-1]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

In simpler terms, the `cost` is now recalculated using the specified formula, and all other variables retain their previous values.
