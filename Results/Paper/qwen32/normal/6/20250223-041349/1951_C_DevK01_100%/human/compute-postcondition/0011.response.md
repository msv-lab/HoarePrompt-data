The code calculates the value of `cost` based on the given variables and assigns it to the variable `cost`. The other variables remain unchanged.

The calculation for `cost` is:
\[ \text{cost} = m \times \text{sum}(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) \]

Given:
- \( n \) is the length of \( M[:q] \)
- \( m \) is \( \min(L[1], L[2]) \)
- \( k \) is \( L[2] \)
- \( q \) is \( \lceil \frac{k}{m} \rceil \)
- \( N \) is \( M[:q] \)
- \( n \times m = k \)

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` is a list of integers; `M` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is the length of `M[:q]`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**
