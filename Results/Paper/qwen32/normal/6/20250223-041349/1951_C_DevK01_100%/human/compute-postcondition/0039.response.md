The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 and still be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to be `t - 1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `M` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is `M[q-1]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `n` is the length of `N`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
