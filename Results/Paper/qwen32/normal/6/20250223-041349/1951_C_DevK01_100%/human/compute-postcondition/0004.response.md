The code snippet assigns the first, second, and third elements of the list `L` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `L` and `M` are lists of integers. After the assignment, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are set to the corresponding elements of `L`. The values of `t` and `M` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` is a list of integers; `M` is a list of integers; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is `L[1]`; `k` is `L[2]`.**
