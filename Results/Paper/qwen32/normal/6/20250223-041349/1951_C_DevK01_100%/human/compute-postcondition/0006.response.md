The code snippet `M.sort()` sorts the list `M` in ascending order. This operation affects the list `M` but does not change the values of `t`, `L`, `n`, `m`, or `k`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` is a list of integers; `M` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`.**

In natural language: The list `M` is now sorted in ascending order, while the other variables `t`, `L`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
