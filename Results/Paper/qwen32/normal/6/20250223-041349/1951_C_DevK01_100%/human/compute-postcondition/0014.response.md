The variable `mu` is assigned the value of `k - (n - 1) * m`. The values of `t`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `w` remain unchanged as per the given initial state. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` is a list of integers; `M` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is the length of `M[:q-1]`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**
