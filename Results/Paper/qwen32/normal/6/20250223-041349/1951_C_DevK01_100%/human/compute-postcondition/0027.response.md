The given code snippet only updates the value of `q`. The new value of `q` is calculated as `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `L` is a new list of integers read from the input; `M` is the new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; if `n * m == k`, then `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, otherwise `N` is `M[:q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
