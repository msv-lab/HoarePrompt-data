In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the range `t`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`) are defined within the loop body and do not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
