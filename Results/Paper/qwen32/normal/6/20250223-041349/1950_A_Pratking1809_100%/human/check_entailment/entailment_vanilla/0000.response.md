Reasoning:
The given problem requires us to determine if three given digits form a "stair," a "peak," or neither. The conditions for these are clearly defined as:
- A "stair" is when the digits satisfy the condition a < b < c.
- A "peak" is when the digits satisfy the condition a < b > c.
- If neither of these conditions is met, the digits form "NONE."

The provided program follows these requirements step-by-step:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits.
3. It then checks if the digits form a "stair" using the condition `a < b < c`.
4. If the first condition is not met, it checks if the digits form a "peak" using the condition `a < b > c`.
5. If neither of the conditions is satisfied, it outputs "NONE".

The program correctly uses logical conditions to determine the output and handles all possible cases as per the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
