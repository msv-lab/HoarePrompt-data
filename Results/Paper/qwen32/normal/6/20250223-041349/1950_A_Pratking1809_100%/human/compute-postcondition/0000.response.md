The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `q`. The initial state includes `t` as an integer within a specific range and `a`, `b`, and `c` as integers within another specific range. The variable `q` is introduced and assigned the value of the integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `q` is an input integer.**
