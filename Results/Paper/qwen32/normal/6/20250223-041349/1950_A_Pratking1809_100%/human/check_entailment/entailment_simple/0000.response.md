Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Input Reading**: The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases. This aligns with the problem statement where the first line of input is the number of test cases.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `q` times, where each iteration corresponds to a single test case. This matches the requirement that there are `t` test cases to process.

3. **Reading Values for Each Test Case**: Inside the loop, for each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. This correctly parses the input as three space-separated integers, which matches the problem's specification.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR", which is correct according to the problem description.
   - Next, it checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK", which is also correct.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE", which is the correct response for the remaining cases.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Given the provided input-output example, the program's behavior matches the expected results, further confirming its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
