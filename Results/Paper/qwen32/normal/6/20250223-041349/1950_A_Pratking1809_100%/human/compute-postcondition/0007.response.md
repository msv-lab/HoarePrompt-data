The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print('PEAK')`. This statement prints the string 'PEAK' directly, regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i`.

Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

However, none of these variables or their values affect the `print('PEAK')` statement because the string 'PEAK' is hardcoded in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **PEAK**
