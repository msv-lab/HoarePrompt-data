Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `ans` is Decimal('Infinity').**

In this output state, the only change is that a new variable `ans` has been introduced and assigned the value `Decimal('Infinity')`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
