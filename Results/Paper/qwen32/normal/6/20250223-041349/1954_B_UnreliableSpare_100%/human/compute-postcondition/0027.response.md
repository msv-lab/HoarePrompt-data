The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` can either be 1 or 0 depending on the condition `if arr[i] == val`. After the increment, `cnt` will be either 2 or 1.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`, `i`, `ans`) are not modified by the code snippet, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `val` is the first element of `arr`; `i` is 1; If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'). Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 0.**
