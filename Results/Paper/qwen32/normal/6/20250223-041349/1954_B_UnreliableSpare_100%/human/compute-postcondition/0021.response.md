Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'); `val` is the first element of `arr`; `cnt` is 1; `i` is 0; `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**

In this output state, the variable `cnt` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
