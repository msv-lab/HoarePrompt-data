The given code snippet is `ans = min(ans, cnt)`. Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is initially `Decimal('Infinity')` if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `ans` is `0`.
- `cnt` is initially `1` if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `cnt` is `0`.

Given this, the `min` function will compare `ans` and `cnt` and update `ans` to the smaller of the two values.

- If `ans` was initially `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` is `1`, then `ans` will be updated to `1`.
- If `ans` was initially `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` is `0`, then `ans` will be updated to `0`.
- If `ans` was initially `0` and `cnt` is `1`, then `ans` will remain `0`.
- If `ans` was initially `0` and `cnt` is `0`, then `ans` will remain `0`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum of its initial value and `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `val` is the first element of `arr`; `i` is 1; If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of `0` and `cnt`.**
