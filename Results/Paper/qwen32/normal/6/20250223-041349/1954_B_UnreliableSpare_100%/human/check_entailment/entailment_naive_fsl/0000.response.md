Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The program incorrectly handles certain cases, particularly when there are multiple segments of different elements in the array.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Elements to Remove**:
   - The program calculates the minimum length of a contiguous segment of the same elements (`ans = min(ans, cnt)`). This is not necessarily the correct approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty of the array.
   - For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program will find the minimum segment length as `1` (for the `5`), but removing just the `5` does not make the array stop being beautiful. Instead, you need to remove at least three `3`s to break the beauty.

2. **Handling of Uniform Arrays**:
   - The program correctly identifies uniform arrays (where all elements are the same) and returns `-1` as expected. However, the logic for non-uniform arrays is flawed.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the input:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

- The program will output `1` because it identifies the segment of `5` as the shortest segment.
- However, removing just the `5` does not make the array stop being beautiful. The correct answer should be `3`, as removing any three `3`s will break the beauty of the array.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider all possible ways to break the array's beauty by removing the minimum number of elements. This involves more complex logic to evaluate different segments and their removal impacts.

Given the above issues, the program is incorrect.
