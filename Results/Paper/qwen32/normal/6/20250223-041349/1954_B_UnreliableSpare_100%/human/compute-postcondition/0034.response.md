The code snippet `cnt = 0` sets the value of `cnt` to 0. This change does not affect any other variables or conditions provided in the initial state. The other variables such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `val` is the first element of `arr`; `i` is 2; `cnt` is 0; If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
