The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `arr`. This operation changes the value of `arr` but does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
