The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains True.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be 2, and `n` must remain the same because it is the upper bound of the loop.
