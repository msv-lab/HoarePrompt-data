To determine the output, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `t` is unchanged. (This detail does not affect the `ans` or `flag` variables, so we can ignore it for this task.)
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
- `flag` is `False`.

The print statement:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is described as the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. However, the exact value of `ans` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. All we know is that `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
- The variable `flag` is `False`, but this does not affect what is printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

Since we don't have the explicit value of `ans` or `cnt`, the most precise description we can provide is that `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum of its previous value and cnt)**
