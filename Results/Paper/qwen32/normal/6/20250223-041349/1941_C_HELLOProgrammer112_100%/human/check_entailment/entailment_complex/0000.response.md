Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and then subtracting the occurrences of the substring "mapie". However, this approach is incorrect because it does not accurately determine the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful. The program does not account for overlapping substrings and does not consider the optimal way to remove characters to avoid the substrings "map" and "pie".

For example, consider the test case "mappppie". The program would count 1 occurrence of "map", 1 occurrence of "pie", and 0 occurrences of "mapie", resulting in a total of 2 characters to remove. However, the optimal solution is to remove only 2 characters (the 'm' and 'p' in "map") to make the string beautiful, resulting in "pppie", which still contains "pie". A correct solution would involve a dynamic programming approach or some other method to ensure that the minimum number of deletions is calculated.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
