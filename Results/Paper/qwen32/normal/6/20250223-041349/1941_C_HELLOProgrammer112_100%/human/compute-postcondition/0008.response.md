The code snippet `a = int(input())` changes the value of the variable `a` to the integer value provided by the user input. Other variables (`t`, `s`, `x`, `y`, `z`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the integer value provided by the user input; `s` is an input string; `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in `s`; `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in `s`; `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.**
