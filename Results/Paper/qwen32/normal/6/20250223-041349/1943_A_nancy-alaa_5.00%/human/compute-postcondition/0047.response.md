Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `first` is a boolean set to True.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that represents the counts of each element in `arr`.
- `mpp[i]` is equal to 1, which means the count of the element `i` (which is 0) in the list `arr` is 1.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly initialized to 0, the `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
