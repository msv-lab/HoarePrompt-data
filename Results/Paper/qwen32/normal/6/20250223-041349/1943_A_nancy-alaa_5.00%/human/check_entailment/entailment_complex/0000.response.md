### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally on the array `a`. Here's a breakdown of the optimal strategies:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX. She should aim to add the highest possible numbers to `c` while ensuring that the smallest possible numbers are left for Bob to remove.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX. He should aim to remove the smallest possible numbers from `a` to keep the MEX low.

The key insight is that the game's final score (MEX) is determined by the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c`. If a number appears more than once in `a`, Bob can always remove one of those duplicates, so they don't affect the MEX. The critical numbers are those that appear exactly once.

Here's the logic of the provided code:
- It counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using `Counter`.
- It then iterates through numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- If a number does not appear in `a` (`i not in mpp.keys()`), it is the MEX.
- If a number appears exactly once and it's the first such number (`mpp[i] == 1`), it is a candidate for the MEX.

The code correctly identifies the smallest integer that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once, which aligns with the optimal strategies of both players.

### Correctness:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
