To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n)`. This means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is the loop index, which is automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` before the loop starts, as it will be set correctly by the `range` function.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that the loop can execute. The variables `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`, `first` is `False`**
