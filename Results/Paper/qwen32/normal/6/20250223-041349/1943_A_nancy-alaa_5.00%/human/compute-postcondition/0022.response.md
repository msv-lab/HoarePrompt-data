Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains `i + 1`, and the condition `n` is greater than `i` still holds true. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of `i` or `n`.
