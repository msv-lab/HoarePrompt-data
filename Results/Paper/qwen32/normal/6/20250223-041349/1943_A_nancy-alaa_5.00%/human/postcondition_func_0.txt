The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it identifies and prints the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that either does not appear in the list or appears exactly once, ensuring that if multiple such integers exist, the smallest one is chosen.
