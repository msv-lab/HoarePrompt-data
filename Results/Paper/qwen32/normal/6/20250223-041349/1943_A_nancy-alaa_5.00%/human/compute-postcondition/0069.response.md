The code snippet sets the variable `first` to `True`. This change affects the state of `first`, while the other variables (`i`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `first` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, and `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`.**
