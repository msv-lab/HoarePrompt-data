Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0 (though `n` is not used in the print statement, it provides context).
- `first` is False (though `first` is not used in the print statement, it provides context).
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is not a key in `mpp` (though this fact is not relevant to the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

Given that `i` is explicitly stated to be 0, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **0**
