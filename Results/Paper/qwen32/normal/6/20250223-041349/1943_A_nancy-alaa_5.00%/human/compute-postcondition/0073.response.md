The value of `n` is now assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` is updated to whatever integer value is provided by the user input. The other variables `i`, `first`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once, otherwise False, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is unchanged, `mpp` is unchanged**.
