The code snippet `total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy` updates the `total_cost` by adding the product of `price` and `tickets_to_buy` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` must be greater than `tickets_bought`, `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with one less element; `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy` plus `price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k)`; `price_increase` is `price_increase + min(m, k)`; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list; `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`**

In simpler terms: The `total_cost` has been updated to include the cost of buying `tickets_to_buy` tickets at the current `price`. All other variables remain the same.
