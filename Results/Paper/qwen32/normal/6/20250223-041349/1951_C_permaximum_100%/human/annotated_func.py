#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), and prices is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with some elements popped; `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of all tickets bought, considering the increasing price; `tickets_bought` is `k`; `price_increase` is the total number of tickets bought.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns total_cost, which is the sum of the costs of all tickets bought, considering the increasing price.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, given `n` ticket prices, a maximum of `m` tickets that can be bought on a single day, and an increasing price for each ticket bought.
