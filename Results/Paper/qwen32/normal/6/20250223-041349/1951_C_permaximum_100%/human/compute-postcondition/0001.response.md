The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function transforms the list `pq` into a heap in-place. This means that the list `pq` will now satisfy the heap property, where for each index `i` in the list, the element at index `i` is less than or equal to the elements at indices `2*i + 1` and `2*i + 2` (its children in the heap).

The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The `prices` list also remains unchanged. The only change is that `pq` is now a heap.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), and `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list.**
