Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` must be greater than `tickets_bought`, `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with one less element; `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k)`; `price_increase` is `price_increase + min(m, k)`; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list; `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k)`.**

In natural language: The value of `price` has been increased by `price_increase`. All other variables remain unchanged.
