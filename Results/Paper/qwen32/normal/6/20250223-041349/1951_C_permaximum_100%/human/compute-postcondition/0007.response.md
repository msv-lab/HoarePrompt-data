The code snippet `price += price_increase` modifies the value of the variable `price` by adding the value of `price_increase` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` and `price_increase` is 0, the value of `price` will not change in this specific case.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with one less element; `total_cost` is 0; `tickets_bought` is 0; `price_increase` is 0; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list.**
