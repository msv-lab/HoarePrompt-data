Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in us:
        win.add(i)
        if len(win) == k:
            ans.append(i)
            ps += 1
            win.clear()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `i` is an element of `us`. If `i` is not already in `win`, `win` contains the element `i` and `ans` and `ps` remain unchanged. If `i` is already in `win`, `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` is updated to contain the single element `i`, and `ps` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If `i` is in `us`, then `win` is a set that contains the character `i`. If `len(win) == k`, `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` is a list that contains the character `i`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`. If `i` is not in `us`, no changes are made to any variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If `i` is in `us`, `win` is a set containing the character `i`. If `len(win) == k`, `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the character `i`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `win` remains unchanged. If `i` is not in `us`, no changes are made to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
