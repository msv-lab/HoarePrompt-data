Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i`; `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 0; `i` is an element of `us`.**

In this output state, the variable `win` now contains the element `i`, which was previously an empty set. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
