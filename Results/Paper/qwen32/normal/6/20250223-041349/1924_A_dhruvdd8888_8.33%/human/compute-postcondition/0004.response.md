The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `ans`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables while `ans` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list.**
