Let's analyze the given program step by step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. For each test case, we need to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the string `s`.
2. If all such strings are subsequences of `s`, we print "YES".
3. If not, we print "NO" and provide an example of a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
    - For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Set of Usable Characters**:
    - The program creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

3. **Checking for Subsequences**:
    - The program initializes an empty set `win` to keep track of the characters seen in the current window.
    - It iterates through the string `s` and adds characters to `win` if they are in `us`.
    - If `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the current character to `ans` and clears `win`.
    - It increments `ps` each time a full set of `k` characters is found in `s`.
    - If `ps` is at least `n`, it prints "YES" and returns.

4. **Generating a Missing Subsequence**:
    - If `ps` is less than `n`, it prints "NO".
    - It then attempts to construct a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.
    - The logic here is flawed. The program tries to append characters from `us` that are not in `win` to `ans`, but this approach does not guarantee that the constructed string will not be a subsequence of `s`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic to generate a string that is not a subsequence of `s` is incorrect. The program's approach to appending characters from `us` that are not in `win` does not ensure that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.
- The program does not consider the order and combination of characters required to form a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` when `ps` is less than `n`.

**Correctness: False**
