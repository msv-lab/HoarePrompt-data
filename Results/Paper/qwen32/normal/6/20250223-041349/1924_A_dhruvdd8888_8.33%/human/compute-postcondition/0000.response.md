The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts these parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**
