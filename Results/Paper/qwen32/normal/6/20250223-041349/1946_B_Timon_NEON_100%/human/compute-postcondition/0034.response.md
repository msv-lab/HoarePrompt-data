Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment` has its first element increased by `arr[i]` and `new_segment` is an empty list. Otherwise, `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` are each increased by `arr[i]`. `segments_variants` remains the same.**
