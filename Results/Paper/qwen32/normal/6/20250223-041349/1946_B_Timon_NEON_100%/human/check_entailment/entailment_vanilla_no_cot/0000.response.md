Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incomplete and does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Function `func_3` is incomplete**: The function `func_3` is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, but it is not implemented. It currently just initializes `answer` to 0 and does nothing else.

2. **Main logic missing**: The main logic to compute the maximum sum after `k` operations is missing. The problem requires finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray (which can be done using Kadane's algorithm), and then using that sum to compute the result after `k` operations.

3. **Handling multiple test cases**: Although the code defines functions, it does not include any mechanism to process multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

4. **Modulo operation**: The code includes a function `func_1` to apply modulo `10^9 + 7`, but this function is not used anywhere in the provided code.

Here is a brief outline of how the solution should look:

1. **Read input**: Read the number of test cases and for each test case, read `n`, `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Find the maximum subarray sum**: Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the array `a`.

3. **Compute the result**: The maximum possible sum after `k` operations is the sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum added `k` times. This is because the best strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum subarray sum to the array.

4. **Apply modulo**: Since the result can be very large, apply the modulo `10^9 + 7` to the final result.

5. **Output the result**: For each test case, output the computed result.

Here is a possible implementation:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0
    for x in arr:
        max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

def max_possible_sum(n, k, arr):
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    max_subarray = max_subarray_sum(arr)
    return (total_sum + max_subarray * k) % MOD

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        k = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        arr = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(max_possible_sum(n, k, arr))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation reads the input, computes the maximum possible sum for each test case, and prints the results.
