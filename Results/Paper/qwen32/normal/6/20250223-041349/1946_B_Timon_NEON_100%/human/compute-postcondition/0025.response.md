The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is pointing to the current element being processed, and for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than the length of `arr`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given:
- `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
- `i` is the loop variable.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was pointing to the current element being processed. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1**.

We do not need to adjust the states of `new_segment`, `max_segment`, or `segments_variants` as they are not part of the loop head.
