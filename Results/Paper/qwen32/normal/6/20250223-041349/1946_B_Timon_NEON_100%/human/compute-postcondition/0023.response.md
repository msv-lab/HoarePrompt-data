Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list. `max_segment` is now `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], max_segment[1]]`, `segments_variants` remains an empty list, and `max_sum` remains -1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `max_segment[0]` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
