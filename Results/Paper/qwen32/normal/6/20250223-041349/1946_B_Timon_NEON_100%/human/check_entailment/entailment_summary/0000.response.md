### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and see if it meets the problem description correctly.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, which are the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `n`.

2. **Key Function: `func_2`**
   - `func_2` is supposed to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in `a` and return it along with the start and end indices.
   - This function seems to implement a variant of Kadane's algorithm, which is used to find the maximum sum subarray in linear time.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the logic. The function does not correctly handle cases where all elements are negative. It initializes `max_sum` to -1 and does not correctly update `max_segment` when encountering negative numbers. This could lead to incorrect results for arrays with all negative numbers.
   - Another issue is that the function does not handle the case where `new_segment` is empty correctly. If the array starts with a negative number, `new_segment` never gets initialized, and the function might return an incorrect result.

3. **Calculation of the Answer:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - It multiplies the maximum segment sum by `2 ** k` and adds it to the total sum of the array minus the maximum segment sum.
   - This logic is based on the idea that the optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum subarray sum to the array, considering the effect of the operations.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `func_1`, which is correct.

5. **Function `func_3`:**
   - `func_3` is not used in the provided code snippet, and it seems to be incomplete. It is not relevant to the current problem.

### Conclusion:
The primary issue lies in `func_2`, which does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when all elements in the array are negative. This can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
