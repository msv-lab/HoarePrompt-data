The code snippet `new_segment = []` simply initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `max_segment`, or `segments_variants`. The conditions and relationships between these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `max_segment` remains the same, `segments_variants` remains the same, `new_segment` is an empty list.**
