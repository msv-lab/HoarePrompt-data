The code creates a new list `new_segment` with the first element being `arr[i]` and the second element being `i`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` are not changed by this operation. The variable `new_segment` is introduced with the specified values.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]`**.
