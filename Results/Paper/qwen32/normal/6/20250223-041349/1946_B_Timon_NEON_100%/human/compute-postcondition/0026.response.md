The code snippet appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is composed of the elements in `max_segment` followed by `i - 1`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `segments_variants` has a new list appended which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`**.
