### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine the correctness of the solution.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(number)`**
   - This function correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **Annotation:** The function returns the remainder of `number` divided by \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct.
   - **Conclusion:** Correct.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(arr)`**
   - This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray in the given array `arr`.
   - **Annotation:** The function iterates through the array to keep track of the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray and returns the subarray with the maximum sum.
   - **Issues Identified:**
     - **Initialization:** `max_segment` and `new_segment` are initialized with `[0, 0]`, which is incorrect. They should be initialized with the sum and index of the first non-negative element.
     - **Updating Logic:** The logic for updating `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly handle cases where the maximum sum subarray ends at the last element of the array.
     - **Negative Elements:** The function does not handle cases where all elements are negative correctly.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect due to improper initialization and updating logic.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic uses `func_2` to find the maximum sum subarray.
   - It then calculates the answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - **Annotation:** The state of `arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `total_max_segment` is shown, and the function returns the correct maximum sum subarray.
   - **Issues Identified:**
     - **Incorrect Maximum Subarray Calculation:** Since `func_2` is incorrect, the maximum subarray sum it returns is incorrect.
     - **Formula Misuse:** The formula used to calculate the answer assumes that the maximum subarray sum is correctly identified, which is not the case.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect due to the incorrect maximum subarray sum and misuse of the formula.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`**
   - **Annotation:** The function is incomplete and does not perform any operations.
   - **Conclusion:** Irrelevant and incomplete.

#### Conclusion:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.
- `func_2` is incorrect due to improper initialization and updating logic.
- The main logic uses an incorrect maximum subarray sum, leading to incorrect results.
- `func_3` is incomplete and does not contribute to the solution.
