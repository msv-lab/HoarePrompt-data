The code snippet provided increments the first element of the `new_segment` list by the value of `arr[i]`. The values of `arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, and `max_segment[0]` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `new_segment[0]` is `new_segment[0] + arr[i]`.**

In natural language: The first element of `new_segment` is increased by the value of `arr[i]`. The values of `arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, and `max_segment[0]` remain the same.
