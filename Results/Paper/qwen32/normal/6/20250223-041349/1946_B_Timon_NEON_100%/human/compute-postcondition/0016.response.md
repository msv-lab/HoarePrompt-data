The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of the `max_segment` list by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. 

Given that `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment[0]` will be increased by a non-negative value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the current element `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
