The given code modifies `max_segment[0]` by adding the current element of `arr` at index `i` to it. Since `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` will decrease in value.

The other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_sum`, `max_segment[1]`, `segments_variants`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

The Output State is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the current element of `arr` at index `i` is less than 0. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` is `[[max_segment[0], max_segment[1], i - 1]]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is `[[new_segment[0], new_segment[1], i - 1]]`. `max_segment[0]` is now `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`.**
