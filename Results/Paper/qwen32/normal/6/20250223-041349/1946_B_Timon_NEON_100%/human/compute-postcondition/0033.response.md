The code snippet `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` increments the value of `new_segment[0]` by the value of `arr[i]`. The values of `arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, and `max_segment[0]` remain unchanged except for `new_segment[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `max_segment[0]` is the original value of `max_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`, `new_segment[0]` is the original value of `new_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `new_segment[0]` is increased by the value of `arr[i]`, while all other variables retain their original values.
