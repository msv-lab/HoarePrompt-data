The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`, which is the concatenation of `new_segment` and a list containing `i - 1`. This means the last element of the new list in `segments_variants` will be `i - 1`.

Given that `segments_variants` was initially an empty list, after this operation, it will contain one list, which is `new_segment + [i - 1]`.

The other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Specifically:
- `arr` is still a list of integers with at least one element.
- `new_segment` is still a non-empty list.
- `max_segment` is still `[0, 0]`.
- `max_sum` is still `-1`.
- The condition that the current element of `arr` at index `i` is less than 0 remains true.
- The condition that `max_segment[0]` is less than or equal to `new_segment[0]` remains true.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1, and the current element of `arr` at index `i` is less than 0. Additionally, `max_segment[0]` is less than or equal to `new_segment[0]`.**
