Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, and if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` has a new list appended to it, which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is updated to include a new segment which is `new_segment` with an additional element `i - 1` appended to it, and `max_segment` is now equal to `new_segment`.**

In simpler terms, the value of the first element of `max_segment` has been increased by the value of `arr[i]`. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values, except for `max_segment[0]` which has been updated.
