Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element. `new_segment` is either an empty list or a non-empty list where `new_segment[0]` is the sum of its previous value and `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]` before `arr[i]` was added, `segments_variants` is `[[max_segment[0], max_segment[1], i - 1]]`; otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is `[[new_segment[0], new_segment[1], i - 1]]`. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], 0]` and `segments_variants` remains an empty list. `max_sum` is -1.**
