The code snippet appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is composed of `new_segment` with an additional element, which is `i - 1`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `i` is `i + 1`; `max_sum` remains -1; `segments_variants` is updated to include a new segment which is `new_segment` with an additional element `i - 1` appended to it.**
