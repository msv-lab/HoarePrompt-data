The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` adds the value of `arr[i]` to the first element of the list `max_segment`. Given that `i` is `i + 1` and `max_sum` remains -1, the only variable that changes is `max_segment[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `max_segment[0]` is the original value of `max_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`.**
