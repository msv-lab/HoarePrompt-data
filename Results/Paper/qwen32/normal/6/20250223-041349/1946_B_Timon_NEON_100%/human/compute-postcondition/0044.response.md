The code snippet provided initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. This action does not affect any other variables listed in the initial state. The initial state specifies conditions and relationships between variables, but since `new_segment` is just being initialized here, the other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, and if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` has a new list appended to it, which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is updated to include a new segment which is `new_segment` with an additional element `i - 1` appended to it, and `max_segment` is now equal to `new_segment`.**
