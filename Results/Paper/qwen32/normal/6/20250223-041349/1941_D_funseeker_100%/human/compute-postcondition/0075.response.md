Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by the last call to `func_3()`. `m` is 0, `ans` contains all the results of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` (or just `(q + r) % n` if `c` was '0') for all elements `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration, except that if `0` was in `ans`, it is now removed and `n` is added to `ans`. `r` and `c` are the values from the last call to `func_1()`, and `temp` is an empty set.**
