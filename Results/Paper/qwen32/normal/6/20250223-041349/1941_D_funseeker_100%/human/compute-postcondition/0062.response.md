The code snippet adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given that `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` if `c` was '0', or both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` was '1' or '?', the addition of `(q - r) % n` will only change the state if `c` was initially '0'.

Output State: **`n`, `m` (which is `m - 1` and still greater than 0), and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. `ans` is a set containing at least two values. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is either '0' or '?'. If `c` was '0', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` was '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**

In simpler terms:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` retain their initial values as returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` remains a set containing at least two values.
- `r` retains its value as an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `c` retains its value, which is either '0' or '?'.
- `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, regardless of the initial value of `c`.
