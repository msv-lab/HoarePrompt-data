The code snippet converts the string `r` to an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are not affected by this operation as they are assigned values from `func_3()`. The variable `ans` remains an empty set, and `temp` also remains an empty set. The variable `c` is not affected by this operation. The only change is that `r` is now an integer.

Output State: **`n`, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`; `ans` is an empty set; `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`; `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`; `temp` is an empty set.**
