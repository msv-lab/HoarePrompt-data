The only variable in the loop head is `q`, which iterates over the elements of the set `ans`. For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, and `temp`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

Given the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we need to ensure that `ans` is not empty.

State: **`n`, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`; `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`; `temp` is an empty set**
