The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`, which is the result of `(q - r) % n`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`) are not modified by this code snippet.

Given that `temp` initially contains the value `(q + r) % n`, after the code executes, `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
