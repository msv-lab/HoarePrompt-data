Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`.**
