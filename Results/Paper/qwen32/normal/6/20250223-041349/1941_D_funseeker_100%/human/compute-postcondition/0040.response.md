Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0', '1', nor '?', `temp` remains an empty set. `q` is an element from `ans` that hasn't been iterated over yet.**
