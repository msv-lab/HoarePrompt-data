To determine the output of the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement, we need to break down the given initial state and understand how the `ans` list is constructed and modified.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`, `m`, `x`**: These are the values returned by the last call to `func_3()`. However, the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are not provided, so we will refer to them by their names.
2. **`m`**: It is explicitly stated that `m` is `0`.
3. **`ans`**: This list contains results of the following operations:
   - For each element `q` in the original `ans`, compute `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is not '0'.
   - If `c` is '0', compute only `(q + r) % n`.
   - If `0` is in the resulting `ans`, remove `0` and add `n` to `ans`.
4. **`r` and `c`**: These are values returned by the last call to `func_1()`. Again, their specific values are not provided, so we will refer to them by their names.
5. **`temp`**: An empty set, which is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.

### Deriving the Output:
Given the operations performed on `ans`:
- Each element `q` in the original `ans` is transformed based on the operations involving `r` and `c`.
- The result might include additional values if `0` was present in the original `ans` (which is removed and replaced by `n`).

Since the exact values of `n`, `r`, and `c` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output Description:
- The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the sorted values of the modified `ans` list.
- The elements of `ans` are derived from the original `ans` list by applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` (or just `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0').
- If `0` was in the original `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to `ans`.

### Final Output:
Output: **sorted values of the modified `ans` list (where each element is derived from the original `ans` list by applying `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is not '0', or just `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', and `0` is replaced by `n` if present)**
