The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given that `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', the new value `(q + r) % n` will be added to `temp` if it is not already present. However, since sets do not allow duplicate values, if `(q + r) % n` is already in `temp`, the set will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is that `temp` will contain at least `(q + r) % n` and possibly `(q - r) % n` depending on the initial condition of `c`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` contains `(q + r) % n`. `q` is an element from `ans` that hasn't been iterated over yet.**
