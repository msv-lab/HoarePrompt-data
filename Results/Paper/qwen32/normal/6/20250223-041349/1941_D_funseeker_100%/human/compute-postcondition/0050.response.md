The code snippet provided is `r = int(r)`. Given the initial state, `r` is already described as an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. Therefore, the operation `r = int(r)` does not change the value of `r` since it is already an integer.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `c`, `temp`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n`, `m` is `m - 1`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', or only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is a set containing the same values as the new `ans`.**
