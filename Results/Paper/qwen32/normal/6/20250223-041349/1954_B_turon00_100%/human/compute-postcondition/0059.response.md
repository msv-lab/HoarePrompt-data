Let's break down the provided initial state to understand what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` is being decremented by 1, but since `t` is not used in the given print statement, we can ignore its value for this task.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `a` is the input list of integers.
   - `tmp` is `a[0]`: This means `tmp` holds the first element of the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of elements equal to `tmp`: This implies that `cnt` counts how many times the first element of the list `a` consecutively appears from the start.
   - `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`: This suggests that `ans` is updated to be the smaller value between its current value and `cnt`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `ans` is not equal to `n`.

3. **What we need to determine:**
   - The value of `ans` at the time of the print statement.

Given the information, we know that `ans` is the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`. However, the exact previous value of `ans` is not provided, so we can only describe `ans` in terms of the current value of `cnt`.

Since `cnt` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of elements equal to `tmp` (the first element of the list `a`), `ans` will be the minimum of its previous value and this `cnt`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum of its previous value and the length of the last contiguous sequence of elements equal to the first element of the list `a`)**
