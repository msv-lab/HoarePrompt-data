The code snippet provided sets `cnt` to 0, which overrides its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt`, and `i` is 2.**

In natural language, this means that `cnt` has been reset to 0, while all other variables retain their previously described values.
