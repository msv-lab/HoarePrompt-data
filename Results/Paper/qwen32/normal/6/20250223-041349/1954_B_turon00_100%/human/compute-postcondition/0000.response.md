The code provided takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The value of `t` represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The other variables `n` and `a` are described in the context of each test case but are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The other variables `n` and `a` remain as described in the initial state for each test case.**
