The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. This value is explicitly specified in the `print` statement and does not depend on the values of any variables or objects described in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown of the given information and the print statement:

- `t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus `n`.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `a` is the new input list of integers.
- `tmp` is `a[0]`.
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements starting from `a[0]` that are equal to `a[0]`.
- `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
- Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.

Despite the detailed description of the initial state and the variables involved, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **-1**
