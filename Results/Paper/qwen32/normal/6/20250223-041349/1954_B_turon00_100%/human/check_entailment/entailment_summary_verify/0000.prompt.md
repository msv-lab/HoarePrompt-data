You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        tmp = a[0]
        cnt = 0
        ans = n
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        if n == 1 or ans == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of contiguous sequences of equal elements in the list `a`. If the list consists of a single element or if the entire list is a single contiguous sequence, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of such sequences.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample.

The program's logic seems to be based on counting consecutive elements that are the same and then finding the smallest such segment. However, this logic does not correctly account for the conditions specified in the problem.

### Counterexample
Consider the following test case:
```
1
8
1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2
```
For this input, the array is initially beautiful because we can perform operations to make all elements the same. For instance, we can remove elements to get `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, or `[3, 3, 3, 3]`.

The program would likely output `2` because the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements is of length `2` (e.g., `[1, 1]` or `[2, 2]` or `[3, 3]`). However, the correct answer should be `4` because we need to remove four elements to stop the array from being beautiful (e.g., we can remove elements to get `[1, 2, 3, 2]` or any other combination that does not allow the described operations to make all elements the same).

### Why the Program is Incorrect
The program does not correctly handle the requirement to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the "beautiful" property. It simply finds the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements and assumes that removing elements from this segment will suffice, which is not always true.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve checking the structure of the array and determining the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` for `2 <= i <= n-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect for at least the provided counterexample. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
