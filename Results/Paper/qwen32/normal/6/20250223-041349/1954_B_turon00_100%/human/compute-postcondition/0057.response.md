Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is `t - 1` (This suggests that `t` is being decremented by 1, but the initial value of `t` is not provided, so we can ignore this for the current print statement).
2. `n` is the input integer.
3. `a` is the input list of integers.
4. `tmp` is `a[0]` (the first element of the list `a`).
5. `cnt` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of elements equal to `tmp`.
6. `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
7. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, or `ans`. The code will simply print `-1`.

### Output:
Output: **-1**
