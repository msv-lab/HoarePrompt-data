The code sets `cnt` to 0, but the values of `n`, `i_new`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `i_new`, `i` is `i_new`, and `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` still holds, except that the value of `cnt` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i_new`, `i` is `i_new`, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and 0, `cnt` is 0**.
