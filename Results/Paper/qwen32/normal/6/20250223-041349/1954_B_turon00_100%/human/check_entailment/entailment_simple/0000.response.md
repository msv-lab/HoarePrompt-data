### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. The key idea is to identify the smallest contiguous subsequence of identical elements that can be removed to disrupt the "beauty" of the array.

Let's break down the approach in the code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is the length of the array, and `a` is the array itself.
   - `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array `a`.
   - `cnt` is a counter for the length of the current contiguous sequence of identical elements.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, representing the smallest found contiguous sequence length that could potentially be removed.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element in the array, if it matches `tmp`, increment `cnt`.
   - If it does not match, update `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, then reset `cnt` to 0 and update `tmp` to the current element.
   - After the loop, perform a final check to update `ans` with the last counted sequence length.

3. **Determine the result**:
   - If `n` is 1 (the array has only one element) or `ans` equals `n` (meaning all elements in the array are identical), print `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - Otherwise, print `ans` as the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly identifies the smallest contiguous sequence of identical elements that can be removed to potentially disrupt the "beauty" of the array.
- However, there's a critical flaw in the logic: the program does not correctly handle cases where the smallest sequence could be part of a larger pattern that still allows the array to be beautiful after removal.
- For example, in the case of an array like `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the smallest sequence of identical elements is `5`, but removing it does not make the array non-beautiful because the remaining `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is still beautiful. The correct approach would involve more complex logic to ensure that removing the identified sequence truly disrupts the "beauty" of the array.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided code logic, it does not guarantee the correct solution for all cases, especially when the smallest sequence identified can still allow the array to remain beautiful after removal. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem's requirements.

### Correctness: **False**
