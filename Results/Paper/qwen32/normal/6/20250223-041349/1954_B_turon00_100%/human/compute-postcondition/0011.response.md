The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially `n` and `cnt` is `0`. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to `0` since `0` is less than `n` (assuming `n` is greater than `0`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
