Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been set to `n`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `cnt`) retain their initial values.
