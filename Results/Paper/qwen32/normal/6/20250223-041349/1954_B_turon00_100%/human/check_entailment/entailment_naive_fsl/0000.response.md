Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample.

The program's logic seems to be based on counting consecutive elements that are the same and then finding the smallest such segment. However, this logic does not correctly account for the conditions specified in the problem.

### Counterexample
Consider the following test case:
```
1
8
1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2
```
For this input, the array is initially beautiful because we can perform operations to make all elements the same. For instance, we can remove elements to get `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, or `[3, 3, 3, 3]`.

The program would likely output `2` because the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements is of length `2` (e.g., `[1, 1]` or `[2, 2]` or `[3, 3]`). However, the correct answer should be `4` because we need to remove four elements to stop the array from being beautiful (e.g., we can remove elements to get `[1, 2, 3, 2]` or any other combination that does not allow the described operations to make all elements the same).

### Why the Program is Incorrect
The program does not correctly handle the requirement to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the "beautiful" property. It simply finds the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements and assumes that removing elements from this segment will suffice, which is not always true.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve checking the structure of the array and determining the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` for `2 <= i <= n-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect for at least the provided counterexample. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
