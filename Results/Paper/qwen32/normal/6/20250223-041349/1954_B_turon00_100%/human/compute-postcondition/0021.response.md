The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given the initial state, `ans` can either be `n` or `0`, and `cnt` can either be `2` or `0`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:
1. If `cnt` is `2`, `ans` will be updated to `min(ans, 2)`.
   - If `ans` was originally `n`, then `ans` becomes `min(n, 2)`. Since `n` is at least `1`, `ans` becomes `2` if `n` is `2`, or `n` if `n` is greater than `2`.
   - If `ans` was originally `0`, then `ans` becomes `min(0, 2)`, which is `0`.

2. If `cnt` is `0`, `ans` will be updated to `min(ans, 0)`.
   - If `ans` was originally `n`, then `ans` becomes `min(n, 0)`, which is `0`.
   - If `ans` was originally `0`, `ans` remains `0`.

In summary, after executing the code, `ans` will be `0` if `cnt` is `0`, or `min(n, 2)` if `cnt` is `2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `min(n, 2)`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
