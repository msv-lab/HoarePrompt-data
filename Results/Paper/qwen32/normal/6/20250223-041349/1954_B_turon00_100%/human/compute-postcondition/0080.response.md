The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is 2 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0. After the increment, `cnt` will be 3 if it was initially 2, or 1 if it was initially 0. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 3 if `a[i]` was equal to `tmp` initially, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `i` is 2.**

In simpler terms: `cnt` is incremented by 1, making it 3 if it was 2, or 1 if it was 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
