Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is `s + c * (m + k - 1) * m * (c^k - 1) / (c - 1) + k * c * a`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is `m + k`**

The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated to the new integer values provided by user input. All other variables (`M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged as the code snippet only updates the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
