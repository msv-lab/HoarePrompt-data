### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: Number of children.
   - `m`: Number of friend pairs.
   - `k`: Number of excursions.
   - For each friend pair, there are indices `a_i`, `b_i`, and friendship value `f_i`.

2. **Objective**:
   - Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and the result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program provided has several issues:
1. **Initialization of `c`**:
   ```python
   c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
   ```
   This line incorrectly calculates the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` instead of `n * (n - 1) // 2`. The correct initialization should be:
   ```python
   c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
   ```

2. **Calculation of `s`**:
   The loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
   ```
   The formula used here is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions should be calculated based on the probability of selecting each pair and the expected increase in their friendship values.

3. **Handling of friendship values**:
   The program reads the friendship values but does not use them correctly in the calculation of the expected sum. The friendship values `f_i` should be used to calculate the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over `k` excursions.

4. **Modular arithmetic**:
   The program uses modular arithmetic correctly in places, but the overall logic is flawed due to the incorrect calculation of `c` and the incorrect formula for `s`.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem:
- Calculate the probability of selecting each pair of friends, which is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
- For each friend pair with friendship value `f_i`, the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\).
- The expected sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions is the sum of `f_i * \frac{k(k+1)}{2} * \frac{2}{n(n-1)}` for all friend pairs.
- Finally, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        prob = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        expected_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            # Expected increase in friendship value for this pair over k excursions
            expected_increase = (k * (k + 1) // 2) * prob
            expected_sum = (expected_sum + f * expected_increase) % M
        print(expected_sum)

func()
```

#### Evaluation:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected program addresses these issues and provides the correct solution.

### Final: **False**
