The code snippet provided takes input from the user, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. Since the input is guaranteed to be at least 1 for each of the values, `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated to the integer values provided by the user's input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integer values provided by the user's input, which are at least 1; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged.**
