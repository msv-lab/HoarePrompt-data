You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions. Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value, and this value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen.

### Program Analysis

The program iterates over multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k). It then processes m lines of input, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions.

### Issues in the Provided Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Inverse Modulo:**
   - The program calculates the inverse modulo of `n * (n - 1) // 2` as `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This is incorrect because the denominator should be `n * (n - 1) // 2` and not `n * (n - 1) // 1`.
   - The correct line should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates `s` in a loop for `k` iterations with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula is incorrect and does not correctly compute the expected value.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated based on the probability of selecting each pair and the expected increase in friendship values over k excursions.

3. **Simplification and Correct Formula:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for k excursions can be calculated as follows:
     - For each pair of friends, the expected number of times they are chosen is `k / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
     - The expected sum of friendship values for each pair is the initial friendship value plus the expected increase in friendship values.
     - The expected increase in friendship values for a pair chosen `x` times is the sum of the first `x` natural numbers, which is `x * (x + 1) / 2`.
     - The expected value for all pairs is the sum of the expected values for each pair.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the provided program, the program is not correct. The program incorrectly calculates the inverse modulo and the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
