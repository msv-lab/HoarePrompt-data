Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of people, the number of friend pairs, and a threshold value, respectively. For each of the `m` friend pairs, it accepts integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing the two friends and the strength of their friendship. The function returns a value indicating whether the sum of the strengths of the `k` strongest friendships exceeds a certain condition, or handles invalid inputs based on the provided constraints.**
