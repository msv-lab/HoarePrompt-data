The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be `m`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is `m`**
