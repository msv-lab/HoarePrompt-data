The code snippet provided is `a = 0`. This line of code assigns the value `0` to the variable `a`. None of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and the list of friend pairs) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integer values provided by the user's input, which are at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is 0; `a` is 0.**
