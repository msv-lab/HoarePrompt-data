The code snippet `a += f` updates the value of `a` by adding the value of `f` to it. Given the initial state, `a` was initially `f + f`, which simplifies to `2 * f`. After the operation, `a` becomes `2 * f + f`, which simplifies to `3 * f`.

Here are the variables that remain unchanged: `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, the list of friend pairs, `c`, `s`, `u`, `v`, and `f`. The variable `i` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integer values provided by the user's input, which are at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is 0; `a` is `3 * f`; `m` must be greater than 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are the three integers provided by the user's input; `i` is 2.**
