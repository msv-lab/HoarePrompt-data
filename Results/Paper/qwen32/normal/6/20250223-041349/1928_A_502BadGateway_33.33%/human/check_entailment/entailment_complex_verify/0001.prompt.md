You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
    #The program returns 'yes' if b is even, otherwise it returns 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. It returns 'yes' if `b` is even, otherwise it returns 'no'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given problem states that Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles, and then try to form a different rectangle from the two resulting rectangles. The key point here is to determine if it's possible to form a different rectangle by rearranging the two smaller rectangles.

Let's analyze the conditions under which Bob can form a different rectangle:

1. If Bob cuts the rectangle \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles, he can either cut it vertically or horizontally.
2. If he cuts it vertically, the resulting rectangles will have dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) and \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) if \(b\) is even.
3. If he cuts it horizontally, the resulting rectangles will have dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) and \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) if \(a\) is even.
4. From these two smaller rectangles, Bob can form a new rectangle with dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\) or \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\), which are different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle if the cut is possible.

From the above analysis, it is clear that Bob can form a different rectangle if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. However, the provided code only checks if \(b\) is even and does not consider the case when \(a\) is even. Therefore, the code is incorrect for cases where \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd.

For example, if the input is \(2 \times 1\), the code will output "No", but the correct output should be "Yes" because Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles and form a \(2 \times 1\) rectangle, which is considered the same as the original but the code should recognize that the condition of forming a different rectangle is met by considering the rearrangement of the smaller rectangles.

Thus, the code provided is not fully correct based on the problem description.
