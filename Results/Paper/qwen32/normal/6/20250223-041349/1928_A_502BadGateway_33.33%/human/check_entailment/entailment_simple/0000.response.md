Reasoning:
To determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting the original rectangle of size \( a \times b \), we need to analyze the conditions under which this is possible.

The key insight is that Bob can only form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a rectangle with different dimensions. This can be achieved if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle is even because:
- If \( b \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \). These two rectangles can then be combined to form a new rectangle of size \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \) (or \( a \times 2 \times \frac{b}{2} \)), which is different from the original rectangle unless \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 2 \), but in that case, the resulting rectangles are the same as the original when rotated.
- Similarly, if \( a \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) and rearrange them to form a new rectangle of size \( \frac{a}{2} \times 2b \).

However, if both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, the smallest resulting rectangles after a cut will have one dimension as 1, and rearranging them will not yield a rectangle with different dimensions from the original.

The function `func_1(a, b)` in the provided program checks if \( b \) is even. If \( b \) is even, it returns 'yes', indicating that it is possible to form another rectangle. If \( b \) is odd, it returns 'no'. However, this logic is incomplete because it does not consider the case where \( a \) is even.

To be correct, the function should check if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even. The correct logic should be:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

Given the current implementation, the function will incorrectly return 'no' for cases where \( a \) is even and \( b \) is odd, which should actually return 'yes'.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
