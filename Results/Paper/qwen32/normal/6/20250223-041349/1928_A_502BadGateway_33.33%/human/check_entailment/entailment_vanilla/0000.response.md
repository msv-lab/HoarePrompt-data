Reasoning:

The given problem states that Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles, and then try to form a different rectangle from the two resulting rectangles. The key point here is to determine if it's possible to form a different rectangle by rearranging the two smaller rectangles.

Let's analyze the conditions under which Bob can form a different rectangle:

1. If Bob cuts the rectangle \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles, he can either cut it vertically or horizontally.
2. If he cuts it vertically, the resulting rectangles will have dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) and \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) if \(b\) is even.
3. If he cuts it horizontally, the resulting rectangles will have dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) and \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) if \(a\) is even.
4. From these two smaller rectangles, Bob can form a new rectangle with dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\) or \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\), which are different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle if the cut is possible.

From the above analysis, it is clear that Bob can form a different rectangle if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. However, the provided code only checks if \(b\) is even and does not consider the case when \(a\) is even. Therefore, the code is incorrect for cases where \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd.

For example, if the input is \(2 \times 1\), the code will output "No", but the correct output should be "Yes" because Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles and form a \(2 \times 1\) rectangle, which is considered the same as the original but the code should recognize that the condition of forming a different rectangle is met by considering the rearrangement of the smaller rectangles.

Thus, the code provided is not fully correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
