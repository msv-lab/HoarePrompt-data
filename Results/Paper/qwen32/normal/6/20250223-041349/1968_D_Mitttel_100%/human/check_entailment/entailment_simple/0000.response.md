### Reasoning:

The provided program appears to be correctly structured to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based, which is a common practice in Python to simplify array indexing.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for both Bodya and Sasha to calculate their maximum possible scores.
   - The function `func_1` takes the array `a`, the permutation `p`, the starting position `s`, and the number of turns `k`.
   - It initializes variables to keep track of the maximum score (`mx`), the current score (`cur`), and a visited list (`vis`).
   - It iterates through the positions according to the permutation, updating the score and checking if the current position has been visited.
   - The loop continues until a cycle is detected (a visited position is found) or `k` turns have elapsed.
   - During each iteration, the function updates the maximum score (`mx`) considering the remaining turns `k`.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the scores for Bodya and Sasha, the program compares the scores.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input parsing, the score calculation, and the comparison of scores accurately. The use of a visited list ensures that the program does not get stuck in infinite loops due to cycles in the permutation.

Given the problem constraints, the program is efficient enough to handle the maximum input size within the given limits. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
