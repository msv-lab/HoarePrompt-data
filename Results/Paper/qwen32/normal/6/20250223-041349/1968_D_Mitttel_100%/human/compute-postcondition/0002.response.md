The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `cur` to 0. None of the other variables (`a`, `p`, `s`, `mx`) are affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation of length n where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, `s` is a tuple containing four integers (t, n, P_B, P_S) where t is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is the length of the permutation (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), P_B and P_S are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n), and k is the duration of the game (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9); `mx` is 0; `cur` is 0.**
