a and p are lists of integers of length n, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), s is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n), and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). Each element in p is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), and each element in a is a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
