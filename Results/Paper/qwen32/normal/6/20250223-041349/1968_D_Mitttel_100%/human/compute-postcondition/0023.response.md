To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop continues as long as `vis[s]` is `False` and `k` is greater than 0. During each iteration:
1. `vis[s]` is set to `1` to mark the current position `s` as visited.
2. `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
3. `cur` is incremented by `a[s]`.
4. `k` is decremented by 1.
5. `s` is updated to `p[s]`, moving to the next position in the permutation.

Given the initial state and the first three output states, we infer that the loop will continue until either:
- `s` revisits a position that has already been visited (`vis[s]` becomes `True`), indicating a cycle.
- `k` reaches `0`, indicating the game duration has ended.

Let's assume the loop terminates due to one of these conditions. The final state will be:

- `vis`: A list where `vis[i]` is `1` for all positions `i` that were visited during the loop, and `0` otherwise.
- `mx`: The maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during any iteration of the loop.
- `cur`: The cumulative sum of `a[s]` for all positions `s` visited during the loop.
- `k`: The remaining duration of the game, which could be `0` if the loop terminated due to `k` reaching `0`, or a positive integer if the loop terminated due to revisiting a position.
- `s`: The last position visited in the loop before termination.

Based on the given information, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **vis is a list where vis[i] is 1 for all visited positions i, mx is the maximum value of cur + k * a[s] encountered, cur is the cumulative sum of a[s] for all visited positions, k is the remaining duration of the game, and s is the last visited position before termination.**

In simpler terms:
- `vis` will have `1`s at the indices of all positions visited during the loop.
- `mx` will hold the highest value of `cur + k * a[s]` that was calculated.
- `cur` will be the total sum of the values of `a[s]` for all positions visited.
- `k` will be the remaining time after the loop ends, which could be `0` if the game duration was exhausted, or a positive number if the loop terminated due to a cycle.
- `s` will be the last position visited before the loop terminated.
