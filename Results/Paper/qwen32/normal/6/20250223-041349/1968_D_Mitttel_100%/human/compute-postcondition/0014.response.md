The code snippet provided is `k -= 1`, which means the variable `k` is decremented by 1. No other variables in the initial state are affected by this operation.

Initial State: `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is `p[P_S]` and `s` is not equal to `P_B`, `k` is at least 1, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `cur` is `2 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and the integer at index `s` is 1 and all other integers are 0.

After executing `k -= 1`, the value of `k` is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is `p[P_S]` and `s` is not equal to `P_B`, `k` is at least 0, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `cur` is `2 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and the integer at index `s` is 1 and all other integers are 0.**
