The code snippet reads a new line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `nums`. This means that `nums` will now hold the new list of integers provided in the input, sorted in descending order as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 499; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order as provided in the new input.**
