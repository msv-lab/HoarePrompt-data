The code snippet `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `t` and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 499; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
