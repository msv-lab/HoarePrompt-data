Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly identifies the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and selecting the book with the highest number of pages from each pile. 

The logic is straightforward:
1. For each test case, read the number of books `n` and the list of pages in each book.
2. Sort the list of pages in descending order.
3. Sum the pages of the two books with the highest number of pages (i.e., `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`), which are the books Alice will read from each pile.
4. Output this sum for each test case.

This approach ensures that Alice reads the maximum number of pages possible by always choosing the two books with the most pages.
