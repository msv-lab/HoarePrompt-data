The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` by reading a new input and converting it to an integer. The values of `t` and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 499; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order as provided in the new input.**
