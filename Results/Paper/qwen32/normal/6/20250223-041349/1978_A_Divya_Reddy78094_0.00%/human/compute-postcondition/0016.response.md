Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 500; all test cases have been processed.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will have been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The state of `n` and `nums` will reflect the last processed test case, but since the loop has finished, they do not hold any specific significance beyond the last iteration.
