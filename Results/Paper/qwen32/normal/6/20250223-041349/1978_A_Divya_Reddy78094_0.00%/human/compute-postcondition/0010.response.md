Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order as provided in the new input.

The print statement:
```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

### Analysis:
- `nums` is a list of integers that is sorted in descending order.
- `nums[0]` will be the largest element in the list because it is the first element in a descending order list.
- `nums[1]` will be the second largest element in the list because it is the second element in a descending order list.
- The print statement calculates the sum of the largest and second largest elements in the `nums` list and prints this sum.

### Output:
The output will be the sum of the largest and second largest integers in the `nums` list.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest element and nums[1] is the second largest element in the sorted list `nums`)**
