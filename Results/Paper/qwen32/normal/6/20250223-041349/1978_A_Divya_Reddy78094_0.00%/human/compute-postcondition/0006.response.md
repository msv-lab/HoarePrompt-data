The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` represents the number of test cases left to process, and since the loop uses `_` as a throwaway variable, we don't need to adjust its state explicitly.

At the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 because one test case has been processed.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
