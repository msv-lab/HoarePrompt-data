### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary in detail to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. **String Conversion**: Convert the string `s` of length `n` into an array `a` where each '+' is `1` and each '-' is `-1`.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: Split `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty `p(b_1) + p(b_2) + ... + p(b_k)` is minimized. The penalty for a subarray `b` is `|sum(b)| * len(b)`.
3. **Objective**: Find the minimum possible penalty.

#### Provided Program Recap:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` processes each test case by counting the number of '-' characters (`neg`).
- It prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n != neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Counting '-' Characters**: The program correctly counts the number of '-' characters in the string.
2. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - **Case 1**: When `n != neg` (i.e., there are both '+' and '-' characters).
     - The formula `n - 2 * neg` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty. This formula does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays with minimal penalties.
   - **Case 2**: When `n == neg` (i.e., the string consists only of '-' characters).
     - The formula `n` is correct because the only way to split the array is into individual `-1` elements, each contributing `1` to the total penalty.

#### Correctness Check:
- **Case 1**: When `n != neg`
  - This formula does not consider the optimal splitting strategy. For example, in the string `"+-+-+"`, the optimal split is `["+","-","+", "-","+" ]` which results in a penalty of `0` for each subarray, totaling `0`. The formula `n - 2 * neg` would yield `5 - 2 * 2 = 1`, which is incorrect.
- **Case 2**: When `n == neg`
  - The formula `n` is correct because the optimal split is into individual `-1` elements, each contributing `1` to the total penalty.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty for all cases. Specifically, the formula `n - 2 * neg` is not a valid way to compute the minimum penalty for strings containing both '+' and '-' characters. The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
