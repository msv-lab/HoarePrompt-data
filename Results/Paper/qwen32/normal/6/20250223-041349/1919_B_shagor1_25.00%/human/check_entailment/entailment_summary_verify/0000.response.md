### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The program seems to be trying to count the number of '+' and '-' characters and then calculating a penalty based on that, but it does not implement the logic for optimally splitting the array to minimize the penalty.

Let's break down the problem and the code:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to split the array into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The optimal solution requires a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy strategy, to find the best way to split the array.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of '-' characters in the string.
   - It then prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`, but it does not imply that this behavior is correct for solving the problem.

4. **Example of Incorrectness**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     ++--+
     ```
   - The correct output should be `4` because the optimal split is `([1,1,-1,-1],[1])` which gives a penalty of `|1+1-1-1|*4 + |1|*1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - However, the provided code will output `5 - 2 * 2 = 1` (since there are 3 '+' and 2 '-'), which is incorrect for this case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not implement the correct logic to find the minimum penalty for splitting the array. It simplifies the problem in a way that does not guarantee the optimal solution. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final: **False**
