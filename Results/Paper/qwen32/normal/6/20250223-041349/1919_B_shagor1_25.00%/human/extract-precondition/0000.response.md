Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string s. The following line contains the string s of length n, consisting only of the characters "+" and "-". The number of test cases t is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. There are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.**
