Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`. The following line contains the string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters "+" and "-". The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. There are no constraints on the sum of `n` over all test cases. `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the length of the string `s` for the current test case. The other conditions and constraints on the input remain unchanged.
