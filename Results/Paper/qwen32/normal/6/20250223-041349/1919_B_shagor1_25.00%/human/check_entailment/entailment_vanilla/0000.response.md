Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to split a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is calculated as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

### Key Points:
1. **Conversion of String to Array**: Each '+' in the string `s` represents `1` and each '-' represents `-1`.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: For a subarray `b`, the penalty `p(b)` is `|sum(b)| * len(b)`.
3. **Objective**: Minimize the total penalty after splitting the array optimally.

### Observations:
- To minimize the penalty, we should aim to create subarrays where the sum of elements is `0` because the penalty for such subarrays is `0`.
- If it's not possible to create subarrays with a sum of `0`, then we should create subarrays with the smallest possible absolute sum.

### Provided Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Counting '-' Characters**: The program counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
2. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - If the number of '-' characters (`neg`) is not equal to the length of the string `n` (i.e., `n != neg`), the program calculates the penalty as `n - 2 * neg`.
   - If the number of '-' characters is equal to the length of the string (i.e., `n == neg`), the program calculates the penalty as `n`.

#### Correctness Check:
- **Case 1**: When `n != neg`
  - This means there are both '+' and '-' characters in the string.
  - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is not necessarily correct for minimizing the penalty. It does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays with minimal penalties.
- **Case 2**: When `n == neg`
  - This means the string consists only of '-' characters.
  - The formula `n` is correct because the only way to split the array is into individual `-1` elements, each contributing `1` to the total penalty.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty for all cases. Specifically, the formula `n - 2 * neg` is not a valid way to compute the minimum penalty for strings containing both '+' and '-' characters.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
