The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. Since the loop body is omitted, we can only adjust the state of `i` and ensure that there are more characters left in `s` for the loop to continue executing.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next character in the string. Since `i` is currently the last character processed, the next character in the string `s` would be the character after `i`.

However, we do not have information about the exact position of `i` in the string `s`, but we know that `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "+" and "-". Therefore, for the loop to continue, there must be at least one more character in `s` after the current `i`.

Since we don't have the exact position of `i` in `s`, we can denote the next character in `s` as `i_next`. Given that `i` is the current character, `i_next` would be the subsequent character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", `i` is the next character in the string `s` (i.e., `i_next`)**

However, to be more precise and align with the format of the previous examples, we can assume that `i` has just finished processing the current character and is now pointing to the next character in the string. Therefore, we can denote the new state of `i` as the next character in the sequence.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", `i` is the next character in the string `s` (i.e., the character after the previously processed character)**

Since we need to specify the exact state and we don't have the exact position, we can infer that `i` is now the next character in the sequence, and `n` must be at least 2 to have a next character.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", `i` is the next character in the string `s`**
