Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of a string `s`, followed by the string `s` of length `n` that contains only the characters "+" and "-". The function processes each test case and returns the result for each one. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. There are no constraints on the sum of `n` over all test cases.**
