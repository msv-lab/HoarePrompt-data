You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the way it handles the sliding window technique and the comparison of counts between the subarray of `a` and the array `b`. Specifically, the logic for adjusting the `sm` variable (which tracks the number of common elements between the current window of `a` and `b`) is flawed.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initialization and First Window**:
   - The initial count of common elements between the first window of `a` (of length `m`) and `b` is correctly calculated using `sm = sum((ca & cb).values())`.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program then slides the window one element to the right in each iteration.
   - When a new element enters the window (`a[r]`), it checks if the count of this element in `ca` is less than its count in `cb`. If so, it increments `sm`. This logic is flawed because it should only increment `sm` if the new element's count in `ca` becomes equal to its count in `cb` for the first time.
   - Similarly, when an element exits the window (`a[r - m]`), it checks if its count in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`. If so, it decrements `sm`. This logic is also flawed because it should only decrement `sm` if the element's count in `ca` becomes less than its count in `cb` for the first time.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3 2
1 2 3 2 1
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The subarrays of `a` of length `m` are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 2]`, and `[3, 2, 1]`.
- Only the subarray `[2, 3, 2]` can be rearranged to match at least `k = 2` elements of `b = [2, 2, 2]`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will likely output `3` because it incorrectly increments and decrements `sm` based on the flawed logic described above.

To fix the program, the logic for updating `sm` should be corrected to accurately reflect the number of common elements between the current window of `a` and `b`. This involves checking the exact counts and ensuring that `sm` is updated only when necessary.
