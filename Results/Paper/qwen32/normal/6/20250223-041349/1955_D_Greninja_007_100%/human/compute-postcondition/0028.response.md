The only variable in the loop head is `r`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `r` accordingly. The loop iterates from `m` to `n-1`, so at the start of the next iteration, `r` should be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6
- `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`
- `ca` is a `Counter` object where the count of `a[r - m]` has been decremented by 1
- `sm` is decremented by 1 if `ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]`
- `ans` is incremented by 1 if `sm >= k`
- `r` remains unchanged

To start the next iteration, we increment `r` by 1.
