Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k` which are integers, and two lists `a` and `b` where `a` contains `n` integers and `b` contains `m` integers. The function returns `ans`, which is the count of times the sum `sm` of elements from `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.**
