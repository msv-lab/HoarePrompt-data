You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if (sm >= k) :
        ans += 1
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`; `sm` is the sum of the minimum of the counts of each element in `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the last `m` elements of `a`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum of the counts of each element in `ca` and `cb`, and `ans` is incremented each time `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans` which is incremented each time `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k` which are integers, and two lists `a` and `b` where `a` contains `n` integers and `b` contains `m` integers. The function returns `ans`, which is the count of times the sum `sm` of elements from `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `ans` which is incremented each time `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
