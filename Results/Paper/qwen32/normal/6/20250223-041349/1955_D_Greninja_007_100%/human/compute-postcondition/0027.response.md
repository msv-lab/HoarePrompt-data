Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a `Counter` object where the count of `a[r - m]` has been decremented by 1, `sm` is decremented by 1 if `ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `sm >= k`, and `r` remains unchanged.**
