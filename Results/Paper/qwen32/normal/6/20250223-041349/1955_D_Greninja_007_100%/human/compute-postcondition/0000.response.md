The code snippet sorts the list `b` and then creates a `Counter` object from the sorted list, which counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged. The new variable `cb` is introduced to hold the `Counter` object.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`.**
