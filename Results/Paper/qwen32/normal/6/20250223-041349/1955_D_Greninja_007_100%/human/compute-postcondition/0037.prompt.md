Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`; `sm` is the sum of the minimum of the counts of each element in `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
        sm += 1
    ca[a[r]] += 1
    if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
        sm -= 1
    ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]` with the count of `a[r]` incremented by 1 and the count of `a[r - m]` decremented by 1. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, then `sm` is the sum of the minimum of the counts of each element in `ca` and `cb` plus 1, and `sm` has been decremented by 1. Otherwise, `sm` remains the sum of the minimum of the counts of each element in `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a `Counter` object where the count of `a[r - m]` has been decremented by 1, `sm` is decremented by 1 if `ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `sm >= k`, and `r` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a `Counter` object where the count of `a[r - m]` has been decremented by 1, and the count of `a[r]` has been incremented by 1, `sm` is unchanged, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `r` is unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
