Output State: **`r` is the index of the first element from the end that is different from its successor, or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal; `end` is the number of times the loop decremented `r`; `st` is 0; `end` is 0; `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]; `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**

In natural language: The variable `ans` is now assigned the value of `len(a) - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
