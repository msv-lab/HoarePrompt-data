To determine the final output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop condition is `while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `r` is greater than `l` and the element at index `r` is equal to the element at index `r - 1`. In each iteration, `r` is decremented by 1, and `end` is incremented by 1.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop is reducing `r` by 1 each time `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true. The loop will stop when `r` is no longer greater than `l` or when `a[r] != a[r - 1]`.

Let's denote the initial value of `r` as `n - 1`. The loop will decrement `r` until `r` is either equal to `l` or `a[r] != a[r - 1]`. Since `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `n - 1` if all elements are the same, the loop will stop when `r` reaches `l`.

At this point, `end` will be the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list up to the point where the sequence of equal elements stops.

The final value of `ans` will be calculated based on the conditions:
- If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a` and all elements are the same, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
- Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.

Since the loop stops when `r` reaches `l` or `a[r] != a[r - 1]`, the final value of `r` will be `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are the same, or the index where the sequence of equal elements stops.

Therefore, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `n - 1` if all elements are the same, `r` is `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are the same, otherwise the index where the sequence of equal elements stops, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list up to the point where the sequence of equal elements stops, `ans` is `r - l - 1` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a` and all elements are the same, otherwise if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is `r - l`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will stop when it finds the first element from the end that is not equal to the previous one, and `ans` will be calculated based on the conditions provided.
