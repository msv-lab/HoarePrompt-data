Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input such that `a[0] == a[1]`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `st` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
