Output State: **`r` is the index of the first element from the end that is different from its successor, or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal; `end` is the number of times the loop decremented `r`; `ans` is `r - l - 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is calculated as `r - l - 1`. The values of `r` and `end` remain unchanged, and `end` still represents the number of times the loop decremented `r`. The condition for `r` remains the same, being the index of the first element from the end that is different from its successor, or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal.
