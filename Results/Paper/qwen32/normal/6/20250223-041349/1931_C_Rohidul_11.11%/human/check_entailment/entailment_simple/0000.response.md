### Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by identifying the longest contiguous segments of equal elements from the start and end of the array. However, the logic used to calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal is flawed.

Here are some issues with the provided code:
1. **Logic for Cost Calculation:**
   - The code calculates the cost based on the longest contiguous segments from the start and end of the array. However, it does not consider the possibility of choosing a different segment that might result in a lower cost.
   - For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], the code calculates the cost based on the segments [1] from the start and [1] from the end, leading to an incorrect cost of 4. However, the optimal operation would be to choose the segment [2, 3, 4, 5] and set it to 1, resulting in a cost of 4, which is correct, but the code does not generalize this approach.
   
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where the array has more than two distinct elements in a non-contiguous pattern effectively. For example, in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], the optimal solution is to change the middle segment, but the code does not account for this.

3. **Simplification:**
   - The problem can be simplified by observing that the optimal strategy involves changing the segment that, when changed, minimizes the number of elements that need to be changed. This might involve changing the entire array if no contiguous segments can be reused efficiently.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**

The code needs to be revised to correctly handle all edge cases and efficiently compute the minimum cost. One possible approach is to use a different strategy, such as finding the most frequent element in the array and calculating the cost to change all elements to that element, or using dynamic programming to explore different segments.
