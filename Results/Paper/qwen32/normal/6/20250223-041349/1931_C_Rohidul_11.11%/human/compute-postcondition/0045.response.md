Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 2, `end` is 0, `ans` is `r - l - 1` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is `r - l`.**

In simple terms, the value of `st` has been incremented by 1, making `st` equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
