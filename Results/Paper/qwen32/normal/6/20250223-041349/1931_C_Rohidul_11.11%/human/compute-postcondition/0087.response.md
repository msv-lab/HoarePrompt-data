Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input such that the last two elements are equal, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the index of the first element that is different from its predecessor and is not equal to `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is the number of times the loop has incremented `l`, `end` is 1.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `end` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
