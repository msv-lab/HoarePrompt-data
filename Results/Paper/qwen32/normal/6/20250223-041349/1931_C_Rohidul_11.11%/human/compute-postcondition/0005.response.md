To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of the variables involved in the loop condition: `l`, `r`, and `a[l]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `l < r`**:
   - This condition ensures that the left index `l` is less than the right index `r`.
   - Given the initial state, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, making `r` at least 1. This ensures `l < r`.

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`**:
   - This condition ensures that the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`.
   - Initially, `l` is 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a[0] == a[1]`.

### Adjustments:
- **`n`**: Must be at least 2 to ensure `r` is at least 1.
- **`a`**: The first two elements must be equal, i.e., `a[0] == a[1]`.

### Conclusion:
To make sure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 and the first two elements of the list `a` are equal. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input such that `a[0] == a[1]`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 0; `end` is 0**
