The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is initially set to `l + 1`. After the operation, `r` will be equal to `l`. 

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `st`, and `end`) remain unchanged. The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is not affected by this operation because `r` is simply moved back by one position, and the condition is based on the values at these positions, which do not change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `end` is 1; `a[r] == a[r - 1]`**
