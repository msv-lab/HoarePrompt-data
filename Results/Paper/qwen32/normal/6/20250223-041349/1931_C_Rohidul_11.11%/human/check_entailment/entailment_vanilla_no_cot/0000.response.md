Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation. The logic in the program does not consider all possible scenarios and does not correctly handle the cases where the optimal solution involves changing the middle part of the array or when the array has repeating elements in a non-trivial pattern.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The program would output `2`, but the correct answer is `1` because we can change the entire array to `1` or `2` or `3` in one operation, which costs `1` burle.

Another example:
```
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
The program would output `3`, but the correct answer is `2` because we can change the array to `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` or `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` or `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` in one operation, which costs `2` burles.

The program needs a more comprehensive approach to find the minimum cost, possibly involving dynamic programming or a sliding window technique to evaluate the cost of changing different segments of the array.
