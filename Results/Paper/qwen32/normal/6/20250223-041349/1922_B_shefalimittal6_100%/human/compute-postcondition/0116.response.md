The code snippet provided is `ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. This line modifies the value of `ans` by adding the product of `cnt`, `v[i]`, and `(v[i] - 1) // 2` to it.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n.
- `input` is a string containing all the input data.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace.
- `idx` is `12 + n`.
- `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`.
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers.
- `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`.
- `ans` is incremented by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 0.

The execution of the code snippet will change the value of `ans` as follows:
- `ans` is incremented by `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2`.

Since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, we will denote the new value of `ans` as `ans + cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `12 + n`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `ans` is `ans + cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2`, `i` is 0.**
