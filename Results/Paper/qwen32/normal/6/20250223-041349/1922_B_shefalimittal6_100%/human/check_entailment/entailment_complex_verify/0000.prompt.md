You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The current implementation does not check the triangle inequality condition, which is crucial for determining if three sticks can form a triangle. Specifically, for three sticks with lengths \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) (where \(x \leq y \leq z\)), they can form a non-degenerate triangle if and only if \(x + y > z\).

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
0 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The stick lengths are \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^2 = 4\).
- The only combination of three sticks is (1, 2, 4).
- However, \(1 + 2 \not> 4\), so they cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.
- Therefore, the correct output is 0, not 1.

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
The program will likely output 1 for this input, as it does not check the triangle inequality condition.

To fix the program, we need to iterate through all combinations of three sticks and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality condition. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    import itertools

    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        lengths = [2 ** int(data[idx + i]) for i in range(n)]
        idx += n
        lengths.sort()
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
                k = j + 1
                while k < n and lengths[i] + lengths[j] > lengths[k]:
                    k += 1
                ans += k - j - 1
        results.append(str(ans))
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

This corrected program sorts the stick lengths and uses a nested loop to check all combinations of three sticks, ensuring they satisfy the triangle inequality condition.
