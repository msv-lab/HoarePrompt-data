Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is 4, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 3, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element is incremented based on the values of `x` read from `data`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[3]`, `i` is 0. If `v[i]` (which is `v[0]` in this context) is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated by adding `v[0] * (v[0] - 1) * (v[0] - 2) // 6` to its previous value. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
