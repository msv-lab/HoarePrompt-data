The provided code snippet modifies the value of `ans` by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to it. No other variables are explicitly modified in the code snippet. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `12 + n`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `i` is 0. `ans` is incremented by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**
