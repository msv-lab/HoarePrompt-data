The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`. Since the loop iterates `_` from `0` to `n-1`, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than `0`. The state of `t`, `a_i`, `input`, `data`, `idx`, `results`, and `v` do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `0`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0**
