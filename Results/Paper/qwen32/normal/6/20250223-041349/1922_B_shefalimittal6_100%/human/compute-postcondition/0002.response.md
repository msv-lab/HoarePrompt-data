The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `idx` to 0. No other variables are modified or assigned new values. The values of `t`, `n`, the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, and `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 <= a_i <= n; `input` is a string containing all the input data; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace; `idx` is 0.**
