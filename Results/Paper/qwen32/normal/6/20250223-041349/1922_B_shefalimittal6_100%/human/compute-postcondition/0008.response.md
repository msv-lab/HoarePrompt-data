The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` was 1, so now `idx` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list.
