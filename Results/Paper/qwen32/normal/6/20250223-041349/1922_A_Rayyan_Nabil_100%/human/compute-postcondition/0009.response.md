The code snippet provided updates the value of `n` by reading a new integer input from the user. Therefore, the value of `n` will change to whatever positive integer input is provided, while the other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20 (as per the new input), `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 0, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
