Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20.
2. `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
3. `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
4. `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
5. `t` is an integer such that `t` > 0.
6. `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet attempts to print a variable named `result`.
- However, in the provided initial state, there is no variable named `result`. There is a variable named `results`, which is a list.
- Since `result` is not defined in the initial state, it seems there is a typo in the print statement. It should likely be `results` instead of `result`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `result` is not defined, so the code will raise a `NameError`. However, based on the context, it seems the intention was to print the `results` list.

If we assume the correct variable name is `results`, then the output would be the list `results`, which contains `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and the function `func_1` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact values in the `results` list. However, we can describe what the output will look like.

### Final Output:
Output: **results (where results is a list containing t elements, each being the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) for each iteration)**

If the intention was indeed to print `results`, this is the most precise description we can provide given the information.
