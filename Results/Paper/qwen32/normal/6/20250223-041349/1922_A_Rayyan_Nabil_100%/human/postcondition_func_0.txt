The function `func_1` accepts three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. It checks each corresponding character in the strings `a` and `b` against the character in `c`. If there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` have characters different from the character in `c`, the function returns 'YES'. If no such position exists after checking all characters, it returns 'NO'.
