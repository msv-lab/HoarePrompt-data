The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If `results` has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing `t` elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least `t + 1` elements. However, since the loop iterates over `results` and we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we can infer that `result` will take the next value in the `results` list.

Therefore, we need to adjust `result` to be the next element in the `results` list. Since we don't have specific values for the elements in `results`, we can only state that `result` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `a` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `t` is an integer such that `t` > 0; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration; `result` is the next element in the `results` list.**
