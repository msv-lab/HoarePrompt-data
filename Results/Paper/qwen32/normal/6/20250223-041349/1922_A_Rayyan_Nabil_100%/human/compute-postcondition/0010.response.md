The code snippet assigns the value of a newly input string to the variable `a`. The input string consists of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The values of `n`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 0, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
