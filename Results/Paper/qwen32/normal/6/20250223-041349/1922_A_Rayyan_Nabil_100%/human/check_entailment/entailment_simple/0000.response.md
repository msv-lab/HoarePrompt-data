### Reasoning:
The task is to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not. The program checks each position in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` and returns "YES" if there is at least one position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If no such position exists, it returns "NO".

The given program logic in `func_1` checks each character position from 0 to `n-1` in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. If it finds a position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are not equal to `c[i]`, it immediately returns "YES". If the loop completes without finding such a position, it returns "NO". This logic correctly implements the problem's requirements.

The `func_2` function handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, then calls `func_1` to determine the result for each test case. It collects the results and prints them afterward.

### Correctness:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not. It checks each character position independently and returns the correct result based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

**Correctness: True**
