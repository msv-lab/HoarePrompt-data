Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `a` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 0; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values from the last iteration. The variable `t` will remain the same as the input integer, and `results` will be a list containing the return values from `func_1` for each of the `t` iterations.
