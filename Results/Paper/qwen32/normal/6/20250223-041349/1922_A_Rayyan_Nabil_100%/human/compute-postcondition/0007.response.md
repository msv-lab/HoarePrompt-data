To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code snippet on the variables. The code snippet appends the result of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the list `results`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact value that will be appended to `results`. However, we can describe the state after the function call and the result being appended.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20
- `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters
- `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters
- `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters
- `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1
- `results` is an empty list

After executing `results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))`, the list `results` will contain one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
