To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet. 

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `n` is an integer provided by user input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state does not mention any variable named `i`.
- There is no assignment or definition of `i` in the provided code snippet.
- Therefore, the variable `i` is not explicitly defined or initialized in the given context.

### Conclusion:
Since there is no information provided about the variable `i` in the initial state or the code snippet, we cannot determine its value. The variable `i` is undefined in the given context, and attempting to print it would result in a `NameError`.

### Output:
Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
