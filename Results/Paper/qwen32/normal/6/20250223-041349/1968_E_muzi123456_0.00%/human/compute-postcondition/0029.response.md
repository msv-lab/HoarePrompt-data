The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n` and `i` are not part of the loop condition.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n + 1`**
