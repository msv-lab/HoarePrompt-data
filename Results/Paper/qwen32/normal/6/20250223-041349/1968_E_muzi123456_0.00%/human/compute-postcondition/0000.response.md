The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. After executing this line, the value of `t` will be whatever integer the user inputs, but it will still satisfy the condition that it is between 1 and 50. The information about `n` for each test case remains unchanged as it has not been affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.**
