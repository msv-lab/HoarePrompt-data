Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program is not correctly implementing the logic to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The program simply prints points along the first row of the grid, which does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between the points.

For example, consider the case when \(n = 3\):
- The program will output:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  1 3
  ```
- The set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances will be:
  \[
  \mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}
  \]
- However, the optimal arrangement (as shown in the problem description) is:
  ```
  2 1
  2 3
  3 1
  ```
- The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for this arrangement will be:
  \[
  \mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
  \]
- This arrangement results in a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Hence, the program is incorrect because it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases.
