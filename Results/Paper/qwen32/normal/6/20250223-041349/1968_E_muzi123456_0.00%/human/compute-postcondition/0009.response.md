Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 49\)
- `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `i` is assigned the value of `n`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `t` is defined but it is not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, its value does not affect the output.
- The variable `n` is an integer input by the user, and it is constrained to be between 2 and 1000 inclusive.
- The variable `i` is assigned the value of `n`.

### What Will Be Printed:
- Since `i` is assigned the value of `n`, the `print(i)` statement will output the value of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n (where n is the integer value provided by the user input, with 2 <= n <= 1000)**
