Let's analyze the given code and initial state step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` and the `end` parameter set to a space `' '`.
- The `end=' '` parameter specifies that after printing `'1'`, the cursor will move to the next space instead of moving to the next line.

### Variables and Objects:
- The variable `t` is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet.
- The variable `n` is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet.
- The variable `i` is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet.

Since none of the variables `t`, `n`, or `i` are used in the `print` statement, the output will simply be the string `'1'` followed by a space.

### Output:
Output: **1 **
