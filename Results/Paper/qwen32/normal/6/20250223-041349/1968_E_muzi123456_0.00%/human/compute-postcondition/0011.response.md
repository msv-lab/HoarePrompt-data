The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('1', end=' ')`. This statement will print the string `'1'` followed by a space, without a newline at the end because of the `end=' '` argument.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Let's break down the print statement:
- `'1'` is a string literal that will be printed.
- `end=' '` specifies that a space should be printed at the end of the string `'1'` instead of the default newline character.

Given this information, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **1 ** (where the last space represents the space added by `end=' '`)
