### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer \( n \) where \( 2 \leq n \leq 1000 \). For each test case, it outputs \( n \) points in a grid such that the points are all in the first row with varying column indices from 1 to \( n \). This means that for a given \( n \), the points outputted will be \((1,1), (1,2), \ldots, (1,n)\).

Let's analyze the Manhattan distances between these points:
- The Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) (where \( i \neq j \)) is \( |1-1| + |i-j| = |i-j| \).
- Since \( i \) and \( j \) range from 1 to \( n \) and \( i \neq j \), \( |i-j| \) can take any integer value from 1 to \( n-1 \).

Thus, the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\), which has a size of \( n-1 \).

However, the problem statement asks to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For \( n \) points, the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) can be \( 2n-3 \) (achieved by placing points in a zigzag pattern or other optimal configurations). The provided solution does not achieve this maximum for \( n > 2 \).

For example:
- For \( n = 3 \), the optimal solution should have \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) (size 4), but the provided solution gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2\}\) (size 2).
- For \( n = 4 \), the optimal solution should have \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\) (size 6), but the provided solution gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3\}\) (size 3).

Therefore, the provided program does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \( n \).

### Correctness: **False**
