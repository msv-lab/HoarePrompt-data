Reasoning: The provided Python program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then prints `n` points where the x-coordinate is always 1 and the y-coordinate ranges from 1 to `n`. This means that the points printed for each test case are (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,n).

The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. However, the provided program does not achieve this goal because all points lie on the same row (x-coordinate is always 1), which means the Manhattan distance between any two points will only depend on the difference in their y-coordinates. Thus, the possible Manhattan distances in this case will be limited to the set \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\), which has a size of `n`.

To maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be placed in such a way that they cover a larger range of Manhattan distances. For example, placing points at (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3) for n=3 would result in a larger set of Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

Given the provided program's approach, it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
