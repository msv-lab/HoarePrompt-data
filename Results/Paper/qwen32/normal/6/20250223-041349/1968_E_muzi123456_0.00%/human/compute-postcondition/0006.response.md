The given initial state describes the following:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 49\).
- `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).

However, there is a variable `i` in the `print(i)` statement that is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not initialized or given any value in the provided context, its value cannot be determined from the given information.

Given this, the code will raise a `NameError` because `i` is referenced before it is defined. Therefore, the output will indicate this error.

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
