The code snippet assigns the input value to the variable `s`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `a`, and `b` have specific constraints and values, but they are not affected by the code snippet provided. The variable `s` is introduced and is assigned the value of the input, which is a string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and `s` is the input string.**
