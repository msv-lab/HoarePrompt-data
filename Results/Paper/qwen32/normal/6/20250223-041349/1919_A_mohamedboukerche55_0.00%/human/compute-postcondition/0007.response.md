The code snippet `b = int(list(s.split())[1])` splits the string `s` into a list of substrings, and then assigns the second substring (at index 1) to `b` after converting it to an integer.

Given the initial state, `s` is the new input string, and `b` was previously the integer value of the second substring of `s`. After the code executes, `b` will be updated to the integer value of the second substring of the new `s`.

Since `s` is the new input string, we don't have a specific value for it, but we can describe the change in `b` based on the new `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the new input string `s`, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
