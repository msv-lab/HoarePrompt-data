The code snippet takes the input string `s`, splits it into a list of substrings, and then converts the second substring into an integer, which is assigned to `b`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the input string `s`, and `s` is the input string.**
