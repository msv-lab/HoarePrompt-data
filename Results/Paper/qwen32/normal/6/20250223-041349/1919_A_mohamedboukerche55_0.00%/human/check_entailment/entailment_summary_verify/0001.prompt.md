You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints "bob" if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and "alice" if the sum is odd.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the described problem.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks whether the sum of the coins in both wallets `(a + b)` is even or odd.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0` (i.e., the sum is even), it prints "bob".
   - Otherwise, it prints "alice".

3. **Game Analysis:**
   - The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of the number of coins in both wallets).
   - If the Nim-sum of the coins in both wallets is zero, the position is losing for the player who is about to move.
   - If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the position is winning for the player who is about to move.
   - In this problem, since both players play optimally, the game reduces to the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves, ensuring that he will always have a move when Alice does, thus winning the game.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, ensuring that she will always have a move when Bob does, thus winning the game.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins. If the sum is even, Bob wins, and if the sum is odd, Alice wins.

### Program Output:
- The program prints "bob" followed by two spaces if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
- The program prints "alice" if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins in both wallets. However, the output format is not exactly as specified in the problem statement (there should be no extra spaces after "bob").

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** 

This is because the output format should not include extra spaces after "bob". The program should print "bob" without any trailing spaces to match the expected output format.
