Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the new input string `s`, `s` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `s` is reassigned to the new input string provided by the `input()` function. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is incremented by 1.
