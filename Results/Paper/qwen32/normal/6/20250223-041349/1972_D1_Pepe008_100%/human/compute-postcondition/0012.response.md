Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `a + 1`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, the condition is evaluated but no specific changes are mentioned in the if part. If the condition is not met, there is no else part to execute, so the state remains unchanged.**
