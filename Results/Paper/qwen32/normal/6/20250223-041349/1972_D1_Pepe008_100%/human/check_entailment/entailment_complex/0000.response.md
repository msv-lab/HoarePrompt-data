Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The problem asks for the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The given code, however, does not accurately reflect this logic.

The code attempts to calculate some sum based on the values of `a` and `b` but does not properly account for the gcd condition or the multiple relationship between `a + b` and `b * gcd(a, b)`. The formula used in the code `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the conditions that follow do not correspond to the problem's requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges and check if `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`. This would be computationally expensive for large values of `n` and `m`, so optimizations would be necessary, possibly involving mathematical insights or precomputations.

Given the current implementation does not match the problem's requirements, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
