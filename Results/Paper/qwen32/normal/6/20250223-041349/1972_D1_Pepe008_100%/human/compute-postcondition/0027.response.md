The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is some value, and for the loop to execute again, `t` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `T`.

State: **`suma` is the total sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, plus any additional 1s added based on the specified conditions, `t` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be less than `T`**.

To be more specific, if at the end of the previous iteration `t` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration `t` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`suma` is the total sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, plus any additional 1s added based on the specified conditions, `t` is `k + 1`, and `k + 1` must be less than `T`**. 

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`suma` is the total sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, plus any additional 1s added based on the specified conditions, `t` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be less than `T`**.
