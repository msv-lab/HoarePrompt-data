Postcondition: **`suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus `x`, `t` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and it holds that `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0)`**
