You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Annotated Code: 
import  math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    #State: The final value of `suma - 2` after processing all `T` inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on these integers and outputs the result minus 2. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each integer in the range of 1 to 2,000,000, and the cumulative sum of all integers does not exceed 2,000,000.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's first analyze the problem statement and the solution provided in the code.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve this problem using a nested loop approach. However, the logic in the code seems to be incorrect and does not align with the problem requirements. Let's break down the code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and then reads each test case's input values \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Looping Through Values of \(b\):**
   - The code iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).

3. **Calculating the Number of Valid \(a\) for Each \(b\):**
   - The code calculates a value \(x\) based on the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\), where \(i\) is the loop variable representing \(b\).
   - It checks if this value is positive and adds it to the sum.
   - It also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\) to add an additional 1 to the sum.
   - Finally, it prints the sum minus 2.

### Issues with the Code
- The formula used to calculate \(x\) and the logic to determine if an additional 1 should be added do not correctly reflect the problem's conditions.
- The code does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The subtraction of 2 at the end of the sum calculation is not justified by the problem statement or the logic in the code.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This can be done using a nested loop, but the logic for checking the condition must be correct.

### Conclusion
Given the issues with the provided code's logic and formula, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
