Postcondition: **`suma` is 0, `t` is 3, `T` is greater than `t`, `info` is a list of strings based on the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, then `suma` is updated to `suma + x`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is not considered in the postcondition as it is not mentioned in the else part.**
