The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus `x` plus 1, `t` is incremented by 1 and is less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**
