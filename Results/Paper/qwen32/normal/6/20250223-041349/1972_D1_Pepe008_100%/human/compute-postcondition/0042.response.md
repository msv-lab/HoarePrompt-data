Output State: **`suma` is `suma + x + 1`, `t` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**

Natural Language: The value of `suma` is now `suma + x + 1` because 1 has been added to it. The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `T`. The values of `info`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.
