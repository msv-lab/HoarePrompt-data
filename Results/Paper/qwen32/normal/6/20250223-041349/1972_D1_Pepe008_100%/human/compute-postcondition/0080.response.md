Functionality: **The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`. The constraints are that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000, and for each test case, both `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 2,000,000. The sum of all `n` and `m` across all test cases does not exceed 2,000,000.**
