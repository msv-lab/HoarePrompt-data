The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop will execute `t` times, and the loop head does not involve `n`, `k`, or `t` directly in a way that would require adjustment for the loop to continue.

Given that the loop is controlled by `t` iterations, the state of `t` does not change within the loop head. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to reflect that the loop is about to start its next iteration, which does not affect `n` or `k`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t` is a positive integer. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` equals `k`. Otherwise, if `n + 2 > k * 2`, then `n` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
