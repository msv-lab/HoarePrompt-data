Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only checks two conditions:
1. If `n == k`, it outputs "YES" with a single stall priced at 1 coin.
2. If `n + 2 > k * 2`, it outputs "YES" with two stalls, one priced at `n - k + 1` and the other at 1 coin.

However, the problem requires Bob to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program does not provide a general solution for all possible values of `n` and `k` within the given constraints.

For example, consider the test case:
```
1
255 8
```

The correct output should be:
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```

However, the provided program would output "NO" for this case because it does not handle cases where `k` is not equal to `n` and `n + 2` is not greater than `k * 2`.

Another example:
```
1
1000 10
```

The correct output could be:
```
YES
10
100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10
```

But the provided program would output "NO" for this case as well.

Thus, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and the answer is **False**.
