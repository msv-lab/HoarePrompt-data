Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
2. `t` is a positive integer (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
3. The conditions on `n` and `k` are:
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` equals `k`.
   - Otherwise, if `n + 2 > k * 2`, then `n` satisfies this condition.
   - Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a single `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`. The value of `'YES'` is explicitly given and does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
