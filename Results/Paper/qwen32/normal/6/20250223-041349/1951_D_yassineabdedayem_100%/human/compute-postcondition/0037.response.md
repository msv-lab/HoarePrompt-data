The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `k`, and `t`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly given as `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(1)`.
2. The value `1` is an explicit integer and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state.
3. Since the `print` statement directly outputs the integer `1`, no further calculations or variable substitutions are needed.

Output: **1**
