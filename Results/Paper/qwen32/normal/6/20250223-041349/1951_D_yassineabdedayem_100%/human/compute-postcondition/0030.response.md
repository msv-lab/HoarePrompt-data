The code provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t` is a positive integer. The conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `k` are not affected by the reading of input values; they remain as stated.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t` is a positive integer. The conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `k` remain unchanged.**
