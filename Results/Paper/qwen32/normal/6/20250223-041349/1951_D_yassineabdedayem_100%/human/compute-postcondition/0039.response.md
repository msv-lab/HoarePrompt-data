Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t` is a positive integer. The conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `k` remain unchanged. If `n + 2 > k * 2`, the conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `k` remain unchanged.**

Since both the if part and the else part do not alter the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`, and the conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `k` remain unchanged in both cases, the overall postcondition reflects that no changes are made to these variables or their relationships.
