The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is solely determined by the `print(2)` statement itself.

Thus, the output will be the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
