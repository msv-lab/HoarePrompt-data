To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` and `k` are integers.
- `t` is a positive integer (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the initial state).
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n + 2 > k * 2`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output the value of the expression `n - k + 1`.
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that a space should be printed at the end instead of the default newline character.

### Values of Variables:
- `n` and `k` are integers that satisfy `n + 2 > k * 2` and `n â‰  k`.
- The exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, so we can't compute a specific numerical result. However, we can describe the expression in terms of `n` and `k`.

### Expression Evaluation:
- The expression `n - k + 1` can be evaluated using the values of `n` and `k`.
- Given that `n + 2 > k * 2`, we can infer that `n` is sufficiently larger than `k` to satisfy this inequality.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `n - k + 1` followed by a space.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are integers satisfying n + 2 > k * 2 and n â‰  k)**
