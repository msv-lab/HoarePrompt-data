The code snippet provided is:

```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know that `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t` is a positive integer. However, the value of `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can disregard it for this particular output.

The expression `n - k + 1` is evaluated and printed. Since the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

The expression `n - k + 1` calculates the result of subtracting `k` from `n` and then adding 1 to the result.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are integers read from the input)**
