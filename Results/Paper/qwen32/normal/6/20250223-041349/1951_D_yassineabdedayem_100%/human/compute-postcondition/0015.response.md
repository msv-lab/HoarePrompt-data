Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is a positive integer, and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `n + 2 > k * 2`, then `n` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables `n`, `k`, and `t` after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the conditions and their respective outcomes.
