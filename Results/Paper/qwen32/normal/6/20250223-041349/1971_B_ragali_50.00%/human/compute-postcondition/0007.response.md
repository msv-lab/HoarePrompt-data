The code snippet `a.add(i)` adds the character `i` to the set `a`. Initially, `a` contains the element `i`. After executing the code, `a` will still contain `i`, but there will be no duplicate entries since `a` is a set and sets do not allow duplicate elements. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a string that is the input stripped of leading and trailing spaces and must have at least 1 character; `a` is a set containing the element `i`; `i` is the next character in the string `s`.**
