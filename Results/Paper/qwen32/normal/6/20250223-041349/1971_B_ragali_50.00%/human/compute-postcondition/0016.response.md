Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `s` is a string that is the input stripped of leading and trailing spaces.
3. `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`, and the length of the set `a` is greater than 1.
4. `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `newstr` is not equal to `s`.
5. `isreverse` is the reverse of the string `s`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
```

### Analysis:
- The expression `s[len(s) // 2:]` extracts the second half of the string `s`.
- The expression `s[:len(s) // 2]` extracts the first half of the string `s`.
- The `+` operator concatenates these two halves.

Given that `newstr` is defined as `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]` and is explicitly stated to be not equal to `s`, we can deduce that the print statement will output the value of `newstr`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `newstr`, which is the concatenation of the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **newstr (where newstr is the concatenation of the second half of s with the first half of s)**
