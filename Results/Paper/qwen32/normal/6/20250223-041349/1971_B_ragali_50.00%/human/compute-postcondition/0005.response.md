The code snippet `a.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty set, after this operation, `a` will contain the element `i`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a string that is the input stripped of leading and trailing spaces and must have at least 1 character; `a` is a set containing the element `i`.**
