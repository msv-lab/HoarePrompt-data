Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i; num2 is an integer representing the length of the list a, such that num2 == len(a); order is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, num2):
    if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
        order += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers where `2 <= len(a) <= 100` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` such that `num2 == len(a)`. If `a[i - 1] >= a[i]`, then `order` is 1; otherwise, `order` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers where `2 <= len(a) <= 100` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` such that `num2 == len(a)`. If `a[i - 1] >= a[i]`, then `order` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `order` remains unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers where `2 <= len(a) <= 100` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` such that `num2 == len(a)`. If `a[i - 1] >= a[i]`, then `order` is incremented by 1. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
