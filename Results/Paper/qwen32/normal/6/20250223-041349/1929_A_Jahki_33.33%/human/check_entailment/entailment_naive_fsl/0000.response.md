Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function and the way it handles the calculation of beauty. 

The `func_1` function is supposed to check if the array is already in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`, and the program incorrectly outputs `0` for the beauty. However, the beauty should be calculated even if the array is already in non-decreasing order.

Additionally, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed because it checks for non-decreasing order but returns `True` (indicating no need to calculate beauty) when the array is in non-decreasing order, which is incorrect. The beauty should always be calculated regardless of the initial order of the array.

Here is a specific case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Actual Output:
```
0
```

In this case, the array is already in non-decreasing order, but the beauty should still be calculated as `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `0` because the `func_1` function returns `True`.

To fix the program, the `func_1` function should be removed, and the beauty should always be calculated by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.
