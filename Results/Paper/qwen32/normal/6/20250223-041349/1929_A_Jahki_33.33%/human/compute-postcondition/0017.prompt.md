You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i. num2 is an integer representing the length of the list a, such that num2 == len(a).
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers where `2 <= len(a) <= 100` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` such that `num2 == len(a)`. `order` is the count of times an element in `a` is greater than or equal to the next element in the list.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a` with a length between 2 and 100, where each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9, and an integer `num2` that represents the length of the list `a`. The function returns `True` in Case_1 and `False` in Case_2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns True

Case_2: The program returns False


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
