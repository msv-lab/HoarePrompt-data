To determine the final state of the loop, let's analyze the given loop and the states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = num2 - 1` (since `range(1, num2)` generates numbers from 1 to `num2 - 1`). During each iteration, it checks if the element at index `i-1` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i`. If this condition is true, it increments the `order` variable by 1.

The loop will run `num2 - 1` times, as `i` ranges from 1 to `num2 - 1`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `num2`.

Given the initial state and the described behavior of the loop, the final output state will be:

- `a` remains the same list of integers.
- `num2` remains the length of the list `a`.
- `order` will be the count of times an element in `a` is greater than or equal to the next element in the list.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where `2 <= len(a) <= 100` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` such that `num2 == len(a)`. `order` is the count of times an element in `a` is greater than or equal to the next element in the list.**

In simpler terms, the final state is that `a` and `num2` remain unchanged, and `order` counts how many times an element in the list `a` is not less than the following element.
