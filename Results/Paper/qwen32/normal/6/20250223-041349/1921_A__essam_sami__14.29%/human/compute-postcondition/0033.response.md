Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); the loop has executed `t` times; for each test case, the program has read four pairs of integers (`a`, `b`), (`c`, `d`), (`e`, `f`), and (`g`, `h`), calculated `n` as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\) and `x` as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\), and printed the smaller of `n` and `x`. The variable `steps` is equal to `t` after the loop completes.**

In simpler terms: The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it calculated the squared distances between two pairs of points and printed the smaller distance. After processing all test cases, the loop ends and `steps` equals `t`.
