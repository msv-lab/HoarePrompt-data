Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers obtained from the input; `n` is \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\); `x` is \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\); `x` is less than or equal to `n`**
