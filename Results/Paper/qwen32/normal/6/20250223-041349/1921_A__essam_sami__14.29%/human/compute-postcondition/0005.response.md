The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `g` and `h`, respectively. The other variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`, `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100); `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `c` and `d` are integers obtained from the input; `e` and `f` are integers obtained from the input; `g` and `h` are integers obtained from the input.**
