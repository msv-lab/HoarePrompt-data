You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, there are four lines containing the coordinates of the corners of a square (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000.

    #State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); the loop has executed `t` times; for each test case, the program has read four pairs of integers (`a`, `b`), (`c`, `d`), (`e`, `f`), and (`g`, `h`), calculated `n` as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\) and `x` as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\), and printed the smaller of `n` and `x`. The variable `steps` is equal to `t` after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly calculates the area of the square based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program first reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers, each representing the coordinates of one corner of the square.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the squared distance between the first pair of points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)` using the formula `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. This is stored in `n`.
   - It then calculates the squared distance between the second pair of points `(c, d)` and `(g, h)` using the formula `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. This is stored in `x`.

3. **Area Calculation**:
   - The program compares `x` and `n`. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length of the square can be determined by the maximum of these two squared distances. However, the program prints the minimum of `x` and `n` instead of the maximum.
   - The area of the square should be the square of the side length, which is the maximum of the two squared distances (`max(n, x)`), not the minimum.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly calculates the area of the square by printing the minimum of the two squared distances instead of the maximum. This is a logical error in the implementation.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
