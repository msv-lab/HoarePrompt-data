To determine what will be printed by the `print(x)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the calculations involved.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **Inputs:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)
   - `a` and `b`: Integers obtained from the input.
   - `c` and `d`: New integers obtained from the input.
   - `e` and `f`: Integers obtained from the most recent input.
   - `g` and `h`: Integers obtained from the input.

2. **Calculations:**
   - `n` is calculated as: \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\)
   - `x` is calculated as: \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\)

3. **Comparison:**
   - The code checks if `x` is greater than `n` and increments `steps` by 1 based on the comparison.
   - However, the comparison does not affect the value of `x` itself.

### Output Determination:

The `print(x)` statement will output the value of `x` which is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).

Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, `g`, and `h` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `x`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `x`.

### Final Answer:

Output: **x (where x is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\))**
