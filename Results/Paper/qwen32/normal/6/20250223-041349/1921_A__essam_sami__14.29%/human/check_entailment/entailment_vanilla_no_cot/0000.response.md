Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all possible inputs. The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then prints the smaller of the two distances. This does not necessarily correspond to the side length of the square, especially if the pairs of points chosen are not adjacent corners of the square.

To correctly determine the area of the square, we need to find the side length by calculating the distance between any two adjacent corners. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be found by taking the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent points.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]
        # Extract x and y coordinates
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in points]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in points]
        # Calculate side length
        side_length = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)  # or max(y_coords) - min(y_coords)
        # Calculate area
        area = side_length * side_length
        print(area)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x (or y) coordinates, and then computes the area by squaring the side length.
