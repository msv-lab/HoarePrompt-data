To determine what will be printed by the `print(n)` statement, let's break down the given information and the computations involved step by step.

### Initial State and Given Computations:
1. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
2. `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
3. `c` and `d` are integers obtained from the input.
4. `e` and `f` are integers obtained from the most recent input.
5. `n` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).
6. `x` is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\), where `g` and `h` are integers obtained from the input.
7. The comparison between `x` and `n` determines whether `x` is greater than `n` or less than or equal to `n`.
8. `steps` is incremented by 1.

### Focus on the `print(n)` Statement:
The variable `n` is computed as the sum of the squares of the differences between the coordinates `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`. Specifically:
\[ n = (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2 \]

### What Will Be Printed:
The `print(n)` statement will output the value of `n`, which is the squared Euclidean distance between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`.

### Output:
Output: **n (where n is the squared Euclidean distance between the points (a, b) and (e, f))**
