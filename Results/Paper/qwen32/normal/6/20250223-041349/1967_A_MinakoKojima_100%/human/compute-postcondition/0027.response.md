Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is not 0. If `k` is 0, `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `0 // (i + 1)`, and `res` is `n - 1 + 0 % (i + 1)` if `i` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains `n - 1`. If `k` is not 0, the loop or if statement is broken out of without changing `ans` and `res`.**
