Postcondition: **`ans` is the final accumulated value, `res` is the remaining count of unadjusted elements, `ans_list` includes the final `ans`, `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and `k` is 0. If `k` was not 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // n` and `res` is updated to the remaining count of unadjusted elements plus `k % n`.**
