Output State: **`ans` is `a[0] + dif`, `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 2`, `ans_list` includes `ans`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - dif`, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is decremented by 1, so `res` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
