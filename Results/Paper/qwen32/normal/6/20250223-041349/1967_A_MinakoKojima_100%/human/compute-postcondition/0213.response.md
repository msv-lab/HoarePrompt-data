Output State: **the loop will print each element in `ans_list` until all elements are printed.**

In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will have printed each element contained in `ans_list` exactly once, in the order they appear in the list. No further changes occur to `ans_list` or any other variables outside the loop.
