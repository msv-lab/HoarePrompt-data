The code snippet provided is `ans += dif`. This means that the value of `ans` will be increased by the value of `dif`. The values of `i`, `dif`, and `res` are not modified by this line of code directly, except for `res` if the condition `if dif is 0` was true before this line, which would have already decreased `res` by 1. Since the code snippet does not include the condition check, we assume `res` remains unchanged unless the condition was met before this line.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `dif` is `a[i + 3] - a[i + 2]`, `res` is decreased by 1 if `dif` was 0 before this line, `ans` is `ans + dif`**.
