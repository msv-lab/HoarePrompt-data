Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is also increased by `k % (i + 1)`.**
