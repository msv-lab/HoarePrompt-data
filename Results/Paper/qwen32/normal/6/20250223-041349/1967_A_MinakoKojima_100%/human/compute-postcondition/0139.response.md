The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided, while the other variables (`ans`, `res`, `ans_list`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value achieved by adding differences from `a` while `k` is sufficient plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` plus `res`; `res` is unchanged; `ans_list` now includes `ans`; `n` and `k` are the integers provided by the input.**
