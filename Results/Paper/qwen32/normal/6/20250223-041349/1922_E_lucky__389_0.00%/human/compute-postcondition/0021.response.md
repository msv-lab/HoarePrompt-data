Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is non-zero; `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been updated to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
