The code snippet `mx = max(mx, i)` compares the current value of `mx` with the value of `i` and assigns the larger of the two to `mx`. Given that `mx` is either 0 or 59, and `i` is 58, the comparison will result in `mx` remaining 59 because 59 is greater than 58.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 2^58; `subseq_lens` is [58]; `mx` is 59; `i` is 58 and not equal to 0.**
