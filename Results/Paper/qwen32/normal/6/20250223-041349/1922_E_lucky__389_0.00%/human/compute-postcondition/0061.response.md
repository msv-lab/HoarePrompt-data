Let's analyze the given initial state to understand what will be printed by the `print(len(ansv))` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Variables and their Definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable is not directly used in the provided print statement, so its value is irrelevant for this specific print statement.
   - `X`: An integer such that \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `x`: Initialized to 0. This variable is also not directly used in the provided print statement.
   - `subseq_lens`: A list containing the sequence of powers of 2 that were subtracted from `X-1` in descending order.
   - `mx`: The largest power of 2 that was used in the process of constructing `subseq_lens`.
   - `ansv`: A list consisting of all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first element.

2. **Understanding `subseq_lens` and `ansv`:**
   - `subseq_lens` is constructed by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible power of 2 from `X-1` until `X-1` becomes 0. The powers of 2 used in this process are stored in `subseq_lens` in descending order.
   - `ansv` is a list that contains all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one. This means `ansv` will have one less element than `subseq_lens`.

### Calculation of `len(ansv)`

- The length of `subseq_lens` is the number of powers of 2 needed to sum up to `X-1`.
- Since `ansv` is `subseq_lens` without the first element, `len(ansv)` will be `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.

### Conclusion

The `print(len(ansv))` statement will output the length of the list `ansv`, which is one less than the number of powers of 2 required to sum up to `X-1`.

Output: **len(ansv) (where len(ansv) is one less than the number of powers of 2 required to sum up to X-1)**
