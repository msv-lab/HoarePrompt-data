Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find an array of integers such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The array should have a length of at most 200. If such an array does not exist, we should output -1.

### Key Points:
1. **Increasing Subsequences**: An increasing subsequence is a sequence of numbers in the array that are in strictly increasing order.
2. **Constraints**: The length of the array should be at most 200, and the elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
3. **Output Requirements**: For each test case, either print -1 (if no such array exists) or the length of the array followed by the array itself.

### Program Analysis:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by constructing an array based on the binary representation of \( X-1 \). Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Adjusting \( X \)**: The program subtracts 1 from \( X \) to account for the empty subsequence.
3. **Finding Subsequence Lengths**: The program calculates the lengths of increasing subsequences by finding the powers of 2 that sum up to \( X-1 \). This is done by repeatedly finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \) and subtracting it from \( X \).
4. **Constructing the Array**: The program constructs the array based on the calculated subsequence lengths. It starts with a sequence of increasing integers up to the maximum subsequence length and then appends the lengths of the subsequences.
5. **Output**: The program prints the length of the constructed array followed by the array itself.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of \( X = 2 \)**: For \( X = 2 \), the program should output an array with exactly one element because there are two increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the single-element subsequence. However, the program outputs an array with one element but does not handle this case correctly because it does not account for the possibility of having exactly one increasing subsequence (the array itself).
2. **General Case**: The program does not ensure that the constructed array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The logic for constructing the array based on subsequence lengths is flawed and does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where \( X \) is very large or when the constructed array exceeds the length limit of 200.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the constructed array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences and does not handle edge cases properly.

**Correctness: False**
