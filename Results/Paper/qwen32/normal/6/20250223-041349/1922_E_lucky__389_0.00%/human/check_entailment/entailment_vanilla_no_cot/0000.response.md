Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly generate an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences for the given X. The logic used in the program is flawed and does not construct the array in a way that satisfies the problem's requirements.

Here are some key issues:
1. The program attempts to decompose X into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1, which is not directly related to the problem of constructing an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.
2. The constructed array `ansv` does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X.
3. The program does not handle all edge cases or provide the correct output format for all valid inputs.

To solve the problem correctly, a different approach is needed, such as using combinatorial methods to construct an array with the desired number of increasing subsequences.
