Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 2^58; `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is 58. If `i` was 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` is [58] and `mx` is 59.**
