The code snippet updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Given that `mx` is initially either 0 or 59, and `i` is 58, the maximum value will be 59.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 2^58 - (2^58 - 1); `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer 58; `mx` is 59; `i` is 58 and not equal to 0.**
