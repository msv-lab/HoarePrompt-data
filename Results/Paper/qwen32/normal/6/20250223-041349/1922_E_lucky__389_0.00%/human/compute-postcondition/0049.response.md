The value of `x` is decremented by `2 ** i - 1`. Given that `i` is 58, the expression `2 ** i - 1` evaluates to `2 ** 58 - 1`. Therefore, `x` becomes `x - (2 ** 58 - 1)`.

The values of `t`, `X`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 2^58 - (2^58 - 1); `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer 58; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is 58 and not equal to 0.** 

In simpler terms, `x` is now at least 1.
