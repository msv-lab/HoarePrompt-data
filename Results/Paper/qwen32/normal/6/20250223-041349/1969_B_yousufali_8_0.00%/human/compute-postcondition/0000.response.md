The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `t`. Given that the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, the value of `t` will be updated to whatever positive integer value is input by the user, still satisfying the condition 1 <= t <= 10^4.

Output State: **`t` is the positive integer input by the user, such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**
