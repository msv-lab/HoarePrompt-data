The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted in terms of its value, as it is not used within the loop body. The loop's continuation depends on the range determined by `t`.

Given that the loop has just completed an iteration, the state of `t` remains unchanged since it is used to determine the number of iterations rather than being modified within the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than the number of iterations that have already completed.

Since the loop variable `_` does not persist between iterations and is not relevant to the continuation of the loop, we only need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 from the previous state to reflect the current iteration count.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is a positive integer input by the user, such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and `func_1()` has been executed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer input by the user, such that 1 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4, `func_1()` has been executed.**
