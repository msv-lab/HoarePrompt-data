Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift of a substring of length `k` is `k`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads a binary string `s` as a list of integers.
   - It initializes `n` to 0 (to count the number of `1`s encountered) and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over the list `s`. If it encounters a `1`, it increments `n`.
   - If it encounters a `0` and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Function Summary
The summary for `func_2` is correct. It reads the number of test cases and processes each one by calling `func_1`.

### Logic Analysis
Let's analyze the logic in `func_1`:
- The function counts the number of `1`s encountered (`n`).
- When a `0` is encountered and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
- This logic does not correctly calculate the cost of cyclic shifts.

### Example Analysis
Consider the test case `101011`:
- The correct minimum cost to sort this string is 5, as shown in the problem description.
- However, `func_1` would not yield this result. Let's see why:
  - When `func_1` encounters the first `0` after `1`, it adds `1 + 1 = 2` to `ans`.
  - When `func_1` encounters the second `0` after `2` ones, it adds `2 + 1 = 3` to `ans`.
  - When `func_1` encounters the third `0` after `3` ones, it adds `3 + 1 = 4` to `ans`.
  - The total `ans` would be `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The logic in `func_1` is fundamentally flawed. It does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
