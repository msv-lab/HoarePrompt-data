You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, and n is an integer initialized to 0, and ans is an integer initialized to 0.
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: n is the count of 1s in the list, and ans is the sum of (length of each sequence of 1s + 1) for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of (length of each sequence of 1s + 1) for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `s` where each integer is either 0 or 1. It calculates and returns an integer `ans` which is the sum of (length of each sequence of 1s + 1) for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` from the input, then executes `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value explicitly as per the provided code.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Let's analyze the functions `func_1` and `func_2`:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads a binary string `s` as a list of integers.
   - It initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over the list `s`. If it encounters a `1`, it increments `n`.
   - If it encounters a `0` and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

The logic in `func_1` is incorrect for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The provided code does not correctly handle the cost calculation for cyclic shifts. The cost calculation should consider the length of the substring being shifted, which is not correctly implemented in `func_1`.

For example, consider the test case `101011`:
- The correct minimum cost to sort this string is 5, as shown in the problem description.
- However, the provided code would not yield this result. The code's logic is flawed and does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all possible cyclic shifts.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
