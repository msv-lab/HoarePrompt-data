The code snippet `ans += n + 1` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `n + 1`. The values of `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged by this statement.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and has at least 1 element.
- `n` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1, and it must be less than the length of `s`.

The output state will be:
Output State: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and has at least 1 element; `n` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is 1; `i` is incremented by 1, and it must be less than the length of `s`; `ans` is increased by `n + 1`.**
