The code snippet `a[i] += i + 1` increases the element at index `i` of the list `a` by the value of `i + 1`. Given the initial state, the list `a` originally has its `n`-th element increased by `n + 1`. After executing the code, the element at index `i` will be further increased by `i + 1`. The values of `n` and the other elements in the list `a` remain unchanged except for the element at index `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `n`-th element is increased by `n + 1` and the `i`-th element is increased by `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
