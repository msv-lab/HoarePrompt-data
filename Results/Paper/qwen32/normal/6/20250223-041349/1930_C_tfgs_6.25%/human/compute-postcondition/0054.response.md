Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`. If `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` contains `adv` elements calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`. If `i` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `adv`, `ans`, `cnt`, or `counter`.**
