Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`
- `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 1

The code snippet:
```python
cnt = n - len(a)
```

Since `a` is a list of `n` integers, `len(a)` is `n`. Therefore, `cnt` will be `n - n`, which is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 1, `cnt` is 0**.
