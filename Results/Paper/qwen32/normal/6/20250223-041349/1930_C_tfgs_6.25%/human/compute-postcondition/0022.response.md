Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the values `n - i - j`, `n - i - j`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `adv` must be greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to include an additional element, specifically `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state, except for `j` which has been incremented by 1.
