The code snippet `a[i] += i + 1` modifies the `i`-th element of the list `a` by adding `i + 1` to it. Given that `n` is greater than 0 and `a` is a list of `n` integers, the only change in the output state is that the `i`-th element of `a` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is increased by `i + 1`.**
