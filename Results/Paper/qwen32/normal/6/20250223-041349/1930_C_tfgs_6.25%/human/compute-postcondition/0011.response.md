Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 1.**

Natural language: The list `a` is now sorted in descending order, so the first element is `n`, the second element is `n-1`, and so on, down to the last element which is `1`. The `Counter` object `counter` remains unchanged as it still counts each unique element in `a` exactly once. The value of `n` remains the same.
