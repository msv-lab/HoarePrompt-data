Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i > 0`, `adv` is 0, `ans` contains `adv` elements where each element is `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from `0` to `adv - 1`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`.**
