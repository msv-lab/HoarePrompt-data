Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`. If `i > 0`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 1 except for `n - i + 1` which has a count of `1 - adv`, `cnt` is `0 - adv`, and `ans` is a list containing the values `[n - i - 0, n - i - 1, n - i - 2, ..., n - i - (adv - 1)]`, and `adv` is greater than 0. If `i <= 0`, `counter` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is an empty list.**
