Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer; `l` is a list of `n` zeros; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0.**

Explanation: The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code snippet. The variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are all initialized to 0.
