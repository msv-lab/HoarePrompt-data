The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer.**
