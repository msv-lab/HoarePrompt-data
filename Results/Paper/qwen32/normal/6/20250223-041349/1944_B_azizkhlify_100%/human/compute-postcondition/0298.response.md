Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state to determine the output:

Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is a list.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- The value at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is 2.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `a[i]`**: The value of `a[i]` is an integer from the list `a`. The specific value is not given, but it is an element of the list `a`.

2. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement outputs `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and does not add a newline at the end due to `end=' '`.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is an element of the list a)**
