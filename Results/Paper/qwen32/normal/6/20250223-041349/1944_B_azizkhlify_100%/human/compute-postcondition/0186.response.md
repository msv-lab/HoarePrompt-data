Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

Initial State: `res` must contain at least three elements, and `i` is the third element in `res`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `res`**: The list `res` must contain at least three elements. This means `res` could be something like `[a, b, c, ...]` where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the first, second, and third elements respectively.
2. **Understanding `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly defined as the third element in the list `res`. Therefore, `i` is `res[2]`.
3. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement prints the variable `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the third element of the list `res` followed by a space.

Since the exact elements of `res` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third element of the list `res`.

Output: **[i] (where i is the third element of the list `res`)**
