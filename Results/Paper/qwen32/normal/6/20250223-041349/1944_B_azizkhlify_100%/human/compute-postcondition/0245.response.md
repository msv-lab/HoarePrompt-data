The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. The value of `ul` does not affect the loop's execution and is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to the next integer, and `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
