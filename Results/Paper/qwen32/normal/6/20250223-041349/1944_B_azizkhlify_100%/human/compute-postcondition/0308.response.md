The code snippet `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `ur` is the previous value of `ur` plus 2.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, and if `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `ur` is the previous value of `ur` plus 2.**
