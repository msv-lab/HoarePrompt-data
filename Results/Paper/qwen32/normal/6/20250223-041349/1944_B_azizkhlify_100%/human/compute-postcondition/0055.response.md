Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0. If `re` equals `k`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `res` includes all elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1 up to the point where `re` equals `k`. Otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged.**
