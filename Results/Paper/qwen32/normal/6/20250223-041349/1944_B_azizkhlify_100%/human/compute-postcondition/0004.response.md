The code snippet `r = [0] * n` creates a new list `r` with `n` elements, all initialized to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer; `l` is a list of `n` zeros; `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**
