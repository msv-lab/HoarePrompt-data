The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` modifies the list `r` by setting the value at index `a[i] - 1` to 0. Given that the initial state specifies that the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is 2, this value is now changed to 0.

Output State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0, `a` is a list of integers.**
