To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, we need to analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. However, `t` is not directly used in the print statement.
- `n` is greater than 0. Again, `n` is not directly used in the print statement.
- `i` is incremented by 1. This implies that `i` has some initial value, but the exact value is not specified. It is incremented by 1 before the print statement.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `a` is a list or an array, but its contents are not specified in the initial state.
- `i` is an index that has been incremented by 1.

### Key Points:
- The value of `a[i]` depends on the value of `i` and the contents of the list `a`.
- Since `i` is incremented by 1, the exact value of `i` before the increment is not provided, so we can denote the initial value of `i` as `i_initial`. After the increment, `i` will be `i_initial + 1`.

### Output Description:
The output will be the element at index `i` (which is `i_initial + 1`) of the list `a`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the specific values of `a` and `i_initial` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables provided.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i] (where i is the incremented index and a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
