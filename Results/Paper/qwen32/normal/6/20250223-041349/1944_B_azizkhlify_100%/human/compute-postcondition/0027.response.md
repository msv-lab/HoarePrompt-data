Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `l[a[i] - 1]` is now 0, `ul` is 2, and `ur` is 0. Otherwise, `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged. `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 0. Additionally, `ul` is equal to `k * 2`.**
