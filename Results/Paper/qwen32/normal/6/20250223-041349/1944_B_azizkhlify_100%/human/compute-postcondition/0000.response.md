In the given task, the for loop iterates a number of times based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`, which reads an integer from the input. The variables `n`, `k`, and `a` are defined inside the loop body, so we cannot adjust them in the state before the loop starts.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1 because the loop will run `t` times. The value of `t` is already given as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 5000`, so no adjustment is needed for `t` itself. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that does not need to be initialized or adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**
