Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `res` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero, `l` has elements set to 0 where `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2 during the loop, `r` remains the same, `re` remains the same, `ul` is the total count of 2s encountered in `l[a[i] - 1]` times 2, `ur` remains the same, `i` is `n`.**
