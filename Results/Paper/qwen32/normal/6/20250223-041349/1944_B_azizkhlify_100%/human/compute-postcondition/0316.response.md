Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` is either 0 or 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `n + 2`. If the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` in `r` is 2, then `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` in `r` is 0.**
