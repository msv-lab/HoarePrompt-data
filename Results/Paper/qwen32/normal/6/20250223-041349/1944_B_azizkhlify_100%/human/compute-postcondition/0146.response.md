To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The description states that `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. This indicates that `i` is likely an index that is being incremented in a loop. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified, so we need to consider it as a symbolic value that has been incremented from its previous state.

2. **Variable `a`**: The variable `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we can assume that `a` is a list or array, and `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in this list or array.

3. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement prints `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Output Description:
- Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `a[i]`.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of the list `a` at index `i`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
