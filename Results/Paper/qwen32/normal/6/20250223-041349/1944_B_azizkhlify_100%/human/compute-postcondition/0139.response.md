To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than 0.
2. `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `a` is a list, but its contents are not specified in the initial state.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1, which means `i` is now pointing to the second element of the list `a` (assuming `i` was initially 0).
- The `print` statement attempts to print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Output Determination:
- Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot provide the exact numerical values of `a[i]`.
- However, we know that `i` is 1 (assuming it was 0 initially and then incremented by 1).
- Therefore, `a[i]` refers to the second element of the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the second element of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list a)**
