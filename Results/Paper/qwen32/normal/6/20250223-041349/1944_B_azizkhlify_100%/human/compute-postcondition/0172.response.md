To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than 1.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `res` contains `a[0]`.
4. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, then `res` also contains `a[1]` and `re` is incremented by 1.
5. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
6. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `re` or the loop continues.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- The `print` statement is printing `a[i]`, which translates to `a[2]` because `i` is 2.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function ensures that a space is added after the printed value instead of the default newline character.

### Output:
The code will print the value of `a[2]` followed by a space.

Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical value of `a[2]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print` statement will output the value of `a[2]`.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
