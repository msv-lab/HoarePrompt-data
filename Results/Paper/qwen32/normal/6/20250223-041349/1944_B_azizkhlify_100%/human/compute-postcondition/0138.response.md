The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. The value of `ul` does not affect the loop's continuation and is only mentioned in the context of the loop body, which is omitted.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound for the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
