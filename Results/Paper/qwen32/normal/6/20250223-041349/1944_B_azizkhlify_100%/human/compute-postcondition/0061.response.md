Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `re` equals `k + 1` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` and `re` was equal to `k`, or `re + 1` if `re` was not equal to `k`, and `res` includes all elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1 up to the point where `re` equals `k` or remains unchanged. Additionally, if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, `res` now also includes `a[i]`. The loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simple terms, the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `re`, and `res` retain their values as described in the initial state, except that the loop or if statement is exited.
