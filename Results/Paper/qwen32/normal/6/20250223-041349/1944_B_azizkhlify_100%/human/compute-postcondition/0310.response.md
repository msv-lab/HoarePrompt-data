Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 or 2, `a` is a list of integers, `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `r`, `a`, `ul`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `ur` also remains unchanged. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
