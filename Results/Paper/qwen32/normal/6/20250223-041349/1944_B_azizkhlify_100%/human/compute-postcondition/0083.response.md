Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- Since `i` is equal to `n`, the expression `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[n]`.
- The `print` statement will output `a[n]` twice, followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).
- The value of `a[n]` is not explicitly provided, but we can refer to it as `a[n]`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `a[n]` twice, separated by a space.

### Final Answer:
Output: **a[n] a[n] (where a[n] is the value of the element at index n in the list a)**
