The code snippet `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` modifies the list `l` by incrementing the element at the index `a[i] - 1` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so the element at index `a[2] - 1` in the list `l` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l[a[2] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
