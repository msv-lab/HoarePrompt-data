Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `res` has an additional element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero, `l` has elements set to 0 where `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2 during the loop, and if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, it is also set to 0, `r` remains the same, `re` is incremented by 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `ul` is the total count of 2s encountered in `l[a[i] - 1]` times 2, `ur` remains the same. If `re` equals `k`, the loop is terminated.**
