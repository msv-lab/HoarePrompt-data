The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range `n` to `2 * n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `n`. The variable `n` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the range.

Since the change only affects `i`, and `n` is a given constant for the range, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

However, since `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented within the loop body, which is omitted, it is not relevant to the state at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, the correct state should exclude the effect of the loop body on `r[a[i] - 1]`:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`.**
