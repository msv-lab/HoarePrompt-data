The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input.**
