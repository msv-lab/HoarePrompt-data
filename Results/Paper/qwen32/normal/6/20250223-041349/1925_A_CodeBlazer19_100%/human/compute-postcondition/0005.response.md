The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, and `i` is `i + 1`. The values of `n` and `k` from the initial state are overwritten by the new input values. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `k`, while `t` and the updated `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676; `n` is the first integer from the new input; `k` is the second integer from the new input; `i` is `i + 1`**.
