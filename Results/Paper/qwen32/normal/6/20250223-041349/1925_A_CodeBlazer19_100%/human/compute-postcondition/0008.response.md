The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer between 1 and 676, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `i` is incremented by 2.

After executing the code, the value of `i` is no longer `i + 2` because the code does not modify `i`. The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k`, and `i` remains as it was before the code snippet was executed but incremented by 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676; `n` is the first integer from the new input; `k` is the second integer from the new input; `i` is the initial value of `i` plus 2.**
