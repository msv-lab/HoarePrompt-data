To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case. The loop processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and then computes and prints a value based on these integers.

The loop processes all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it computes the output using the provided formula:
```python
(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)
```
Let's break down the formula:
- `(k // 2 + k % 2)` computes the ceiling of `k / 2`.
- `(k < 4 * n - 3)` evaluates to 1 if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`, otherwise 0.
- `(k >= 4 * n - 3)` evaluates to 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `4 * n - 3`, otherwise 0.
- `(k == 4 * n - 2)` evaluates to 1 if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, otherwise 0.

The loop processes each test case independently and prints the result. Since the loop processes all `t` test cases, the final output state is the concatenation of the results of each test case.

Given that the loop processes all `t` test cases, the final output state is simply the concatenation of the results of each test case, each printed on a new line.

Output State: **the concatenation of the results of each test case, each printed on a new line.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all iterations, the output will be a series of lines, each corresponding to the result of processing one test case. Each line will contain the computed value based on the formula provided for the respective `n` and `k` values of that test case.
