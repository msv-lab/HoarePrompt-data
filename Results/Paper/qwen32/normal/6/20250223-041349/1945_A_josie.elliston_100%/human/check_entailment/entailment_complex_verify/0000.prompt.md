You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three non-negative integer parameters representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it handles all the edge cases correctly according to the problem description.

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`: This function attempts to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
2. `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`: This function uses `func_1` to calculate the total number of tents required or returns `-1` if it's not possible.

Let's break down the logic:

- `func_1` checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3. If not, it checks if the remainder of extroverts plus universals can form a group of 3. If not, it returns `None`.
- `func_2` calls `func_1` and if `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the sum.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
1. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and there are not enough universals to form a group of 3 with the remaining extroverts.
2. The function `func_1` does not consider the possibility of forming smaller groups with universals if the extroverts cannot be perfectly divided into groups of 3.

Let's consider an example case:
- Suppose we have `a = 0`, `b = 2`, and `c = 1`.
  - According to the problem description, we need 1 tent for the two extroverts and the one universal (since 2 extroverts and 1 universal can form a group of 3).
  - However, `func_1` will return `None` because `2 % 3 != 0` and `2 % 3 + 1 < 3` is `True`. This will result in `func_2` returning `-1`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the provided code does not handle all cases correctly, and we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
