Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in the function `func_1` is intended to find the smallest index `l` such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `l` is `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in `array`. However, the loop condition `while l <= r` is incorrect for this purpose. It should be `while l < r` to correctly narrow down the search space. The current loop condition can lead to an infinite loop in some cases.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The function is supposed to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. However, the current implementation only performs a single swap if `l` is not the index of `find`. This is not sufficient to guarantee the correct result for all cases.

3. **Output Format**: The function is supposed to return the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped. However, it currently prints the number of swaps and returns the indices, which is not consistent with the problem's requirements. The function should return a string in the required format.

Based on these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
