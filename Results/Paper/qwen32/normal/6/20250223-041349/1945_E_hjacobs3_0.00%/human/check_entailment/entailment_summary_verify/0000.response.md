### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem requirements and the provided program code in conjunction with the function summary and the original assessment.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: 
   - A permutation `p` of size `n`.
   - A number `x` to be found.
2. **Output**: 
   - The number of swaps `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 2).
   - The indices of the elements to be swapped if `k > 0`.
3. **Objective**: 
   - Rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that after performing a binary search, `p[l]` equals `x`.

#### Program Code Analysis:
The given code attempts to solve the problem using a binary search but does not correctly handle the swapping logic as required by the problem statement.

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search is implemented with the condition `while l <= r`, which is incorrect. The correct condition should be `while l < r` as per the problem description.
   - The assignment of `l` and `r` based on the comparison of `array[mid]` with `find` is also incorrect. The correct assignments should be:
     - If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l = mid`.
     - Otherwise, `r = mid`.

2. **Handling Swaps**:
   - The code only considers one swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array. However, the problem allows up to two swaps.
   - The code does not explore the possibility of using two swaps to achieve the desired result.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The output format of the swaps is incorrect. The problem requires the output of the number of swaps followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - The code only prints `1` and the indices of the elements to be swapped, but it does not handle the case where two swaps are needed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where `x` is already at the correct position or where `x` needs to be moved to the correct position using two swaps.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1` but does not address the issues related to the binary search implementation and the handling of swaps.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the code:
1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps**.
3. **Output Format**.
4. **Edge Cases**.

The counterexample provided in the original assessment demonstrates that the code does not work correctly for certain inputs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to perform at most two swaps to make the binary search algorithm find the number `x` at the correct position. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
