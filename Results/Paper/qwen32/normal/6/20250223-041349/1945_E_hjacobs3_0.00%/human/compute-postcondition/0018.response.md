Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`. `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`). `n` is the length of `array`. `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`. If `array[mid] >= find`, then `r` is set to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Ensure `l` is less than or equal to `r` for the loop to execute again. Adjust `l` and `r` such that `l` is not greater than `r`. If `l` is greater than `r`, set `l` to `r`.**
