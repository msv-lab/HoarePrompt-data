Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] < find` to correctly update the `l` and `r` pointers. The current implementation does not correctly narrow down the search space.

2. **Handling of Output**: The function `func_1` is expected to return a list of strings representing the operations needed to make `p_l` equal to `x` after the binary search. However, the function currently prints the number of operations and returns the indices directly, which does not match the expected output format.

3. **Logic for Swapping Elements**: The logic for determining when to swap elements is incorrect. The function does not ensure that after performing up to 2 swaps, the binary search will result in `p_l` being equal to `x`. It only checks if the current `l` is not equal to the index of `x` and performs a single swap. This is not sufficient to guarantee the correct result in all cases.

4. **Return Format**: The function should return a list of strings representing the operations, but it currently prints the number of operations and returns a list of indices. The main loop in the program prints the result of `func_1`, which is incorrect if `func_1` prints the number of operations.

5. **Correctness of the Solution**: The problem requires that after performing up to 2 swaps, the binary search should result in `p_l` being equal to `x`. The current implementation does not guarantee this, as it only performs a single swap if necessary.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly implement the binary search, determine the necessary swaps to ensure `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search, and format the output correctly.
