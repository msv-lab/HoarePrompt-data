Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`. `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`). `n` is assigned the value of the length of `array`. `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`. If `array[mid] >= find`, then `r` is set to `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is set to `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`.**
