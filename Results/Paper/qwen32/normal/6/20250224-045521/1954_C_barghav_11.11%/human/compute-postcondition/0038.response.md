To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `a` is a list with at least one element.
2. `b` is a list where the first half contains the minimum values and the second half contains the maximum values from the original `a` and `b` pairs.
3. `i` is set to 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
- `a` is a list with at least one element. This means `a` could be something like `[x0, x1, x2, ...]`, where `x0`, `x1`, `x2`, etc., are the elements of the list.
- `i` is set to 1, so `a[i]` refers to the element at index 1 of the list `a`.
- The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that no newline character is added after the printed value.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the second element of the list `a`.
- The exact value of `a[i]` depends on the specific elements of the list `a`, but we know it is the element at index 1.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the element at index 1 of the list `a`, without a newline character at the end.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
