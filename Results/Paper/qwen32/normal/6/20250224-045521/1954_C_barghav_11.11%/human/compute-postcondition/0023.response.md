Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; additionally, `x` and `y` have the same length for each test case; `a` is a list of characters representing the input and `b` is a list of characters representing the new input. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, `a[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, `a[i]` is updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is updated to the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, while `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
