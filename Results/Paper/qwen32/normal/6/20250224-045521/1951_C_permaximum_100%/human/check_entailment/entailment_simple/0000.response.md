### Reasoning:

The provided program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price, which is a greedy strategy that ensures the minimum cost for purchasing tickets. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The prices are stored in a priority queue (min-heap), where each element is a tuple containing the price and the index of the day.
   - `total_cost` is initialized to 0, representing the cumulative cost of tickets bought.
   - `tickets_bought` is initialized to 0, representing the number of tickets purchased so far.
   - `price_increase` is initialized to 0, representing the cumulative increase in prices due to previous purchases.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, the day with the lowest current price (adjusted by `price_increase`) is selected using `heapq.heappop`.
   - `tickets_to_buy` is determined as the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought in a day) and `k - tickets_bought` (the remaining tickets needed).
   - The cost of buying `tickets_to_buy` tickets on the selected day is added to `total_cost`.
   - `tickets_bought` is incremented by `tickets_to_buy`.
   - `price_increase` is incremented by `tickets_to_buy`, reflecting the increase in prices for subsequent days.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates once `tickets_bought` equals `k`, and the function returns `total_cost`.

### Correctness:

The greedy approach ensures that tickets are always bought at the lowest possible price, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of a priority queue allows efficient retrieval of the day with the lowest price, and the cumulative price increase correctly adjusts the prices as tickets are bought.

Given the provided example cases and the logic of the program, it correctly computes the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
