#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), prices is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9); `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the tuples that were popped; `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets with the adjusted prices; `tickets_bought` is `k`; `price_increase` is the cumulative sum of `tickets_to_buy` over all iterations.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns total_cost, which is the sum of the costs of buying k tickets with the adjusted prices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where each ticket can be one of `n` types with initial prices given in the list `prices`. The tickets are bought in batches of up to `m` tickets per type, and the price of each ticket type increases by the number of tickets bought from that type. The function returns the total cost after purchasing the required number of tickets.
