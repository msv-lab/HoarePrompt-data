The only variable in the loop head is `tickets_bought`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `tickets_bought` is less than `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k) * 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`.

Since `tickets_bought` is currently `min(m, k) * 2`, it will be less than `k` only if `min(m, k) * 2 < k`. This inequality holds true only when `min(m, k) < k/2`. If `min(m, k)` is equal to `k`, then `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k * 2`, which is not less than `k`.

To ensure that `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, we need to adjust `tickets_bought` to be less than `k`. Given that `tickets_bought` is currently `min(m, k) * 2`, we can adjust it to be `min(m, k)` (or any value less than `k` but greater than or equal to `0`).

However, to adhere strictly to the requirement of modifying only the states of objects in the loop head, we should adjust `tickets_bought` to be `min(m, k) - 1` (as long as `min(m, k) > 0`), ensuring that `tickets_bought` is still less than `k`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9); `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple; `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k) - 1`; `price_increase` is `min(m, k)`; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list; `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k)`**
