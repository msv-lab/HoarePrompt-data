You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    return total_cost
    #The program returns total_cost, which is the sum of the costs of buying k tickets with the adjusted prices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where each ticket can be one of `n` types with initial prices given in the list `prices`. The tickets are bought in batches of up to `m` tickets per type, and the price of each ticket type increases by the number of tickets bought from that type. The function returns the total cost after purchasing the required number of tickets.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the requirement that after purchasing `x` tickets on day `i`, the prices for all subsequent days are increased by `x`. The code correctly identifies the cheapest available ticket price and buys up to `m` tickets on that day, but it does not update the prices for subsequent days after the purchase. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the total cost.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3 1 3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Day 1: Buy 1 ticket for 1 (total cost = 1). Prices become [2, 3, 4].
- Day 2: Buy 1 ticket for 3 (total cost = 1 + 3 = 4). Prices become [4, 5, 6].
- Day 3: Buy 1 ticket for 6 (total cost = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10).

However, the code will output `6` because it does not account for the price increase after each purchase.

**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
6
```

The code does not update the prices in the priority queue after each purchase, so it incorrectly calculates the total cost.

To fix this, the code should reinsert the updated price back into the priority queue after each purchase. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Reinsert the updated price back into the priority queue
        if day < n - 1:
            heapq.heappush(pq, (prices[day + 1] + price_increase, day + 1))
    return total_cost
```

This corrected version ensures that the prices are updated correctly after each purchase, leading to the correct total cost.
