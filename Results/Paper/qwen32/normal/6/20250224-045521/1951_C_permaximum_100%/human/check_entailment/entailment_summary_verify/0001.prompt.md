You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
    print(result)

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
    return total_cost



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where each ticket can be one of `n` types with initial prices given in the list `prices`. The tickets are bought in batches of up to `m` tickets per type, and the price of each ticket type increases by the number of tickets bought from that type. The function returns the total cost after purchasing the required number of tickets.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem using a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day, considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of days `n`, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day `m`, the total number of tickets to buy `k`, and the list of prices `prices`.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with tuples of the form `(price, day)`. This allows it to efficiently fetch the day with the lowest price.

3. **Buying Tickets**:
   - The program repeatedly pops the cheapest available day from the priority queue.
   - It calculates the current price on that day, considering any price increases due to previous purchases.
   - It determines the number of tickets to buy on that day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It updates the total cost, the number of tickets bought, and the price increase for subsequent days.

4. **Termination**: The loop continues until the required number of tickets `k` is bought.

### Analysis:

The algorithm follows a greedy approach by always buying tickets on the cheapest available day, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of a priority queue ensures that the cheapest day is always selected efficiently.

However, there are a few considerations:
- **Price Increase Handling**: The program correctly updates the price increase for each day after a purchase.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the number of tickets to buy is less than the maximum allowed per day (`m`), or when the prices are already very high.
- **Efficiency**: The use of a priority queue ensures that the program runs efficiently even for large inputs, with a time complexity of O(n log n) per test case due to the heap operations.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It makes optimal decisions at each step and handles the constraints appropriately.
