Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9); `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple and the tuple that was just popped; `total_cost` is `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `2 * min(m, k) - 2`; `price_increase` is `min(m, k) + tickets_to_buy`; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` after the pop plus `price_increase`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list after the pop; `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`**

Explanation: The value of `tickets_to_buy` is recalculated to be the minimum of `m` and the difference between `k` and `tickets_bought`. All other variables retain their previous values as specified in the initial state.
