The code snippet assigns the value of `min(m, k - tickets_bought)` to `tickets_to_buy`. Given the initial state, `tickets_bought` is 0, so `k - tickets_bought` is simply `k`. Therefore, `tickets_to_buy` will be the minimum of `m` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0, `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`, `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list, `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k)**.
