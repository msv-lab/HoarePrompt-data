The code snippet provided increments `price_increase` by the value of `tickets_to_buy`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9); `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple; `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k) * 2`; `price_increase` is `min(m, k)`; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list; `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k)**

In simpler terms, `price_increase` has been updated to be equal to `tickets_to_buy`, which is `min(m, k)`. All other variables retain their original values.
