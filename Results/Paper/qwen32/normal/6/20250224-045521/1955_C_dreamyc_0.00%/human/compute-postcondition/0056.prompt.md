You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `k` is the remaining value after all possible operations, `nums` contains the elements that were not fully processed, and `ans` is the count of elements that were fully processed and removed.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns ans + 1, where ans is the count of elements that were fully processed and removed.
    #State: `k` is the remaining value after all possible operations, `nums` contains the elements that were not fully processed, and `ans` is the count of elements that were fully processed and removed. Either `k` is 0, or the length of `nums` is not 1, or `k` is less than the first element of `nums`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the count of elements that were fully processed and removed, which is stored in the variable `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`; `k`, which is an integer representing a threshold value; and `nums`, which is a list of `n` integers. The function processes the elements in `nums` and counts how many elements are fully processed and removed. In Case_1, if a certain condition is met, the function returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the count of fully processed and removed elements. In Case_2, the function returns `ans`, the count of fully processed and removed elements.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns ans + 1, where ans is the count of elements that were fully processed and removed.

Case_2: The program returns the count of elements that were fully processed and removed, which is stored in the variable `ans`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
