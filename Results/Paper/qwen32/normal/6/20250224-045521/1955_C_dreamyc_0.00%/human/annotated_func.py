#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns ans + 1, where ans is the count of elements that were fully processed and removed.
    #State: `k` is the remaining value after all possible operations, `nums` contains the elements that were not fully processed, and `ans` is the count of elements that were fully processed and removed. Either `k` is 0, or the length of `nums` is not 1, or `k` is less than the first element of `nums`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the count of elements that were fully processed and removed, which is stored in the variable `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `nums` by repeatedly removing the smallest possible pairs of elements until a threshold `k` is exhausted or no more pairs can be removed. It returns the count of elements that were fully processed and removed. If there is one element left and `k` is still sufficient to remove it, it includes this element in the count.
