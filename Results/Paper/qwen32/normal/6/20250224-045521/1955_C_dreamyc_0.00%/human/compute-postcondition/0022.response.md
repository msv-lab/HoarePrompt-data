To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both `k` is non-zero and the length of `nums` is at least 2.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15.
- `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers.
- `a` and `b` are the first and last elements of the original `nums`, respectively.
- `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.
- If `a` is greater than 0, `nums` includes `a` and the original `nums` elements.
- If `b` > 0 and `k` >= 2 * `x`, then `a` and `b` are each decreased by `x`.
- `ans` is 0 if `b` > 0, otherwise `ans` is 2.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that both `k` is non-zero and `len(nums)` is at least 2. Since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`k` and `len(nums)`), we need to ensure these conditions are met.

### Analysis:
1. **`k` must be non-zero**: If `k` is zero, the loop will terminate. Therefore, we need to ensure `k` is greater than zero.
2. **`len(nums)` must be at least 2**: If `len(nums)` is less than 2, the loop will terminate. Therefore, we need to ensure `len(nums)` is at least 2.

### Adjustments:
- `k` should be greater than 0.
- `len(nums)` should be at least 2.

Given the initial conditions and the fact that `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers, and `n` is at least 2, it is possible that `len(nums)` could be 1 if the loop body modifies `nums` in a way that reduces its length. Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 2.

### Final State:
State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `len(nums)` must be at least 2**.
