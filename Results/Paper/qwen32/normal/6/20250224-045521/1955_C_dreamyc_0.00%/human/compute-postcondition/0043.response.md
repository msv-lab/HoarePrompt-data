Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` minus `x` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `a` remains the first element of the original `nums`. `b` is the last element of the original `nums` minus `x` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `b` remains the last element of the original `nums`. `nums` has at least 0 elements and is missing its first and last elements from the original state. `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b` in the original state. If `k < 2 * x`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
