Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first element that was removed from `nums`, `b` is the last element that was removed from `nums`, `len(nums)` is at least 1, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
