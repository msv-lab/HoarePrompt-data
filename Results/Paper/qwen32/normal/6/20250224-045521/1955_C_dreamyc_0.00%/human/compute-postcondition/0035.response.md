Postcondition: **`k` is greater than 0; `a` is the first element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `a` remains the first element that was removed from `nums`; `b` is the last element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `b` remains the last element that was removed from `nums`; `len(nums)` is at least 1; `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`; if `a > 0`, the first element of `nums` is `a`; if `a <= 0`, `ans` is increased by 1; if `b > 0`, `nums` now includes `b` as its last element; if `b <= 0`, `ans` is increased by 1.**
