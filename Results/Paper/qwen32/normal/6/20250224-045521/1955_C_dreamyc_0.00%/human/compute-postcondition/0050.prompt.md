Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
    x = min(a, b)
    if k >= 2 * x:
        a -= x
        b -= x
        k -= 2 * x
    else:
        break
    if a > 0:
        nums.appendleft(a)
    else:
        ans += 1
    if b > 0:
        nums.append(b)
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers where the first element is `a` and the remaining `n-2` integers are the original elements of `nums` followed by `b` if `b` is greater than 0, otherwise `nums` is a deque of `n-2` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. `a` and `b` are the first and last elements of the original `nums`, respectively. `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than 0, `nums` includes `a` and the original `nums` elements. If `b` > 0 and `k` >= 2 * `x`, then `a` and `b` are each decreased by `x`. `ans` is 0 if `b` > 0, otherwise `ans` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `k` is greater than 0; `a` is the first element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `a` remains the first element that was removed from `nums`; `b` is the last element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `b` remains the last element that was removed from `nums`; `len(nums)` is at least 1; `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`; if `a > 0`, the first element of `nums` is `a`; if `a <= 0`, `ans` is increased by 1; if `b > 0`, `nums` now includes `b` as its last element; if `b <= 0`, `ans` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `k` is greater than 0, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` minus `x` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `a` remains the first element of the original `nums`. `b` is the last element of the original `nums` minus `x` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `b` remains the last element of the original `nums`. If `b > 0`, `b` is appended to `nums`. If `a > 0`, `nums` has at least 1 element with `a` as the first element and is missing its last element from the original state. If `a <= 0`, `nums` has at least 0 elements and is missing its first and last elements from the original state, and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `b <= 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1. `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b` in the original state. If `k < 2 * x`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
