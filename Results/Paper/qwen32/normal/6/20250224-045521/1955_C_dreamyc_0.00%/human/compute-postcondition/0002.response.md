To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head: `k` and `len(nums) >= 2`.

1. **Variable `k`:**
   - The condition `k` implies that `k` must be a non-zero value.
   - Given that `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= 10^15`, it already satisfies the condition of being non-zero. No adjustment is needed for `k`.

2. **Variable `len(nums)`:**
   - The condition `len(nums) >= 2` implies that the length of the deque `nums` must be at least 2.
   - Given that `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, the condition `len(nums) >= 2` can be satisfied if `n` is at least 2. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

Since `k` is already guaranteed to be non-zero, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 2, which means `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `ans` is 0**
