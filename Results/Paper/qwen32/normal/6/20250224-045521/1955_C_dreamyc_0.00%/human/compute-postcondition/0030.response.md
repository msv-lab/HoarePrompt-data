The code snippet appends the value of `a` to the left end of the deque `nums`. Therefore, the first element of `nums` will now be `a`, and all other elements will be shifted to the right.

Given the initial state conditions:
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `a` is the first element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b` if `k >= 2 * x`; otherwise, `a` remains the first element that was removed from `nums`.
- `b` is the last element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b` if `k >= 2 * x`; otherwise, `b` remains the last element that was removed from `nums`.
- `len(nums)` is at least 1.
- `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.
- If `k < 2 * x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

After appending `a` to the left of `nums`, `nums` will have `a` as its first element, and the rest of the elements will remain in their original order.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `a` is the first element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `a` remains the first element that was removed from `nums`; `b` is the last element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `b` remains the last element that was removed from `nums`; `len(nums)` is at least 1 and the first element of `nums` is `a`; `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**
