The code snippet removes the first element from the deque `nums` and assigns it to `a`, and removes the last element from the deque `nums` and assigns it to `b`. Given that `len(nums)` must be at least 2 initially, after this operation, `len(nums)` will be at least 1. The values of `k` and the precondition that `k` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first element that was removed from `nums`, `b` is the last element that was removed from `nums`, `len(nums)` is at least 1.**
