The code snippet `a -= x` modifies the value of `a` by subtracting `x` from it. Given that `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `a` is the first element that was removed from `nums`, the new value of `a` will be `a - x`.

If `x` is equal to `a`, then `a` will become `0`. If `x` is equal to `b`, then `a` will become `a - b` if `a > b`, but since `x` is the minimum, this situation does not arise. The values of `b`, `nums`, and the condition that `k` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is the last element that was removed from `nums`, `len(nums)` is at least 1, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**
