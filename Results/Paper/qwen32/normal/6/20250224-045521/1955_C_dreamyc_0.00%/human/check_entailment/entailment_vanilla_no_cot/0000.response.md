Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the number of attacks `k` is very large compared to the total durability of the ships. The program uses a deque to simulate the Kraken's attacks, but it does not efficiently handle scenarios where the Kraken can sink all ships in fewer than `k` attacks.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the total durability
    total_durability = sum(nums)
    
    # If k is greater than or equal to the total durability, all ships will sink
    if k >= total_durability:
        print(n)
        continue
    
    # Otherwise, simulate the attacks
    ans = 0
    nums = deque(nums)
    while k and nums:
        if k >= nums[0]:
            k -= nums.popleft()
            ans += 1
        else:
            nums[0] -= k
            k = 0
        
        if k and nums:
            if k >= nums[-1]:
                k -= nums.pop()
                ans += 1
            else:
                nums[-1] -= k
                k = 0
    
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Total Durability Check**: The program first calculates the total durability of all ships. If `k` is greater than or equal to this total, all ships will sink, and the program outputs `n`.

2. **Simulation of Attacks**: If `k` is less than the total durability, the program simulates the attacks using a deque. It alternates between attacking the first and last ships until `k` is exhausted or there are no ships left.

3. **Edge Cases**: This approach ensures that the program handles cases where `k` is very large efficiently and correctly simulates the attacks until all possible ships are sunk.
