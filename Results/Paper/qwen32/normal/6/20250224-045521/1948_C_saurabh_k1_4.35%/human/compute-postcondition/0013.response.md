Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is `t - 1` (This statement seems to imply that `t` is being decremented by 1, but it doesn't provide an initial value for `t`).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
- `b` is a list where each element is a character from the input string.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('No')
```

**Analysis:**
- The print statement `print('No')` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. 
- It simply prints the string `'No'`.

**Output:**
The print statement will output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
