The code snippet provided takes an input, converts each character of the input into a string, and stores these strings in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer

The variable `a` is newly introduced and is assigned a list of strings derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.**
