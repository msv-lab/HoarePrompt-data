Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all possible test cases. The logic in the program is overly simplistic and does not account for the robot's movement rules or the grid's structure.

The program checks only if the last arrow in the second row is pointing left (`<`). If it is, the program outputs "No"; otherwise, it outputs "Yes". However, this logic is insufficient to determine the robot's ability to reach the target cell (2, n) because the robot's movement depends on a sequence of moves and the direction of arrows in both rows.

Consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
>>><
><><
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation:
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It can move to (1, 2), (1, 3), or (2, 1).
- If it moves to (1, 2), it will follow the arrow to (1, 3).
- If it moves to (1, 3), it will follow the arrow to (1, 4).
- If it moves to (2, 1), it will follow the arrow to (2, 2).
- In all cases, the robot cannot reach (2, 4).

However, the program would output "YES" for this input because the last arrow in the second row (`<`) is not considered in the context of the entire path.

Another counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation:
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It can move to (2, 1).
- From (2, 1), it follows the arrow to (2, 2).
- From (2, 2), it follows the arrow to (2, 3).
- From (2, 3), it follows the arrow to (2, 4).

The program would output "NO" for this input because the last arrow in the second row (`<`) is considered, but the robot can actually reach (2, 4).

These examples demonstrate that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
