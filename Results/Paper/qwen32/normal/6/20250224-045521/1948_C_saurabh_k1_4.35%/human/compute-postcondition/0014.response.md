Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` is being updated to its current value minus 1. However, the initial value of `t` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value.
2. `n` is an input integer: This means `n` is a given integer value, but we don't know what it is from the provided information.
3. `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input: This means `a` is a list where each element is a single character from the input string.
4. `b` is a list where each element is a character from the input string: This is essentially the same as `a`, as both `a` and `b` are lists containing individual characters from the input string.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement is straightforward. It prints the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. There are no variables or conditions affecting the output of this print statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
