Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The program checks only the second last character of the second row and prints 'No' if it is a '<', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. This is an oversimplification and does not account for the complex movement rules and the need to explore possible paths through the grid. The robot can move in multiple ways and must follow the arrows correctly, which the current program does not handle.
