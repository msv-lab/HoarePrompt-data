The code assigns `b` to a new list created by mapping the `str` function over the input. Since the input is already a string, this essentially creates a list where each element is a single character from the input string.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list where each element is a character from the input string.**
