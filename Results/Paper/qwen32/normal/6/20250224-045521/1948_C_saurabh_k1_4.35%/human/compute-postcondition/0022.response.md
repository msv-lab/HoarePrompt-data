Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, `b` is a list where each element is a character from the new input string. The value of `b[n - 2]` is checked against the string `<`. Regardless of whether `b[n - 2]` equals `<` or not, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
