You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length `n` made up of '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last character of the second string is not '<'. If it is not, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all possible test cases. The logic in the program is overly simplistic and does not account for the robot's movement rules or the grid's structure.

The program checks only if the last arrow in the second row is pointing left (`<`). If it is, the program outputs "No"; otherwise, it outputs "Yes". However, this logic is insufficient to determine the robot's ability to reach the target cell (2, n) because the robot's movement depends on a sequence of moves and the direction of arrows in both rows.

Consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
>>><
><><
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation:
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It can move to (1, 2), (1, 3), or (2, 1).
- If it moves to (1, 2), it will follow the arrow to (1, 3).
- If it moves to (1, 3), it will follow the arrow to (1, 4).
- If it moves to (2, 1), it will follow the arrow to (2, 2).
- In all cases, the robot cannot reach (2, 4).

However, the program would output "YES" for this input because the last arrow in the second row (`<`) is not considered in the context of the entire path.

Another counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation:
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It can move to (2, 1).
- From (2, 1), it follows the arrow to (2, 2).
- From (2, 2), it follows the arrow to (2, 3).
- From (2, 3), it follows the arrow to (2, 4).

The program would output "NO" for this input because the last arrow in the second row (`<`) is considered, but the robot can actually reach (2, 4).

These examples demonstrate that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
