The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`. 

Since the loop head does not contain `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`, we cannot adjust these variables directly based on the loop head. However, we can infer that the loop will execute one more time if there are more iterations left to go, which means that the input value (which determines the total number of iterations) must be decremented by 1 after each iteration.

Given that the loop is about to start its next iteration, the state of `t` and `n` should reflect the fact that one iteration has just completed. Therefore, `t` and `n` should be decremented by 1.

However, since the loop head does not contain `t` or `n`, the state we need to describe only includes the implicit state of the loop counter, which is not directly visible in the loop head. The other variables (`a`, `b`, and the condition involving `b[n - 2]`) remain unchanged in terms of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input. If `b[n - 2]` is `<`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `<`. Otherwise, `b[n - 2]` is not equal to the string `'<'`**.

Since `t` and `n` are decremented by 1 after each iteration, for the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input. If `b[n - 2]` is `<`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `<`. Otherwise, `b[n - 2]` is not equal to the string `'<'`**.

To be precise about the state at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is `t - 1` (after the previous iteration completed), `n` is `n - 1` (which is the same as `t`), `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input. If `b[n - 2]` is `<`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `<`. Otherwise, `b[n - 2]` is not equal to the string `'<'`**.

Since the loop head does not directly reflect `t` and `n`, the state at the start of the next iteration, focusing only on the loop head, is implicitly adjusted by the loop counter:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input. If `b[n - 2]` is `<`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `<`. Otherwise, `b[n - 2]` is not equal to the string `'<'`**.

Given the constraints and the loop head, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input. If `b[n - 2]` is `<`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `<`. Otherwise, `b[n - 2]` is not equal to the string `'<'`**.

Since the loop head does not directly reflect `t` and `n`, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - 1`** (with the other variables remaining the same in terms of the loop head).

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input. If `b[n - 2]` is `<`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `<`. Otherwise, `b[n - 2]` is not equal to the string `'<'`**.
