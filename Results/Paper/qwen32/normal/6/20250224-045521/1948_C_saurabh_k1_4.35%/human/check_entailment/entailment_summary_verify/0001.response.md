Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct. The program provided does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description. The logic in the program is flawed and does not consider the entire path the robot can take, only focusing on the second last cell of the second row.

The function summary confirms that the program checks if the second-to-last character of the second string (b[n - 2]) is not '<'. If it is not, the program prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". This logic is incorrect because the robot's ability to reach (2, n) depends on the entire path and not just the direction of the arrow in the second last cell of the second row. The robot can potentially reach (2, n) from other cells, and the direction of the arrow in the second last cell of the second row does not fully determine the robot's ability to reach the target cell.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the robot's movement according to the rules provided and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1). The provided program does not perform this simulation and thus is incorrect.

Final: **False**
