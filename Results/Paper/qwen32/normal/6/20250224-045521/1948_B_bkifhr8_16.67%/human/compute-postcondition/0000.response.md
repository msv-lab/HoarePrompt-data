Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the length of lst, n, satisfies 2 <= n <= 50. `sorted_lst` is a list containing the same integers as `lst` but sorted in non-decreasing order. The function will be called multiple times (t times) with each call receiving a separate list lst as described, where 1 <= t <= 10^3.**

In natural language: The list `lst` remains unchanged and still contains integers between 0 and 99 with a length between 2 and 50. A new list `sorted_lst` is created, which contains the same integers as `lst` but sorted in non-decreasing order. The function can be called multiple times with different lists `lst` as described.
