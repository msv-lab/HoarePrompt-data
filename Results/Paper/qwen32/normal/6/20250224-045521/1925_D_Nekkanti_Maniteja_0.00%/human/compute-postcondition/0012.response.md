The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `2 * f`, `i` is 2, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers as read from the input.**
