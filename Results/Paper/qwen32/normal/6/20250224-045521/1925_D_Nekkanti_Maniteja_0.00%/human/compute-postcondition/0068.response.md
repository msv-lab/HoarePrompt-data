The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 2.

The variable `s` is updated within the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, `s` does not need to be modified here.

State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2**
