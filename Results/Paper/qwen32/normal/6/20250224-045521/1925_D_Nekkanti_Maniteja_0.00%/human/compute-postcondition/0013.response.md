The given code snippet assigns new values to `u`, `v`, and `f` by reading three integers from the input. The initial values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are overwritten by the new values provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `2 * f`, `i` is 2, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated to the new values provided in the input.
