Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is the number of nodes, `m` is the number of edges, and `k` is an additional integer parameter. It also accepts `m` lines of three integers each, representing edges and their associated values. The function returns a result based on the provided parameters and edge values for each test case.**
