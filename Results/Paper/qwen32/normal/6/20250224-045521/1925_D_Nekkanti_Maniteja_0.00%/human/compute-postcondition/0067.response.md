The value of `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. Given that `i` is 1 and `k` must be greater than 1, the other variables (`s`, `c`, `m`, and `a`) do not have specific values provided, so we express the new value of `s` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `s` is updated to `s + c * c * m + c * a`**.
