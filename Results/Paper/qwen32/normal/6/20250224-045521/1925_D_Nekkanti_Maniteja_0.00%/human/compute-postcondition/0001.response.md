The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state does not specify the values of `n`, `m`, or `k`, so these values are determined by the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input.**
