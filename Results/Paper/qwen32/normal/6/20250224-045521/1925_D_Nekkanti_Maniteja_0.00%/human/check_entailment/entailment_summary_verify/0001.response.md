### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program against the problem description and the given function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap
The task is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` randomly chosen pairs of children over multiple test cases. The expected value should be expressed in the form of \( \frac{p}{q} \), and the result should be \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) \).

#### Program Analysis
Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)  # Incorrect calculation of c
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a  # Incorrect sum calculation
        print(s % M)
```

#### Issues Identified

1. **Calculation of `c`:**
   - The variable `c` is intended to be the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs, which is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \). However, the code calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), which is incorrect. It should be the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), i.e., `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum `s` is being updated in a loop over `k` excursions, but the formula used for updating `s` is incorrect. The expected value calculation involves a more complex combinatorial approach.
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is not correct. The expected value for each pair of friends is calculated based on the probability of being chosen and the increasing friendship value over time. The correct approach involves summing the expected values over all possible pairs and considering the increasing friendship values.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic for the final result, but the intermediate calculations need to be corrected.

#### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Calculate the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
2. Calculate the expected value for each pair of friends, considering the increasing friendship values.
3. Sum the expected values for all pairs and compute the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the program, the provided code is incorrect.

**Final: False**

The original assessment accurately identified the issues in the program, and the reasoning provided is correct. Therefore, the final evaluation is:
