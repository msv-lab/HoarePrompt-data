Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `M` is a constant integer equal to 1000000007.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`.
- `s` is calculated as `s_0 + c * a * k + c^2 * m * (k * (k - 1)) // 2`.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop.
- `k` is greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s % M)
```

### Analysis:
- **`M`**: This is a constant, specifically `1000000007`.
- **`c`**: This is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`. This means `c` is an integer such that `(n * (n - 1) * c) % M == 1`.
- **`a`**: This is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop. The exact value of `a` depends on the input values of `f`.
- **`s`**: This is calculated using the formula `s_0 + c * a * k + c^2 * m * (k * (k - 1)) // 2`. Here, `s_0` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, so we'll assume it is a known constant or part of the input.
- **`s % M`**: The final output is the result of `s` modulo `M`.

### Output:
The output will be the value of `s` modulo `M`. Given the formula for `s` and the fact that `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, the final result will be a number between `0` and `M-1`.

Since the exact values of `s_0`, `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `s` modulo `M`.

Output: **s % M (where s is calculated as s_0 + c * a * k + c^2 * m * (k * (k - 1)) // 2, and c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo 1000000007)**
