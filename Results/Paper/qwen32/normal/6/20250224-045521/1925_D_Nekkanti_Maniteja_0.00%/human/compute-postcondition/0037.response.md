The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. This will overwrite the previous values of `u`, `v`, and `f` with the new values read from the input. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a + f + f`, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is `m - 1`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input.**
