To determine what will be printed by the `print(s % M)` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved in the expression `s % M`.

### Given Information:
- The initial state modifies `s` using the formula: `s = s + c^2 * m * (k-1) * k / 2 + c * a * k`
- The final print statement is `print(s % M)`

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Roles:**
   - `s`: The variable `s` is being updated using a formula that includes several other variables.
   - `c`: This variable is squared and used in the first term of the formula.
   - `m`: This variable is used in the first term of the formula.
   - `k`: This variable is used in both terms of the formula. It appears in a squared form and a linear form.
   - `a`: This variable is used in the second term of the formula.
   - `M`: This variable is used to take the modulus of the final value of `s`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - The first term of the formula is `c^2 * m * (k-1) * k / 2`. This term is a combination of `c`, `m`, and `k` and involves a quadratic component in `k`.
   - The second term of the formula is `c * a * k`. This term is a combination of `c`, `a`, and `k` and involves a linear component in `k`.
   - The updated value of `s` is the sum of its previous value and these two terms.

3. **Modulus Operation:**
   - The final value of `s` is then taken modulo `M` using `s % M`.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `s`, `c`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `M` are not specified, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s % M`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of `s % M`.

Output: **s % M (where s is the updated value of s using the formula s + c^2 * m * (k-1) * k / 2 + c * a * k, and M is the modulus value)**
