To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. This value is `t`, as per the description of the initial state.

Given the state before the loop starts is `t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4`, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute. Since `t` is the number of test cases, the loop will execute `t` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1.

Thus, the state `t` is already within the valid range for the loop to execute, and no adjustment is necessary for `t` to be greater than 0. The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of triples `(a_i, b_i, f_i)` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4**
