### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and the result should be calculated as \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs (`n * (n - 1) // 2`) and then attempts to compute the expected sum `s` over `k` excursions. However, the way the sum `s` is calculated is incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**:
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` is intended to be the modular inverse of the total number of pairs, but the `// 1` is redundant and should be `// 2`.

2. **Incorrect Update of `s`**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` incorrectly updates `s` with `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula does not correctly reflect the expected sum of friendship values.
   - The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting each pair and the incremental increase in friendship values due to previous selections.

3. **Handling of Friendship Values**:
   - The code sums up all initial friendship values in `a` but does not account for the incremental increase in friendship values correctly.
   - The expected sum should be calculated by considering the probability of selecting each pair and the cumulative increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - While the code uses modular arithmetic correctly for the inverse, the overall sum `s` should be calculated correctly first before taking the modulo.

#### Corrected Program:
The original assessment suggests a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        prob = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)  # Probability of selecting any pair
        initial_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            initial_sum = (initial_sum + f) % M
        
        # Expected sum of friendship values over k excursions
        expected_sum = (initial_sum * k) % M
        expected_sum = (expected_sum + (k * (k - 1) // 2) * prob * m) % M
        
        print(expected_sum)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the expected sum of friendship values by considering the initial sum of friendship values and the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions. It correctly handles the probability of selecting each pair and the incremental increase in friendship values.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the expected sum `s`. The original assessment correctly identifies this issue and provides a corrected version of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
