The given code snippet modifies the variable `s` by adding a specific expression to it. The expression involves the variables `c`, `i`, `m`, and `a`. Here is the calculation and the updated state of the variables:

The new value of `s` is calculated as:
\[ s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a \]
\[ s = s + c^2 \times i \times m + c \times a \]

All other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, and `i` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c^2 * i * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.
