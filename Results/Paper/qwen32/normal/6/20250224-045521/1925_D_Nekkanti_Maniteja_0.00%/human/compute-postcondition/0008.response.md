Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `f`, `i` is not adjusted, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers as read from the input.**

The value of `a` is now equal to the value of `f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
