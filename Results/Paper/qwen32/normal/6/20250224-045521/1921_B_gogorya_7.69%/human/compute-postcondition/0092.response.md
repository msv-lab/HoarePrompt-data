Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two strings `s` and `f` of equal length `n`, where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the comparison of the strings `s` and `f` for each test case.**
