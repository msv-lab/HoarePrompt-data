The code calculates the difference between `a1` and `a2` and assigns this value to `hd`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged except for the new variable `hd` which is the result of the subtraction.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`.**
