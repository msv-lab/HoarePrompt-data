The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or their values directly. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `res`, `hd`, `i`, `s1[i]`, and `s2[i]` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop will proceed to the next iteration, but since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, we only note that the loop continues.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are new input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `res` and `hd` are calculated based on the conditions provided; `i` is 2; `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are the characters at index 2 in `s1` and `s2` respectively; `hd` is decreased by 1. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
