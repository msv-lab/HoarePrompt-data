The `continue` statement in the given code snippet does not change the values of any variables; it merely skips the rest of the loop's code and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `hd`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; If `hd` > 0, then `hd` is now `hd - 1`; otherwise, `hd` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1; If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`, then `res` is incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1.**
