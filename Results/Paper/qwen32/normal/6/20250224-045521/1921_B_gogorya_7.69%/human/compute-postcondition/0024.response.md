Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `hd` > 0, then `hd` is now `hd - 1`; otherwise, `hd` remains 0. `i` is incremented by 1. If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`, then `res` is incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the variable `hd` is decreased by 1 if it was greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
