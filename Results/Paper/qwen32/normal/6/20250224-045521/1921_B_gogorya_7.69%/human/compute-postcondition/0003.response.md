The code snippet provided reads an input string and assigns it to the variable `s1`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `s1` as an input string, while `t` and `n` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is an input string**.
