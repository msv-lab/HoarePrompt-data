The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of changes required to make the number of '1's in `s1` equal to the number of '1's in `s2` by either changing '1's in `s1` to '0's or '0's in `s2` to '1's.
