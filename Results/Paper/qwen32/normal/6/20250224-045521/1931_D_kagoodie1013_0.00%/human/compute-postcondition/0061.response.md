The only variables in the loop head are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. These are the only states we can adjust for the next iteration of the loop. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more tuples in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have processed the first tuple `(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple in `test_cases`. The next tuple in the list is `(6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` should be set to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13]; `count` is 13; `mod_x_map` is {2: 4, 0: 1, 1: 1}; `mod_y_map` is {5: 1, 2: 5, 0: 1, 1: 1}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]**
