The code snippet `mod_x_key = num % x` attempts to assign the result of `num % x` to `mod_x_key`. However, the variables `num` and `x` are not defined in the initial state provided. Given the initial state, we do not have specific values for `num` and `x`, so we cannot compute the exact value of `mod_x_key`.

However, if we assume that `num` and `x` are supposed to be part of the tuple in `test_cases`, we can infer that `num` might be the second element of the tuple and `x` might be the third element of the tuple. If we use the first tuple in `test_cases` as an example, then `num` would be 3 and `x` would be 7.

Given `num = 3` and `x = 7`, the calculation would be `mod_x_key = 3 % 7`, which equals 3.

Therefore, the updated output state would be:

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` must be a list with at least one element; `mod_x` is 2; `mod_y` is 3; `mod_x_key` is 3.**
