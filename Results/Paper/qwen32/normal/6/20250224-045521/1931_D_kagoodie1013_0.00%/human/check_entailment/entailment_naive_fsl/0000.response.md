Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs as per the problem description. The issue lies in the way the `mod_x` and `mod_y` are calculated and used in the code.

In the problem, a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program uses the following logic:
- `mod_x = -num % x`
- `mod_y = num % y`

However, the correct logic should be:
- For the first condition \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), we need \((a_i \% x + a_j \% x) \% x == 0\). This means we should be looking for pairs of numbers that have the same remainder when divided by \(x\).
- For the second condition \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), we need \((a_i \% y - a_j \% y) \% y == 0\). This means we should be looking for pairs of numbers that have the same remainder when divided by \(y\).

The program incorrectly uses `-num % x` which does not align with the first condition. The correct approach would be to use `num % x` for both conditions and count pairs accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:
- Use `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y` for both conditions.
- Count pairs of numbers with the same `mod_x` and `mod_y` values.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect due to the misinterpretation of the modular arithmetic conditions.
