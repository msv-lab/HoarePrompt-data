The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect any other variables or the existing data structures. The `test_cases` list, which contains tuples representing the test cases, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) representing the elements of the array; `results` is an empty list.**
