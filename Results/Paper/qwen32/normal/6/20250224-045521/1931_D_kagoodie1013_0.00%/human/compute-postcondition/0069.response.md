The code snippet calculates `mod_x_key` as `num % x`. Given that `num` is the first element of `arr` and `x` is 4, we need to determine the value of `num` from the `test_cases` provided. The first element of `arr` in the first test case is 1. Therefore, `mod_x_key` will be `1 % 4`, which equals 1.

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13]; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is {}; `mod_y_map` is {}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is a list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`; `mod_x` is 3; `mod_y` is either 1 or 6; `mod_x_key` is 1.**
