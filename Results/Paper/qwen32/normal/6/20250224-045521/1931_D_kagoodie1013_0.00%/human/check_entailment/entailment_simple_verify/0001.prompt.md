You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
We need to find the number of beautiful pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in the array where:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it processes the array to count the beautiful pairs. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input is read in one go and split into a list of strings.
   - The number of test cases `t` is extracted from the first element.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are read, followed by the array `arr` of length `n`.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each test case, two dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are initialized to keep track of the remainders of the elements when divided by `x` and `y` respectively.
   - The program iterates over each element `num` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates the negative modulo of `num` with `x` (`mod_x = -num % x`) and the positive modulo of `num` with `y` (`mod_y = num % y`).
     - It then adds the counts of these remainders from the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to the `count` of beautiful pairs.
     - It updates the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the positive modulo of `num` with `x` and `y` respectively.

### Issues in the Program

The main issue in the program is the calculation of `mod_x` as `-num % x`. This is incorrect because:
- The condition for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) being beautiful requires \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by `x`. This translates to \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\). But the negative modulo should be handled correctly. Instead of `-num % x`, it should be `(x - num % x) % x` to ensure the remainder is in the range \([0, x-1]\).

### Correct Approach

The correct approach should be:
- Calculate `mod_x` as `(x - num % x) % x` to ensure the remainder is non-negative.
- Calculate `mod_y` as `num % y`.
- Use these values to update the count of beautiful pairs and the dictionaries.

### Conclusion

Given the incorrect calculation of `mod_x`, the program does not correctly count the beautiful pairs as per the problem's requirements.
