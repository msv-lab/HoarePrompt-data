The code calculates the modulus of `num` with `y` and assigns it to `mod_y`. From the initial state, `num` is not explicitly defined, but we can infer that `num` is the first element of the current tuple in `test_cases`, which is `6` for the first iteration. Given `y` is `8`, `mod_y` will be `6 % 8`, which equals `6`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `0`; `mod_x_map` is `{}`; `mod_y_map` is `{}`; `n` is `6`; `x` is `4`; `y` is `8`; `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`; `mod_x` is `0`; `mod_y` is `6`.**
