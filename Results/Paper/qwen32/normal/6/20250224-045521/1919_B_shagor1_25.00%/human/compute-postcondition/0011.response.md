The code snippet `neg += 1` increments the value of `neg` by 1. Given that `neg` is initially 2 if `i` is '-', and 1 if `i` is '+', after the increment, `neg` will be 3 if `i` is '-', and 2 if `i` is '+'. The other variables, `s` and `i`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `i` is the next character in `s` (i.e., `s[k+1]`), and `neg` is 3 if `i` is '-', otherwise `neg` is 2.**
