The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the string `s`. According to the loop, `i` will take the next character from `s` in each iteration. The state of `s` and its length `n` do not change; only `i` and `neg` can be adjusted based on the loop's progression.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next character in `s`, and `neg` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the previous `i` was '-' or not. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the subsequent character in `s`.

Let's denote the current character `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `s[k]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `s[k+1]`.

Since `neg` is dependent on the value of `i`, we need to adjust `neg` as well. If `s[k+1]` is '-', then `neg` should be set to 2; otherwise, `neg` remains 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `i` is the next character in `s` (i.e., `s[k+1]`), and `neg` is 2 if `i` is '-', otherwise `neg` is 1.**
