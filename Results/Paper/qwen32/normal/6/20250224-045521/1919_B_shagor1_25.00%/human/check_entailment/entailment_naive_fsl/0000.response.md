Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program seems to be attempting to count the number of '+' and '-' characters and then calculating a penalty based on that, but it does not follow the described process for splitting the array optimally.

Let's analyze the program with one of the provided examples:

**Example:**
```
Input:
5
1
+
5
-----
6
+-+-+-
10
--+++++++-
20
+---++++-+++++---++-
```

**Output:**
```
1
5
0
4
4
```

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
3. It counts the number of '-' characters.
4. It prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

This logic does not align with the problem's requirement to split the array optimally to minimize the penalty. The penalty calculation involves splitting the array into non-empty subarrays and summing up the penalties of these subarrays.

Let's consider a specific case where the program fails:

**Example Case:**
```
Input:
1
6
+-++++
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- One optimal way to split `a = [1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` is into `([1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1])`.
- The penalty for `([1, -1])` is `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`.
- The penalty for `([1, 1, 1, 1])` is `|1 + 1 + 1 + 1| * 4 = 4 * 4 = 4`.
- The total penalty is `0 + 4 = 4`.

However, the program would output `6 - 2 * 1 = 4`, which is not the minimum possible penalty for this case.

The program does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, hence it is incorrect.
