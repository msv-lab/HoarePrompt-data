The code snippet provided is:
```python
inx2 = last[i - 1]
```

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`.
- `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `1` if `a[2] < a[1]`.
- `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed.
- `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`.
- `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`.
- `inx2` is `last[1]`.
- If `inx` is less than `0`, the values of `inx` and `inx2` remain unchanged.
- `i` is 2.

The code snippet assigns the value of `last[i - 1]` to `inx2`. Since `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1. Therefore, `inx2` is updated to `last[1]`.

The output state will be the same as the initial state except for the updated value of `inx2`. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `1` if `a[2] < a[1]`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[1]`, `i` is 2.**
