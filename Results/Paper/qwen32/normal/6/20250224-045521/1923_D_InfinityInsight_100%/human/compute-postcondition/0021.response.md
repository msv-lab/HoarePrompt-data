The given Python code snippet appends a new element to the list `left`, where the new element is the sum of the last element of `left` and the current value of `i`. Since `i` is the next element in the list `a`, this means that `left` is being updated by adding the next slime size from `a` to the cumulative sum stored in `left`.

Given the initial state, `left` already has an additional element which is the sum of its last element and the current `i`. After the code execution, `left` will have one more element appended to it, which is the sum of the last element of `left` (before the new append) and the next `i` from `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes and must have at least one element; `left` has an additional element which is the sum of its last element and the current `i`, and another element which is the sum of the new last element of `left` and the next `i` from `a`. `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
