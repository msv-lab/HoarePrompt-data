Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `n >= 2`, `left` is a list containing a single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list containing three elements `[-1, i, i]`. Otherwise, `last` is `[-1, 2, 2]`.**
