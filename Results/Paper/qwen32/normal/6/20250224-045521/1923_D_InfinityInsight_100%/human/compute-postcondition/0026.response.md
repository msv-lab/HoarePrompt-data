Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, and `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed. Additionally, `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`.**
