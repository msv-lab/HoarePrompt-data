Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 4, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `3 - inx`. If `a[3] < a[2]`, then `ans[3]` is `1` and `last[3]` is `3`. Otherwise, `ans[3]` remains `-1` and `last[3]` is `last[1]`. `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[2]`, `i` is 3. The loop continues, and no variables are changed by the `continue` statement.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
