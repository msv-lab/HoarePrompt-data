The code snippet `ans[i] = i + 1 - inx` updates the value of `ans` at index `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `ans[2]` is being updated. The new value of `ans[2]` will be `2 + 1 - inx`, which simplifies to `3 - inx`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `3 - inx`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[1]`, `i` is 2.**
