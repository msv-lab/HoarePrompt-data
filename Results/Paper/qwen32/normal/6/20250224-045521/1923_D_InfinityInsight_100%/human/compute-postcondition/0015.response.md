The code snippet appends the last element of the `last` list to itself. Let's break down the possible scenarios for the `last` list based on the initial state.

1. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is initialized as `[-1, i, i]`. Appending the last element (`i`) to `last` results in `[-1, i, i, i]`.
2. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is initialized as `[-1, 2, 2]`. Appending the last element (`2`) to `last` results in `[-1, 2, 2, 2]`.

Since `i` is given as 3, the first scenario is more specific to the provided initial state. However, both scenarios are valid based on the conditional statement.

Given the initial state, the `last` list will be either `[-1, 3, 3, 3]` or `[-1, 2, 2, 2]` depending on the condition `a[i] != a[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `n >= 2`, `left` is a list containing a single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, `i` is 3, and `last` is either `[-1, 3, 3, 3]` or `[-1, 2, 2, 2]` depending on whether `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`.**
