Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes. It returns a list `ans` where each element at index `i` (for `i` from `1` to `n-1`) is `1` if the size of the slime at index `i` is less than the size of the slime at index `i-1`, or `i + 1 - inx` where `inx` is determined by a helper function `func_1` and the last index where a change in slime size was observed.**
