### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if the functions `func_1` and `func_2` collectively solve the problem as described.

#### Function `func_1`:

- **Purpose**: To find the position of a value `x` in the list `a` or the position where `x` would fit in a sorted list `a` if `x` is not present.
- **Behavior**: 
  - Returns `-1` if `x < 0`.
  - Uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the insertion point of `x` in `a`.
  - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns the index of `x` plus one.
  - If `x` is not found, it returns the index where `x` would be inserted.

#### Function `func_2`:

- **Purpose**: To calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.
- **Behavior**:
  - Initializes `left` and `last` lists to keep track of cumulative sums and the last index of a change in slime size, respectively.
  - Iterates through the slime sizes and updates the `ans` list:
    - If a slime is smaller than the previous one, it can be eaten immediately (`ans[i] = 1`).
    - Otherwise, it calculates the position where the current slime could be eaten based on the cumulative sums and the last change in size.
    - Uses `func_1` to determine the index from where the current slime could be eaten.
    - Updates the `ans` list with the minimum number of seconds required for the current slime to be eaten.

#### Main Program:

- **Purpose**: To process multiple test cases.
- **Behavior**:
  - For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten from both the left and right (by reversing the list and reusing `func_2`).
  - Combines the results from both directions to determine the final answer for each slime.
  - Prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

1. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the position of a value in a sorted list or the position where it would fit.
   - It handles edge cases such as negative values and values not present in the list.

2. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly identifies slimes that can be eaten immediately.
   - It calculates the cumulative sums and the last change in size to determine the position from where a slime could be eaten.
   - It uses `func_1` to find the appropriate index and updates the `ans` list accordingly.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program processes multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It considers both directions (left and right) to determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
   - It handles edge cases such as slimes that cannot be eaten.

### Conclusion:

The provided program, including functions `func_1` and `func_2`, correctly solves the problem by calculating the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, considering both directions.

**Correctness: True**
