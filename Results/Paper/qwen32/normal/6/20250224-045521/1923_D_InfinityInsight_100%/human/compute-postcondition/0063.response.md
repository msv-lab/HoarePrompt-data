The code snippet provided updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the value of `inx`. Let's break down the changes:

- `i` is initially 3.
- `ans[i]` is updated to `i + 1 - inx`.

Given the initial state, `ans[3]` was either `1` (if `a[3] < a[2]`) or `-1` (otherwise). After executing the code, `ans[3]` is updated to `3 + 1 - inx`, which simplifies to `4 - inx`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `last`, `x`, `inx`, `inx2`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 4, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `3 - inx`, and `ans[3]` is `4 - inx`. If `a[3] < a[2]`, then `ans[3]` is `1` and `last[3]` is `3`. Otherwise, `ans[3]` is `4 - inx` and `last[3]` is `last[1]`. `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[2]`, `i` is 3.**
