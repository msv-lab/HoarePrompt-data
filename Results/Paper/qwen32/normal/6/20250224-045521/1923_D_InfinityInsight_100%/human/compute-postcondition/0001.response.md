The code snippet provided initializes a new list `last` with a single element `-1`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, or `left`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `last` list with the value `[-1]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. `left` is a list containing a single element `0`. `last` is a list containing a single element `-1`.**
