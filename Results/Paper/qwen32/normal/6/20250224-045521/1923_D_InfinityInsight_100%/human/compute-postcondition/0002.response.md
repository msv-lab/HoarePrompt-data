The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `-1` repeated `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list `a`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, and `last`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. `left` is a list containing a single element `0`. `last` is a list containing a single element `-1`. `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times.**
