Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. The relationship between `a` and `b` remains unspecified as it does not affect the postcondition. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, the if block's specific actions are taken; otherwise, the else block's specific actions are taken.**
