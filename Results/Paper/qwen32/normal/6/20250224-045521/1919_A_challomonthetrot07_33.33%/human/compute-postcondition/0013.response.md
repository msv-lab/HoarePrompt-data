The `print('Bob')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `T`, `a`, or `b`. The string 'Bob' is explicitly provided in the print statement.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `a` is not equal to 1.
- `b` is not equal to 1.
- The current value of `a` is odd.

However, these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print('Bob')` statement. The print statement will simply output the string 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
