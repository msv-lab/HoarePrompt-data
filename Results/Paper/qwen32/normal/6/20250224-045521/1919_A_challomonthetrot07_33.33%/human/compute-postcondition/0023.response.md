Postcondition: **T must be greater than 0; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is not equal to 1, and `b` is not equal to 1; `a` is an even number. If `b` is an odd number, then `a` is an even number and `b` is an odd number. Otherwise, either `b` is an even number or `a` is an odd number; if `a` is greater than `b`, then the current value of `a` is greater than the current value of `b`. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**
