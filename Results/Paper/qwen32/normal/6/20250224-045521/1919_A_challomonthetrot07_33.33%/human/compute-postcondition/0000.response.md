The code snippet `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The variable `t` is not directly affected by the code snippet, but `T` is introduced and assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `T` is the input integer.**
