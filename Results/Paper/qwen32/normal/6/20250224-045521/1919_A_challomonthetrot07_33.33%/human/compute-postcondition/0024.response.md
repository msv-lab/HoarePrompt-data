Postcondition: **T must be greater than 0; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is not equal to 1, and `b` is not equal to 1. If `a` is odd, then `a` remains odd. If `a` is even, then `a` remains even. If `b` is odd, then `b` remains odd. If `b` is even, then `b` remains even. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, `a` is an even number and `b` is an odd number. If `a` is greater than `b` and `a` is even, then the current value of `a` is greater than the current value of `b`. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**
