Postcondition: **T must be greater than 0; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `b` is 1, the current value of `b` remains 1. Otherwise, if `b` is not 1, `b` retains its parity (odd or even). If `a` is odd, it remains odd, and if `a` is even, it remains even. If `a` is greater than `b` and `a` is even, then `a` is greater than `b`. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**
