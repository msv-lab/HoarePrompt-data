The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Alice'. The initial state provides information about the variables `a` and `b` and the condition that `T` must be greater than 0, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Output: **Alice**
