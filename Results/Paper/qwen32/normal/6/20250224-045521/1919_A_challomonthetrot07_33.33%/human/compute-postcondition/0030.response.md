Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the information and determine what will be printed.

### Initial State
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

### Output
The code will print the string `'Bob'` as it is specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **Bob**
