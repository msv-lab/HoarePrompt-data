The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state mentions that `T` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, the code snippet provided overwrites the values of `a` and `b` with new integers read from the input. The value of `T` remains unchanged, and `i` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1.**
