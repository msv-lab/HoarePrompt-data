Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. The relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged regardless of the condition.**

This postcondition summarizes that after the execution of the if-else block, the variable `T` remains greater than 0, `a` and `b` retain their values as integers read from the input, and `i` has been incremented by 1. Additionally, the relationship between `a` and `b` is not altered by the execution of the if-else block.
