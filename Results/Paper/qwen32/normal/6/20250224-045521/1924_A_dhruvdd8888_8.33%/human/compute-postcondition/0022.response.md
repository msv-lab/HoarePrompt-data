The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets read from the input.
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`.
- The behavior of `win`, `ans`, and `ps` is described but not directly relevant to the loop head.

To execute the next iteration of the loop, `i` should be the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`. Since we do not have the specific value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can denote the next character as `s[j]` where `j` is the current index of `i` in the string `s` plus one.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `i` is the next character in the string `s` (i.e., `s[j+1]` where `j` is the current index of `i` in `s`).**
