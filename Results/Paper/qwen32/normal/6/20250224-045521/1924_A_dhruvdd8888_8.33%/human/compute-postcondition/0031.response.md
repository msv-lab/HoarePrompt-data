Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers with 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the last character of each sequence of `k` distinct characters found in `s`; `ps` is the number of such sequences found in `s` and `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
