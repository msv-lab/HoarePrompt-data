The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about several variables and their properties, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables. It directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5.
   - `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers with specific constraints.
   - `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `win` is an empty set.
   - `ans` is a list that will contain the last character of each sequence of `k` distinct characters found in `s`.
   - `ps` is the number of such sequences found in `s` and is less than `n`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
   - This statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
