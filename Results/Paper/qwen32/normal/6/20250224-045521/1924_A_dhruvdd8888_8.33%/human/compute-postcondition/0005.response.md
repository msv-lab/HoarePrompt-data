The given code snippet initializes a variable `ps` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables provided in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 0.**
