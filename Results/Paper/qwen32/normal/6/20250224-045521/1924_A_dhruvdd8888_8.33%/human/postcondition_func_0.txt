The function reads input values `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s`. It checks if there are at least `n` sequences of `k` distinct characters in `s`. If so, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' and then constructs and prints a string of length `n` using the characters found in `s` and additional characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets to meet the requirement.
