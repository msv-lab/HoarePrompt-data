You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Purpose of the Program**: The program is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. If not, it should provide an example of such a string.

2. **Logic in the Program**:
   - The program reads the input and initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It then iterates over the string `s` and tries to collect a complete set of the first `k` alphabets in a window (`win`).
   - When a complete set is found, it adds the last character to the `ans` list and clears the window.
   - It checks if the length of `ans` is at least `n` to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences.
   - If `ans` is not long enough, it tries to construct a string of length `n` using characters from `us` and `ans`.

3. **Problems with the Logic**:
   - The program does not actually check if all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences. It only checks if it can find a sequence of length `n` where each character from the first `k` alphabets appears at least once. This is a very different condition.
   - The construction of the non-existing string is incorrect. It does not guarantee that the constructed string is one that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is greater than `k` (e.g., `n=3`, `k=2`), as it assumes that `ans` can be used to construct the required string, which is not always possible.

4. **Example**:
   - For the input `2 2 3 abb`, the program incorrectly outputs `YES` because it can find a sequence where each character from `a` and `b` appears at least once, but it does not check if all strings of length 2 (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`) are subsequences.
   - For the input `3 3 10 aabbccabab`, the program might output `NO` with an incorrect string because it does not correctly identify a string of length 3 that is not a subsequence.
