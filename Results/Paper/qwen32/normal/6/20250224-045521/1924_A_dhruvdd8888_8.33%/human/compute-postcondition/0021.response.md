Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`. If `i` is in `us`, then if `len(win) == k`, `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the current value of `i`, and `ps` is set to 1. Otherwise, `win` retains its original value with `i` added, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` remains 0. `ps` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` retain their original values.**
