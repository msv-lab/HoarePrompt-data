To determine the final state of the loop after all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the provided output states for the first three iterations. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5 (unchanged).
   - `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 (unchanged).
   - `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets (unchanged).
   - `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets (unchanged).
   - `win` is an empty set (initially and reset when `win` reaches length `k`).
   - `ans` is an empty list (initially and populated when `win` reaches length `k`).
   - `ps` is 0 (initially and incremented when `win` reaches length `k`).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If `i` is in `us`, `i` is added to `win`.
   - If `len(win) == k`, `i` is added to `ans`, `ps` is incremented by 1, and `win` is cleared.

3. **Final State**:
   - The loop will execute `m` times, once for each character in `s`.
   - Since `s` consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, each character will be in `us`.
   - The set `win` will accumulate characters until it reaches length `k`, at which point `win` will be cleared, and the process will repeat.
   - The list `ans` will contain the `k`-th character from each complete set of `k` characters in `s`.
   - The variable `ps` will count the number of complete sets of `k` characters found in `s`.

Given that `s` is a string of length `m` and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, the number of complete sets of `k` characters in `s` is `m // k`. Therefore, `ans` will contain `m // k` characters, and `ps` will be equal to `m // k`.

**Output State**: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the `k`-th character from each complete set of `k` characters in `s`; `ps` is equal to the number of complete sets of `k` characters in `s` (i.e., `m // k`).** 

In simpler terms, the final state is that `win` is empty, `ans` contains every `k`-th character from the string `s` where `s` is divided into complete sets of `k` characters, and `ps` is the count of these complete sets.
