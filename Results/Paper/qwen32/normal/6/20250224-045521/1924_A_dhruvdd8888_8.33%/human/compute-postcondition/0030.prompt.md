Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in us:
        win.add(i)
        if len(win) == k:
            ans.append(i)
            ps += 1
            win.clear()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `i` is in `us`. If `len(win) == k`, then `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the current value of `i`, and `ps` is set to 1; otherwise, `win` retains its original value, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`. If `i` is in `us`, then if `len(win) == k`, `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the current value of `i`, and `ps` is set to 1. Otherwise, `win` retains its original value with `i` added, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` remains 0. `ps` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `i` is the next character in the string `s` (i.e., `s[j+1]` where `j` is the current index of `i` in `s`). If `i` is in `us`, then `win` includes the character `i`. If `len(win) == k`, `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` includes the character `i`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `win` retains the character `i`. If `i` is not in `us`, no changes are made to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
