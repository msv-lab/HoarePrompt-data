### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - If they all occur, we print "YES".
   - If not, we print "NO" and provide a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the input values `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks for sequences of `k` distinct characters. If such a sequence is found, it adds the last character of this sequence to the list `ans` and clears the set `win`.
   - If the length of `ans` (which is supposed to contain the last characters of sequences of `k` distinct characters) is at least `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and attempts to construct a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic for checking if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence of `s` is incorrect. The code only checks for sequences of `k` distinct characters, which does not guarantee that all possible combinations of length `n` are present in `s`.
   - The construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence is also flawed. The code tries to append characters from `us` that are not in `win`, but this does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
