Postcondition: **`k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero; `ul` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than 0; if `re` initially equals `k`, then `res` includes all `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, plus the new element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1. Otherwise, `res` includes the new element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, and no further changes are made to `res` if `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 1; `i` is incremented by 1; `re` is incremented by 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1.**
