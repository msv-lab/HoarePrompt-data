To determine the output of the print statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the print statement itself.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **n must be greater than 0**: This tells us that `n` is a positive integer.
2. **l[a[i] - 1] equals 2**: This indicates that the element at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to 2.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```
This statement prints the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space, without moving to a new line due to the `end=' '` argument.

### Determining the Values:
- The exact value of `a[i]` is not explicitly given in the initial state, but we know that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2. This means that `a[i] - 1` is an index in the list `l` where the value is 2. Therefore, `a[i]` must be an integer such that `a[i] - 1` is a valid index in `l` and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

### Output Description:
Since we do not have the exact value of `a[i]`, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[i]`. The print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is an integer such that l[a[i] - 1] equals 2)**
