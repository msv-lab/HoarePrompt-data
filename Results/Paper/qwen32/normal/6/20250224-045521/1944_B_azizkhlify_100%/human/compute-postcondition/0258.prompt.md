Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the input, ul is 0, ur is 0, res is an empty list, a is the list of integers obtained from the input, l is a list where each element at index j is the count of how many times j+1 appears in the list a, r is a list of n zeros except that the element at index a[n] - 1 is n, the element at index a[n + 1] - 1 is n-1, ..., the element at index a[2*n-1] - 1 is 1, i is 2 * n - 1, re is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `ul` is either `k * 2` or 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is the list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the list `a` except `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros except that the element at index `a[n] - 1` is `n`, the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` is `n-1`, ..., the element at index `a[2*n-1] - 1` is 1, `i` is 2 * n - 1, `re` is 0. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, then `ul` remains `k * 2`. Otherwise, `ul` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `ul` is either `k * 2 + 2` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ul` remains `k * 2` or 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is the list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the list `a` except `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros except that the element at index `a[n] - 1` is `n`, the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` is `n-1`, ..., the element at index `a[2*n-1] - 1` is 1, `i` is 0, `re` is 0. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `ul` is either `k * 2 + 4` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ul` remains `k * 2` or 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is the list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the list `a` except `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `r` is a list of `n` zeros except that the element at index `a[n] - 1` is `n`, the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` is `n-1`, ..., the element at index `a[2*n-1] - 1` is 1, `i` is 1, `re` is 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
