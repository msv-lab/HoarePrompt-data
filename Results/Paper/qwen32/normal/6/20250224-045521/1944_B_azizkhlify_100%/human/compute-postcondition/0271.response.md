Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop breaks early or the sum of all increments of 2 that occurred during the iterations if the loop completes all `n` iterations.
- `ur` remains 0.
- `res` is a list containing `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` remains an empty list.
- `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- `i` is 1.
- `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` remains 0.
- `k` is not 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Value of `i`**: The initial state specifies that `i` is 1.
2. **Value of `a[i]`**: To determine what `a[i]` is, we need to know the list `a` and the value at index `i` (which is 1). Since the initial state does not provide the actual values of `a`, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

Given that `i` is 1, the print statement will output the value at index 1 of the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `a[1]` (since `i` is 1).

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the value at index 1 of the list `a`)**
