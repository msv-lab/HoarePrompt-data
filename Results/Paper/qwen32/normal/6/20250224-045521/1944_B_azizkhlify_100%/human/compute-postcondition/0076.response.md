To determine exactly what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given information and analyze the context:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain constant throughout.
- `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends.
- `ur` remains `0`.
- `res` contains more than one element.
- `i` is the second element in `res`.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space, without moving to a new line.

Given that `i` is explicitly described as the second element in the list `res`, we need to determine what value `i` holds. However, the exact contents of `res` are not provided, so we can only describe `i` in terms of its position in `res`.

Since `i` is the second element in `res`, it can be represented as `res[1]` (considering zero-based indexing in Python).

Therefore, the output will be the value of the second element in the list `res`, followed by a space.

Output: **res[1] (where res[1] is the second element in the list `res`)**
