Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

The initial state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is an integer obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`
- `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[j] - 1` incremented by 1
- `re` is 0
- `ul` is 0
- `ur` is 0
- `res` is an empty list
- `i` is `n + 2`

The code snippet is:
```python
r[a[i] - 1] += 1
```

Since `i` is `n + 2`, the code attempts to access `a[n + 1]`. However, the list `a` is only defined to have `n` elements (indices from 0 to n-1). Accessing `a[n + 1]` would result in an `IndexError` in Python because `n + 1` is out of bounds for the list `a`.

Given the problem constraints and the code provided, we must assume that the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `a` for the purpose of this exercise. If `i` were within bounds, the element at `r[a[i] - 1]` would be incremented by 1.

However, since `i` is `n + 2`, which is out of bounds, the code as written would not execute successfully. But for the sake of the exercise, let's assume `i` was a valid index within the bounds of `a` (for example, if `i` were `n - 1` or some other valid index).

Let's assume `i` were a valid index, say `i = n - 1` for the sake of the exercise. Then the code would be:
```python
r[a[n - 1] - 1] += 1
```
This would increment the element at index `a[n - 1] - 1` in the list `r` by 1.

Since `i` is actually `n + 2` and this would cause an error, we cannot proceed with the assumption that `i` is a valid index. Therefore, the code as written would not execute successfully.

However, if we hypothetically assume `i` were a valid index, the output state would be:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is an integer obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`
- `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[n - 1] - 1` incremented by 1
- `re` is 0
- `ul` is 0
- `ur` is 0
- `res` is an empty list
- `i` is `n + 2`

But since `i` is `n + 2` and this would cause an `IndexError`, the actual output state cannot be determined without modifying the code to ensure `i` is within bounds.

Given the problem constraints and the code provided, the output state cannot be determined as the code would raise an error. However, if we hypothetically assume `i` were a valid index, the output state would be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[n - 1] - 1` incremented by 1; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is `n + 2`.**

Since `i` is `n + 2` and this would cause an error, the actual output state is undefined due to the error.
