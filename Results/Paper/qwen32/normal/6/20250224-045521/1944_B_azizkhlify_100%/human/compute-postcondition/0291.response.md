The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `res`. If there are more elements in `res` after the current element `i`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element in `res`, which means the loop has already processed the first element. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least a third element in `res` so that `i` can take on this third value.

State: **`res` is a list containing at least three elements, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `i` is the third element in `res`**
