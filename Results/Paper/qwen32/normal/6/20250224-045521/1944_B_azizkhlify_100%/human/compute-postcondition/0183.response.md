To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **k**: Updated to `2 * k - ul` and remains non-zero.
2. **ul**: Remains unchanged.
3. **n**: Remains unchanged.
4. **i**: The next element in `res` after the current `i`.
5. **re**: The count of elements in `a` for which `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point of loop termination.
6. **res**: Contains all such elements `a[i]` and must have at least 1 element.
7. **a**: Remains unchanged.
8. **l**: Remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `i` followed by a space, as indicated by the `end=' '` argument.
- **`i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is the next element in `res` after the current `i`. This implies that `i` is an element from the list `res`.

### Output:
Since `i` is an element from the list `res` and the exact value of `i` is not provided, the most precise description we can give is that `i` is an element from `res`.

Output: **i (where i is an element from the list res)**
