To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `ul`: Either `k * 2` if the loop breaks early, or the sum of all increments of 2 during the iterations if the loop completes all `n` iterations.
   - `ur`: Remains 0.
   - `res`: Remains an empty list.
   - `a`, `l`, `r`: Remain unchanged (their specific values are not provided).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `re`: Remains 0.
   - `k`: Not 0.
   - `n`: Must be greater than 0.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]`: Is 1.

2. **Specific Focus:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(a[i], end=' ')`.
   - We need to determine the value of `a[i]` when `i` is 0.

### Analysis:

- Given that `i` is initialized to 0, the `print` statement will output `a[0]`.
- The initial state specifies that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. Since `i` is 0, this translates to `l[a[0] - 1]` being 1.
- This implies that `a[0] - 1` is an index into the list `l` where the value is 1.
- Therefore, `a[0]` must be an integer such that when you subtract 1 from it, it points to an index in `l` where the value is 1.

### Conclusion:

- The exact value of `a[0]` is not provided directly, but we know that `a[0]` is an integer that, when decremented by 1, points to an index in `l` where the value is 1.
- Since the problem statement specifies `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1, we can represent `a[0]` as `a[0] (where a[0] is an integer such that l[a[0] - 1] is 1)`.

### Final Output:

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is an integer such that l[a[0] - 1] is 1)**
