The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` modifies the list `r` by setting the element at the index `a[i] - 1` to 0. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `n + 1`, meaning `a[i]` refers to the element at index `n + 1` in the list `a`. The index in `r` that gets modified is `a[i] - 1`, which is `a[n + 1] - 1`.

Since the specific values of `a` and `r` are not provided, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables. The element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` in the list `r` is set to 0. The variables `n`, `ur`, and `ul` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `ur` is unchanged, `ul` is unchanged, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is 0.**
