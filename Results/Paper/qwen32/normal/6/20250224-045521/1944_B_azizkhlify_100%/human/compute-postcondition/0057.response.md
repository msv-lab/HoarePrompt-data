To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined and manipulated. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `k` is defined by the equation `k = 2 * k - ul`, but this seems to be a circular definition and likely needs clarification. For the purpose of this problem, let's assume `k` is some integer value derived from the context.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`, with elements set to `0` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was `2` during the loop.
   - `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
   - `re` is set to 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `re` remains 0.
   - `res` is a list containing the single element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `res` remains an empty list.
   - `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends or `k * 2` if it breaks early.
   - `ur` is initialized to 0.
   - `i` is the last value it took before the loop ended plus 1.

2. **Understanding the Loop and Variables:**
   - The loop iterates over the list `a` and updates the lists `l` and `r` based on the counts of elements.
   - If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `re` is set to 1 and `res` is set to `[a[i]]`.
   - `ul` counts how many times the value `2` appears in `l`.
   - `ur` is not updated in the description, so it remains 0.
   - `i` is the index after the loop ends.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The print statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` prints the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
   - Since `i` is the last value it took before the loop ended plus 1, it points to the next element after the loop’s last iteration.

Given the information, the precise value of `a[i]` cannot be determined without the exact list `a` and the specific loop conditions. However, we can describe what `a[i]` represents.

Output: **a[i] (where i is the last value it took before the loop ended plus 1)**
