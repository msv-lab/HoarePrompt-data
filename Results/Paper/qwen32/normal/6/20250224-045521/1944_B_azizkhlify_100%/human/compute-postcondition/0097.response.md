The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, provided that it is still within the range.

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will start with `i` equal to `n` and go up to `2 * n - 1`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`**
