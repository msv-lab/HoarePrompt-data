To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`n` is greater than 0**: This tells us that `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.
2. **`i` is incremented by 1**: This implies that `i` was initially some value, and then 1 was added to it. However, the initial value of `i` is not provided.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```
This statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space (since `end=' '`).

### Missing Information:
1. **The list `a`**: The contents of the list `a` are not specified.
2. **The initial value of `i`**: We only know that `i` has been incremented by 1, but we do not know its initial value.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `a` and the initial value of `i`, we can only provide a general description of the output.

### Output Description:
- The `print` statement will output the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space.
- Since the exact contents of `a` and the value of `i` (before incrementing) are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical or string values that will be printed.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where `i` is the incremented index and `a` is the list containing the elements to be printed)**
