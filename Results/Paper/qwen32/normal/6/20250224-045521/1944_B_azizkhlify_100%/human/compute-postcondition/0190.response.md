To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

**Initial State:**
1. `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
2. `r` is a list such that the element at index `a[i] - 1` is equal to 2.

**Code Snippet:**
```
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know that `r` is defined based on the values in list `a`. Specifically, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2. However, the code snippet does not involve the list `r` directly. Instead, it prints the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` or `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. `a` is a list, and `i` is an index into this list.
2. The value of `a[i]` is printed twice.
3. The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space instead of a newline.

**Output Description:**
The code will print the value at index `i` of the list `a`, followed by the same value again, and then a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
