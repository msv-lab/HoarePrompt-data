The value of `ur` is incremented by 2. The values of `n`, `i`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is increased by 2**.
