The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` modifies the list `r` by setting the element at index `a[i] - 1` to 0. Given the initial state, `i` is `n + 1`, so the index being modified is `a[n + 1] - 1`. This operation does not change the values of `n` or `i`, but it does change the value at a specific index in the list `r`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1`, and the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` in list `r` is 0.**
