Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least `i + 2` elements, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers where the first element is `prod // a[0]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a` before the modification, `i` is `i + 1`, `sumo` is `bets * (prod // a[0])`**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
