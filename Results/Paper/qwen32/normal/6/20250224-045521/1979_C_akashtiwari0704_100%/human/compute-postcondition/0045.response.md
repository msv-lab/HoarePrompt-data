The code modifies the variable `g` by multiplying it with `l[i]` and then dividing the result by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are modified to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` modified elements of `a`, `i` is 1**.
