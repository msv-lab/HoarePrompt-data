Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers where the first element is `prod // a[0]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a` before the modification, `i` is either 0 or `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is `bets * (prod // a[0])`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `bets` has been updated to the integer value provided by the user input. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
