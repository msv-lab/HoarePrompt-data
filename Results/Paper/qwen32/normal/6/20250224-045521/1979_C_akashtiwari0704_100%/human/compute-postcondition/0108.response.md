Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where each element a[i] is `prod // a[i]` for i in range(bets), `prod` is the LCM of all elements in the new `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the new `a`. Additionally, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is an empty string.**

In simple terms, the variable `ans` has been initialized as an empty string, while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
