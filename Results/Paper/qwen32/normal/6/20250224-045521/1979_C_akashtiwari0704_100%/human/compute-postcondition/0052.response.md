Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are modified to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` modified elements of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `l` minus one.**

In simpler terms, the variable `bets` has been assigned the value of an integer input by the user. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
