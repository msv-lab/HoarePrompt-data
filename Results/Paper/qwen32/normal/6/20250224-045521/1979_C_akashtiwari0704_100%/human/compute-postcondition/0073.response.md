The code snippet appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the new value of `ans` will be the concatenation of its current value and `str(a[1]) + ' '`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers where the first element is `prod // a[0]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a` before the modification, `sumo` is `bets * (prod // a[0])`, `i` is 1, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is `'str(prod // a[0]) ' + str(a[1]) + ' '`**
