The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the previous values of `a` are replaced by the new list of integers read from the input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `T` is 1
- `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`
- `l` is a list with at least one element
- `bets` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are modified to `prod // a[i]`
- `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`
- `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` modified elements of `a`
- `i` is equal to the length of `l` minus one

After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` modified elements of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `l` minus one.**
