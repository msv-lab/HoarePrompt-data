The only variable in the loop head is `T` and the range it iterates over is `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, the loop will definitely execute at least once as long as `t` is within this range. 

Since the loop variable `T` will start from 0 (the default behavior of `range` in Python), we do not need to adjust its value before the loop starts. However, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value within the specified range to guarantee that the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0**
