To determine the new state after the given code snippet is executed, we need to focus on the impact of the single line of code on the variables. The line of code modifies the variable `g` based on the current values of `g`, `l[i]`, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `T` is 2
- `g` is 1
- `l` is a list with at least one element
- `bets` is an input integer
- `a` is a new list of integers where the first element is `prod // a[0]`
- `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a` before the modification
- `i` is either 0 or `bets - 1`
- `sumo` is `bets * (prod // a[0])`
- If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `i` is not modified.
- If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `bets - 1`, and `ans` is a string with `bets` number of space-separated integers from `a`.

The line of code is:
```
g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
```

Since `g` is initially 1, the expression simplifies to:
```
g = 1 * l[i] // gcd(1, l[i])
```
The greatest common divisor of 1 and any number is 1, so the expression further simplifies to:
```
g = l[i]
```

Thus, the value of `g` is updated to `l[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is `l[i]`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers where the first element is `prod // a[0]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a` before the modification, `i` is either 0 or `bets - 1`, `sumo` is `bets * (prod // a[0])`.**
