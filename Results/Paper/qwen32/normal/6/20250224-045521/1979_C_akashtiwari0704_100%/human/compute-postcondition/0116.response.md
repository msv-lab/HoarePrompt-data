To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- The string representations of all elements in the list `a`, each followed by a space.

This description implies that there is a list `a` and its elements are being converted to their string representations, with a space appended after each element. However, the variable `ans` is not directly mentioned in the initial state. We need to infer its value based on the information provided.

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: This list contains elements that could be of any type (integers, strings, etc.).
2. **String Representations**: Each element of `a` is converted to its string representation.
3. **Spaces**: A space is added after each string representation of the elements in `a`.

Given the information, it's reasonable to infer that `ans` might be a string that concatenates these string representations with spaces. However, since `ans` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot be certain of its value unless it is constructed from the list `a` in a specific way.

Since the exact construction of `ans` is not provided, we can only describe the output based on the typical understanding of such a scenario.

### Conclusion:
If `ans` is indeed constructed by concatenating the string representations of the elements in `a` with spaces, then the print statement will output that concatenated string.

### Output:
Assuming `ans` is constructed as described, the output will be a single string containing the string representations of all elements in `a`, each followed by a space.

Output: **string representation of a[0] + ' ' + string representation of a[1] + ' ' + ... + string representation of a[n-1] + ' ' (where a is the list and n is the number of elements in a)**
