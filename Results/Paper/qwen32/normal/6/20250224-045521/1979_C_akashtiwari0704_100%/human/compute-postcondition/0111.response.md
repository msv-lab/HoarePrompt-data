The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `bets` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. 

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. The value of `bets` should remain the same as long as it is greater than `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`bets` must be greater than `i + 1`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we do not have the specific value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the state in terms of the incremented `i`.

State: **`bets` must be greater than `i + 1`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is incremented by 1**.
