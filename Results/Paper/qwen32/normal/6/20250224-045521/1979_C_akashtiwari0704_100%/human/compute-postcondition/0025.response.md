The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the value of `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `sumo` was initially `sumo` and `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, the new value of `sumo` becomes `sumo + int(a[i])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 1, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is `sumo` + `int(a[i])`**.
