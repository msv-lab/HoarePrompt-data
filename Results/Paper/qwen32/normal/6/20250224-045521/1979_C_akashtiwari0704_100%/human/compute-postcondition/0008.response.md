The code updates the value of `g` based on the current value of `g` and the element at index `i` in the list `l`. The new value of `g` is calculated as `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. The values of `t`, `T`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 2.**
