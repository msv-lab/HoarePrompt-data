The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements of the list `a` that are at even indices. The elements at odd indices remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`.

After executing the code snippet, the list `a` will have its elements at even indices reversed, while the elements at odd indices will remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5; `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with elements at even indices reversed.**
