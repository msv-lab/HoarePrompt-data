Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, creates a list of integers from 1 to `n`, reverses the elements at even indices, and prints the modified list. This process is repeated for `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer specified at the beginning, and each `n` for the test cases must satisfy 3 <= n <= 10^5 with the total sum of all `n` not exceeding 10^5.**
