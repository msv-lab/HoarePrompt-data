To determine the output of the `print(a)` statement, we need to understand how the list `a` is constructed based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
3. `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with elements at even indices reversed.

### Construction of List `a`:
- Start with a list of integers from 1 to `n`.
- Reverse the elements at even indices (considering 0-based indexing).

### Example Construction:
Let's consider an example to understand the construction better.
- Suppose `n = 6`.
- The initial list from 1 to 6 is: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- Elements at even indices (0, 2, 4) are: `[1, 3, 5]`.
- Reverse these elements: `[5, 3, 1]`.
- Place them back at their respective even indices: `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.

### General Construction:
- For a general `n`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
- Elements at even indices are `[1, 3, 5, ..., floor(n/2)*2 - 1]` if `n` is odd or `[1, 3, 5, ..., n-1]` if `n` is even.
- Reverse these elements and place them back at their respective even indices.

### Output Description:
The list `a` will be a list of integers from 1 to `n` where the elements at even indices are reversed.

### Final Output:
Given the construction process, the output will be a list where the elements at even indices are reversed compared to the original list from 1 to `n`.

Output: **a (where a is a list of integers from 1 to n with elements at even indices reversed)**
