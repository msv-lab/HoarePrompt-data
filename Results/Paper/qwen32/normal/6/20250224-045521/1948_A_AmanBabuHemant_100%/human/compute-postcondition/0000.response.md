Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be an integer input by the user, while the condition for `n` remains unchanged as it pertains to future inputs within the loop or subsequent code that will handle the test cases.
