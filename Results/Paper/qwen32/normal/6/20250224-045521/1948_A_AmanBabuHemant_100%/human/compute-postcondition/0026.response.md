The value of `s` is assigned the string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 2 <= 49; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 2 <= 49; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.**
