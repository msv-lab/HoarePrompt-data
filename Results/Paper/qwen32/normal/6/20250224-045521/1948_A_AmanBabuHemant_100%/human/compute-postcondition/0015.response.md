The code provided only reassigns the value of `n` based on the input, without affecting any other variables directly. Therefore, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `s` will only be defined if `n` is even and after the subsequent code that defines `s` is executed (which is not part of the provided snippet).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 49; `n` is an input integer.**
