The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the loop in terms of the variables provided. The loop will execute `t` times, and the state at the start of each iteration only needs to reflect the decrement in the number of remaining iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50
- `n` is an input integer
- If `n` is odd, no additional changes are made to the variables.
- If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is less than 200 or 200 or more, depending on the value of `n`.

Since the loop is `for _ in range(t)`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`. At the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 49; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no additional changes are made to the variables. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it remains less than 200; otherwise, the length of `s` is 200 or more.**
