Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it only considers even values of `n` and outputs a string of the form `'AAB' * (n // 2)`. This approach works for even values of `n`, but it fails for odd values of `n` because the string cannot have exactly an odd number of special characters with the given pattern.

However, it is possible to construct a string with an odd number of special characters. For example, for `n = 1`, the string "MM" is valid because 'M' is a special character (it has no neighbors, but the condition is that it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, and since it has no neighbors, it trivially satisfies the condition of being a special character).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('MM')
        elif n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This version handles the special case where `n = 1` and outputs "YES" followed by "MM". For odd values of `n` greater than 1, it still outputs "NO" because it's not possible to construct such a string with an odd number of special characters using the given pattern.
