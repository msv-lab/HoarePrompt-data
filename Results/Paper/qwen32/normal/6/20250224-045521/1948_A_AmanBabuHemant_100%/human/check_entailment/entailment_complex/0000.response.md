### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a string with exactly `n` special characters where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The solution provided in the annotated program addresses this problem with the following logic:

1. **Odd `n` Case**: If `n` is odd, the program correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters will always come in pairs (one character in the pair is equal to the one on its left, and the other is equal to the one on its right).

2. **Even `n` Case**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating the substring "AAB" `n // 2` times. This string construction ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters. Specifically, in each "AAB" segment, the second 'A' is a special character (it is equal to the 'A' on its left and different from the 'B' on its right), and the 'B' is also a special character (it is equal to the 'A' on its left and different from the 'A' on its right). Therefore, each "AAB" segment contributes exactly 2 special characters.

3. **Length Constraint**: The program also checks if the length of the constructed string is less than 200. Given that "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times results in a string of length `3 * (n // 2)`, the maximum length occurs when `n` is 50, which results in a string of length `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`. Since 75 is less than 200, the length constraint is always satisfied for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both the odd and even cases for `n` and ensures that the constructed string meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
