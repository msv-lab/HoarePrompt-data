In the provided task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1 because the loop will not execute if `t` is 0. However, since the problem statement specifies that 1 <= `t` <= 50, we already know that `t` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

The loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is a temporary variable used only within the loop and does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50**
