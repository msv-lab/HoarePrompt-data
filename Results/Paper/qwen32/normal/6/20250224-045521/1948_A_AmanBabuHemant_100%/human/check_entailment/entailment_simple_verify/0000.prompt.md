You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is 0 and no further test cases are processed. For each of the initial `t` test cases, the output is either 'NO' if `n` is odd, or 'YES' followed by the string `s` (which is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times) if `n` is even and the length of `s` is less than 200. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, the output is 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that a string can only be constructed if `n` is even. This is not true according to the problem description. A valid string can be constructed for any positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

Let's consider the cases:
- For `n = 1`, a valid string could be "A" or "B" because the single character is trivially special.
- For `n = 2`, a valid string could be "AB" or "BA" because both characters are special.
- For `n = 3`, a valid string could be "ABA" or "BAB".
- For `n = 4`, a valid string could be "AABB" or "ABAB".

The program only generates a string when `n` is even and uses the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that every character except the last one in each "AAB" group is special, and the last character in the last group is special if `n` is a multiple of 3. However, this pattern does not cover all possible values of `n`, particularly when `n` is odd.

For example, when `n = 1`:
- The program will output "NO" because `n` is odd.
- However, "A" is a valid string with 1 special character.

When `n = 3`:
- The program will output "NO" because `n` is odd.
- However, "ABA" is a valid string with 3 special characters.

Thus, the program fails to handle cases where `n` is odd, leading to incorrect outputs for those test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
