### Reasoning:

1. **Special Character Definition**:
   - A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in the string "AAABAACC", the special characters are at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - If `n` is odd, the program outputs "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - If `n` is even, the program generates a string `s` by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters:
     - In the pattern "AAB", 'A' at positions 1 and 3 are special because they are equal to exactly one neighbor ('B' for position 1, and 'A' for position 3).
     - Thus, repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times will create `n` special characters.
   - The program checks if the length of the generated string `s` is less than 200. If it is, the program outputs "YES" followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

3. **Validation**:
   - The logic correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by outputting "NO".
   - For even `n`, the generated string `s` will always have a length of `3 * (n // 2)`, which is at most `3 * (50 // 2) = 75` (since `n` is at most 50). Therefore, the length of `s` will always be less than 200, and the program will correctly output "YES" followed by the string `s`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a suitable string can be built for each test case and generates the required string when possible.

**Correctness: True**
