Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `q` is greater than `i + 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a < b < c`, the condition is evaluated but the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` is evaluated, but the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition is true or false.**
