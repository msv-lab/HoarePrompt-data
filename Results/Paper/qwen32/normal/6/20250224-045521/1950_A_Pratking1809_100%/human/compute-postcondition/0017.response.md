Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and `q` is greater than 0. If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds. Otherwise, the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` is such that either `a < b > c`, or it is not the case that `a < b > c`. In all cases, `i` is incremented by 1.**
