Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\).
- `q` is greater than 0.
- There is a condition that checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition holds, then the condition `a < b < c` is true. Otherwise, the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` is such that either `a < b` and `b > c`, or it is not the case that `a < b > c`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 based on some condition, but this does not affect the print statement directly.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NONE'`. This string is hardcoded and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, or `i`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
