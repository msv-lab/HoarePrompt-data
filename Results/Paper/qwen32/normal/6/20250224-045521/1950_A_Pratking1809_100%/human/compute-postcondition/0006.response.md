Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `q` is greater than 0, and it is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. The current relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` is that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.**
