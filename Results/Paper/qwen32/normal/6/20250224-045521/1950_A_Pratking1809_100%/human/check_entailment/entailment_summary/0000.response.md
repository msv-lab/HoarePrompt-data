Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the three given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. 

The program starts by reading the number of test cases `q`. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the following:
- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
- If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

This logic matches exactly with the problem's requirements. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
