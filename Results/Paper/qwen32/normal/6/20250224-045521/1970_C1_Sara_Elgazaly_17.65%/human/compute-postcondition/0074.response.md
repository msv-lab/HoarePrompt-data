The code snippet `s = not s` inverts the boolean value of `s`. Given that the initial state specifies `s` is False, after executing the code, `s` will be True. The other variables (`lst[x]`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`lst[x]` is empty, `x` is the last node that was fully explored, `y` is the last element that was popped from `lst[x]` in the final iteration, and `s` is True.**
