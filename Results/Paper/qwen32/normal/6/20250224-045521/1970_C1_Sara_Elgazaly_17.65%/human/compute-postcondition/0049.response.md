The code snippet provided is `x = y`. This means the value of `x` is being updated to be equal to the value of `y`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5
- `t` is 1
- The tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves
- The last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round
- `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[x]` has at least one element less than before
- `x` is equal to the previous value of `y`
- `y` is the element that was just popped from `lst[x]`
- `s` is False

The only change in the output state is that `x` is now equal to `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[x]` has at least one element less than before, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the element that was just popped from `lst[x]`, and `s` is False.**
