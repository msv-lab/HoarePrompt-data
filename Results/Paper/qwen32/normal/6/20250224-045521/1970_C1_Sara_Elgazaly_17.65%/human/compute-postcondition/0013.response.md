The code snippet `lst[b].append(a)` modifies the list associated with the key `b` in the `defaultdict` `lst`. Initially, `lst[b]` includes `a` three times. After appending `a` to `lst[b]`, `lst[b]` will now include `a` four times.

Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is 1; the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves; the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round; `x` is 2; `y` are the two integers read from the input; `a` and `b` are the two new integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[a]` includes `b` three times and `lst[b]` includes `a` four times.**
