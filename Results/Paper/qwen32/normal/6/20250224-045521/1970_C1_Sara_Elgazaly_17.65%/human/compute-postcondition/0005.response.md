The code snippet provided appends the value of `a` to the list associated with the key `b` in the `defaultdict` `lst`. 

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is 2, `y` are the two integers read from the input, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[a]` includes `b`.

Impact of the code: The value of `a` is appended to the list associated with the key `b` in the `defaultdict` `lst`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is 2, `y` are the two integers read from the input, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[a]` includes `b` and `lst[b]` includes `a`.**

In simple terms: The output state remains the same except that `lst[b]` now includes `a` in addition to whatever it previously included.
