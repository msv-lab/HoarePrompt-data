The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 and still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed, `n` is the integer input by the user, and `res` is the count of zeros in the list `a`.**
