The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the loop will definitely execute at least once. The list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and the values of `n` are not directly related to the loop's execution; they are used within the loop body, which is omitted here.

Thus, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the provided loop head. The state before the loop starts already ensures that the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
