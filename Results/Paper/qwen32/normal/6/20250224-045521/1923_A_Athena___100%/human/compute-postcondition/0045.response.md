The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the initial state specifies that `a` has one less element than it originally had plus an additional element `0`, the `pop()` operation will remove this last element `0`, restoring `a` to its original state minus one element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a list with one less element than it originally had, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is 0.**
