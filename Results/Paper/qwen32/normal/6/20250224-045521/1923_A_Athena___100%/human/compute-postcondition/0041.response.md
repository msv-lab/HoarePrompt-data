Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a list with all leading zeros removed, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that `t` remains unchanged, `a` no longer starts with any zeros, `n` remains the same as it was initially, and `res` remains 0.
