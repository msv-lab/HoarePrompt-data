Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the number of elements left in `a` after all leading `0`s are removed and all trailing `0`s are removed; `a` is a list of integers with all leading `0`s and trailing `0`s removed; `res` is 0.**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing, the list `a` will have had all trailing zeros removed, and `n` will reflect the number of elements remaining in `a` after these removals. The value of `t` and `res` will remain unchanged.
