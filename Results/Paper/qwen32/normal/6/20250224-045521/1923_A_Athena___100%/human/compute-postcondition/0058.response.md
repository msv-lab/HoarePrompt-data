Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a list with at least one element, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is 1 if the current element `a[i]` is 0; otherwise, `res` remains 0, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` is 0, `res` is set to 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1.**
