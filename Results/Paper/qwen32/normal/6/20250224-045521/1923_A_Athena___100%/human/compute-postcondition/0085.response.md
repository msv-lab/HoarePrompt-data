Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is `res + 1` (previously 1 if the current element `a[i]` was 0; otherwise, `res` was 0), `i` is `i + 1`**

In simpler terms, `res` has been incremented by 1, and `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
