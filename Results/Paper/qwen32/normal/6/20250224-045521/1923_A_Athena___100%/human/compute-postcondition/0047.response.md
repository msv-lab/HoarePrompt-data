The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a` must have at least one element and that element must be 0, after executing `a.pop()`, the list `a` will be empty.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `res`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is an empty list, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is an empty list, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is 0.**
