The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the last element of `a` is 0, this element will be removed. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and the last element removed, `n` is the integer input by the user, and `res` is 0.**
