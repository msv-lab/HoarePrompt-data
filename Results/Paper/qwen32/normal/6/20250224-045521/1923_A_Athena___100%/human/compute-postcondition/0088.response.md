The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of the variable `res` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`.**
