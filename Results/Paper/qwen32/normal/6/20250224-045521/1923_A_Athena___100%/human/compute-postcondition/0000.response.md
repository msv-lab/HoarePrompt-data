The code snippet provided only reads the integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `t` is assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. In each test case, there is at least one a_i that equals 1.**
