The code snippet appends the string 'aa' concatenated with the character at the position `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string to the `word` variable. Given that `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the character at position `n - 3` will be `alphabet[n - 3]`. Since `n` is an input integer, the specific character appended will depend on the value of `n`.

The variable `i` is mentioned to be incremented by 1 in the initial state, but the provided code snippet does not affect `i`. Therefore, `i` remains incremented by 1.

The variable `word` was initially an empty string and is now 'aa' plus the character at position `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.

The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1, `word` is 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`.**
