The code snippet `word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` appends the string `'aa'` concatenated with the character at the index `n - 3` of the `alphabet` string to the `word` variable.

Given that `alphabet` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, the character at index `n - 3` will be the `n - 2`-th letter of the alphabet (since indexing starts at 0).

For example, if `n` is 3, `alphabet[n - 3]` will be `'a'`. If `n` is 4, `alphabet[n - 3]` will be `'b'`, and so on.

Since `word` was initially an empty string, after executing the code, `word` will be `'aa'` followed by the `n - 2`-th letter of the alphabet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 26, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `word` is the string 'aa' + the (n - 2)-th letter of the alphabet**.
