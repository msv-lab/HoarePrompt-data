The code snippet `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` modifies the `word` variable by appending a new string to it. The new string is constructed by concatenating the character 'a', the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, and the character 'z'. 

Given that `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the character at index `n - 28` will be the character corresponding to the position `n - 28` in the alphabet. Since `n` is an input integer, the specific character will depend on the value of `n`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `i` remain unchanged by this code snippet. Only `word` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'**.
