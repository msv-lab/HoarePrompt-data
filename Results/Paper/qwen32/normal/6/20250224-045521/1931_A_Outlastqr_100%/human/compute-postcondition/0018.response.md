The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop control variable. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has not been explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. Since the loop body is omitted, we only need to adjust `i` by incrementing it by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Given that the other variables (`t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `word`) are not part of the loop head, we do not need to adjust their states.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1**
