The code snippet modifies the `word` variable by appending a substring from the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz'. Specifically, it appends the character at the index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` string to `word`, and then appends 'zz'. 

Given that `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the index `n - 53` must be within the bounds of the string `alphabet` for the code to work correctly. Since `alphabet` has 26 characters, `n - 53` should be in the range 0 to 25. This implies `n` should be in the range 53 to 78.

The `i` variable is described as `i + 1`, but it is not used in the provided code snippet, so its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 1`, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`**.
