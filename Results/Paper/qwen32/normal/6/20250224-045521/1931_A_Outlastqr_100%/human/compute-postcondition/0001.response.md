The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` statement. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. This integer determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

Given the state before the loop starts, we have:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer n such that 3 <= n <= 78.
- `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.

However, the loop head only depends on the input provided to `range()`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input to `range()` is a positive integer. Since the loop is driven by the input, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the input will be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer n such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; the input to `range()` must be a positive integer**.

Since the loop is driven by the input, we can specify that the input should be a positive integer, for example, `n` from one of the test cases. For the loop to execute at least once, the input should be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer n such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; the input to `range()` is a positive integer, for example, `n` which is at least 1**.

To be more precise and align with the provided constraints, we can specify that the input to `range()` is `n` from one of the test cases, which is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer n such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; the input to `range()` is `n` which is at least 3**.
