The code snippet assigns an empty string to the variable `word`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `alphabet` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is mentioned to be incremented by 1 in the initial state, but the provided code snippet does not show any increment operation, so `i` is not affected by the given code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1, `word` is an empty string.**
