The code snippet appends a substring from the `alphabet` string to the `word` string. Given `n` is the input integer, the character at the position `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string is selected. Since `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the valid range for `n` to select a character from `alphabet` is 53 to 78 (given the length of `alphabet` is 26).

Given the initial state, `word` is an empty string. After the execution of `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`, `word` becomes the character at position `n - 53` in `alphabet` followed by 'zz'.

For example, if `n` is 53, `word` becomes 'a' + 'zz' which is 'azz'. If `n` is 78, `word` becomes 'z' + 'zz' which is 'zzz'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1, `word` is the character at position `n - 53` in `alphabet` followed by 'zz'.**
