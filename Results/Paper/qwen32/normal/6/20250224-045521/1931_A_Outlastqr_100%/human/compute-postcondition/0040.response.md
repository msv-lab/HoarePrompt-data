Output State: **The loop has completed all `t` iterations, and for each iteration, a `word` has been constructed and printed based on the value of `n`. The variable `i` has reached the value of `t`, and `alphabet` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished running for all `t` test cases, and for each test case, a specific `word` was generated and printed according to the rules provided. The loop counter `i` now equals the total number of test cases `t`, and the `alphabet` string has not been modified.
