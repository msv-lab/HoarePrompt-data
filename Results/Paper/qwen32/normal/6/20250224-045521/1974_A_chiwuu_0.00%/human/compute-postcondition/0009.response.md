Output State: **`t` is equal to `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`, `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input, and `t` is not divisible by 5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The condition that `t` is not divisible by 5 is still valid after the update.
