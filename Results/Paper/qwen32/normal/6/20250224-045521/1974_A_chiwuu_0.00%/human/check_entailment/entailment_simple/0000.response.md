### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens required to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a 5x3 grid.

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons (`t`).
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 5x3 screen has 15 cells.
   - To determine the number of screens needed for `b` 2x2 icons, the program multiplies `b` by 2 (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, which is equivalent to 2 "units" of 2 cells each) and then divides by 5 (since 5 "units" of 2 cells fit into one screen).
   - If `t * 5` is not a perfect multiple of `b * 4`, it adds an extra screen.

3. **Calculation of Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons (`t1`).
   - It subtracts the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons (`b * 4`) from the total number of cells in `t` screens (`t * 15`).
   - If the remaining cells (`t1`) are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`a`), no additional screens are needed.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the program calculates the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2`).

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total number of screens required by adding the screens needed for 2x2 icons (`t`) and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons (`t2`).

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Calculation: `t = 1`, `t1 = 15 - 4 = 11`, `t2 = 1 - 11 = -10` (no additional screens needed)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `7 2`
   - Calculation: `t = 1`, `t1 = 15 - 8 = 7`, `t2 = 7 - 7 = 0` (no additional screens needed)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `12 4`
   - Calculation: `t = 2`, `t1 = 30 - 16 = 14`, `t2 = 12 - 14 = -2` (no additional screens needed)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `0 3`
   - Calculation: `t = 2`, `t1 = 30 - 12 = 18`, `t2 = 0 - 18 = -18` (no additional screens needed)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `1 0`
   - Calculation: `t = 0`, `t1 = 0 - 0 = 0`, `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1` (additional screen needed)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `8 1`
   - Calculation: `t = 1`, `t1 = 15 - 4 = 11`, `t2 = 8 - 11 = -3` (no additional screens needed)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `0 0`
   - Calculation: `t = 0`, `t1 = 0 - 0 = 0`, `t2 = 0 - 0 = 0` (no additional screens needed)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - Input: `2 0`
   - Calculation: `t = 0`, `t1 = 0 - 0 = 0`, `t2 = 2 - 0 = 2` (additional screens needed)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

9. **Test Case 9:**
   - Input: `15 0`
   - Calculation: `t = 0`, `t1 = 0 - 0 = 0`, `t2 = 15 - 0 = 15` (additional screens needed)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

10. **Test Case 10:**
    - Input: `8 2`
    - Calculation: `t = 1`, `t1 = 15 - 8 = 7`, `t2 = 8 - 7 = 1` (additional screen needed)
    - Output: `2` (Correct)

11. **Test Case 11:**
    - Input: `0 9`
    - Calculation: `t = 5`, `t1 = 75 - 36 = 39`, `t2 = 0 - 39 = -39` (no additional screens needed)
    - Output: `5` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case based on the provided logic and the example test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
