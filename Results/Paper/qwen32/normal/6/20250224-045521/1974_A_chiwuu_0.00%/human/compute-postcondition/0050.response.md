Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is greater than `k + 2`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1 + t2 // 15`.**

The value of `t` is updated to its previous value plus the integer division of `t2` by 15. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions.
