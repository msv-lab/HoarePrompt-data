Output State: **`t` is `b * 2`, `a` is the first integer from the new input (converted to an integer), `b` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` is now twice the value of `b`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
