Output State: **`t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5`, `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input, and `t` is divisible by 5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be `t // 5`, which means it is now equal to `b * 2 // 5`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The condition that `t` is divisible by 5 still holds because the original `t` was divisible by 5, and integer division by 5 maintains this divisibility property.
