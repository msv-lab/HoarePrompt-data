You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: the value of `t` after the `n`-th iteration, as determined by the last update in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates a value `t` based on specific conditions and prints this value. The purpose of the function is to process each pair of integers `a` and `b` and output a computed value `t` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for all cases. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample.

The program attempts to calculate the minimum number of screens required by first placing the 2x2 icons and then placing the 1x1 icons. However, the way it handles the placement of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
14 1
```
Here, there are 14 applications with 1x1 icons and 1 application with a 2x2 icon.

The correct approach would be to place the 2x2 icon first, which occupies 4 cells. This leaves 11 cells available on the first screen. The remaining 14 - 11 = 3 1x1 icons can fit on the first screen as well, so no additional screens are needed. Thus, the correct answer is 1 screen.

However, the given program calculates:
- `t = b * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2`
- `t = 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (since 2 is not divisible by 5)
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 15 - 4 = 11`
- Since `t1 >= a` is not true (11 < 14), it calculates:
  - `t2 = a - t1 = 14 - 11 = 3`
  - `t = 1 + 3 // 15 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2` (since 3 is not divisible by 15)

Thus, the program outputs 2 screens for this test case, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not handle all cases properly, and the Correctness is **False**.
