To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variable `t` is updated with each iteration. The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, updates `t` based on the conditions provided, and prints the final value of `t` for each iteration.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initialization**: The initial value of `t` is provided, and `n` determines the number of iterations.
2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each iteration, two integers `a` and `b` are read.
   - `t` is updated based on the following logic:
     - First, `t` is set to `b * 2`. If `t` is divisible by 5, it is divided by 5; otherwise, it is divided by 5 and rounded up.
     - Then, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
     - If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`. `t` is then updated based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15 or not.
   - The updated value of `t` is printed for each iteration.

The output state after all iterations is simply the final value of `t` after the last iteration of the loop. Since `t` is updated in each iteration and printed, the final printed value of `t` after the `n`-th iteration is the output state.

Given that the output state after the first three iterations has been described, we can infer that the final output state will be the value of `t` after the `n`-th iteration. Since the problem does not provide specific values for `a` and `b` for each iteration, we can only describe the final state in terms of the last iteration's update.

Output State: **the value of `t` after the `n`-th iteration, as determined by the last update in the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the final value of `t` after all `n` iterations of the loop have been completed, where `t` is updated in each iteration based on the input values `a` and `b` and the conditions provided in the loop.
