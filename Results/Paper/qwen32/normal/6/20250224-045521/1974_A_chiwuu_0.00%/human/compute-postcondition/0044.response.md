The code snippet `t = t // 5` modifies the value of `t` by performing integer division by 5. The initial value of `t` is `b * 2`. After the operation, `t` becomes `(b * 2) // 5`.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is greater than `k + 2`, `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `(b * 2)` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t1` is `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is `(b * 2) // 5`**.
