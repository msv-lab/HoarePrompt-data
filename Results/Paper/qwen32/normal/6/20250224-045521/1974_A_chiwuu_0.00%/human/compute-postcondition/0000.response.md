The code provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range and that there are `t` test cases, each with two integers `x` and `y`. However, the code snippet does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, or `y`. It only introduces a new variable `n` which is assigned the value from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is an input integer.**
