The value of `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `n`, and `t1` remain as specified in the initial state, except for `t2`, which is now defined as the result of the subtraction.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `(b * 2)` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t1` is `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**
