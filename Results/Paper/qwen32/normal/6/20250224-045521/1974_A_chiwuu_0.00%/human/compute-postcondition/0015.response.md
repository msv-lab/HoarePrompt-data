The code snippet assigns the value of `a - t1` to the variable `t2`. Given the initial state, `t1` is already defined as `t * 15 - b * 4` and it is less than `a`. Therefore, `t2` will be the difference between `a` and `t1`.

Output State: **`t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5` if `t` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is equal to `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`; `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input; `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`; `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**
