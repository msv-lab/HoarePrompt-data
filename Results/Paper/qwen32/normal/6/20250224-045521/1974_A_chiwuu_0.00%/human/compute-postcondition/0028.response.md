The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5`, where `t` was initially `b * 2`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is now the integer division of `b * 2` by 5.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5`; `a` is the first integer from the new input (converted to an integer); `b` is the second integer from the new input; `i` is `k + 1`; `n` is greater than `k + 1`.**
