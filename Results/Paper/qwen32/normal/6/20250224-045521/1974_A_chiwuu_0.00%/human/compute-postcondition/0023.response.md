The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` must be greater than that value for the loop to execute again.

Since the task specifies that we need to adjust the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration. The value of `n` remains the same as it determines the total number of iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer, `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the program does not change `t`. Otherwise, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same.**

To be more specific, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer, `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`.**
