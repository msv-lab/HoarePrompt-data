To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement given the initial state, we need to analyze the context and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their states:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
   - `n`: An input integer and must be greater than 0. This variable also does not directly affect the `print(i)` statement.
   - `arr`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `mpp`: A `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
   - `first`: A boolean variable.
   - `i`: An integer variable that is incremented in a loop and checked against the keys in the `mpp` dictionary.

2. **Behavior of the loop and conditions:**
   - The loop increments `i` and checks if `i` is a key in the `mpp` dictionary.
   - If `first` is `True` and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1, the loop breaks.
   - If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the loop breaks.

Given the provided information, the exact value of `i` when the `print(i)` statement is executed depends on the loop's behavior, which in turn depends on the contents of `arr` and the value of `first`.

However, we can describe the value of `i` in terms of the loop's termination condition:
- If `first` is `True` and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1, the loop breaks, and `i` will be the first integer that appears exactly once in `arr`.
- If `first` is `False` or the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is not 1, the loop continues until `i` is no longer a key in `mpp`.

Without specific values for `arr` and `first`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i`. However, we can describe its value based on the conditions given.

Output: **i (where i is the integer that meets the loop's termination condition based on the contents of arr and the value of first)**
