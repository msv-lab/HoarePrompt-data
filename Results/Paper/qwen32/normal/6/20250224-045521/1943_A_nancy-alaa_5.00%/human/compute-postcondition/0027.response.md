To determine what will be printed when the `print(i)` statement is executed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. This variable is not relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
2. **`n`**: An input integer that must be greater than 0. This variable is also not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
3. **`arr`**: A list of integers obtained from the input. This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
4. **`mpp`**: A `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`. This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
5. **`first`**: A boolean variable. This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
6. **`i`**: The variable `i` is defined as `i + 1`. This implies that `i` is being incremented by 1.

### Analysis:
The key point here is the definition of `i` as `i + 1`. This suggests that `i` is being incremented by 1 at some point in the code, but the exact value of `i` before this increment is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the value of `i` as it is after the increment.

### Output:
Since the exact initial value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe the final value of `i` as `i + 1`.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is the value of i before the increment)**
