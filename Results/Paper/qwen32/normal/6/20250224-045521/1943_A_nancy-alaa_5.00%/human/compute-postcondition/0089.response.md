The only variable in the loop head is `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used in the range from `0` to `n-1`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:
- At the end of the last iteration, `i` had a specific value (let's call it `i_prev`).
- The loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide the specific value of `i`, we can only express the state in terms of the incremented value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`; `first` is a boolean value; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

However, to provide a more concrete state, let's assume `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the last iteration. Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`; `first` is a boolean value; `i` is `i_prev + 1` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since the exact value of `i_prev` is not provided, we can simplify it to the general form:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`; `first` is a boolean value; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For clarity and to adhere to the format:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`; `first` is a boolean value; `i` is incremented by 1**.
