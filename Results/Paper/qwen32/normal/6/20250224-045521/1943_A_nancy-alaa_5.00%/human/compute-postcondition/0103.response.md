Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`; `first` is a boolean value; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
