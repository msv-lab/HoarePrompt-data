The `break` statement in the given code snippet will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, or `i` will be modified by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is True; `i` is a key in the `mpp` dictionary with a frequency of 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
