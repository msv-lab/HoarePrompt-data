### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a`.
- Alice tries to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`, while Bob tries to minimize it.
- Both players play optimally.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. It then iterates through possible values from `0` to `n-1` to find the MEX. The logic used in the program is:
1. If a value `i` is not in the `Counter` keys, it prints `i` and breaks.
2. If a value `i` is present exactly once and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks.
3. If a value `i` is present exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary suggests that the program prints the smallest non-negative integer that is either missing from the list or appears exactly once. However, this does not align with the optimal strategy required by the problem.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply checks the counts and prints the MEX without considering the game dynamics.
2. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal play by Alice and Bob. It only checks for the presence of elements and their counts, which does not account for the strategic removal of elements by Bob.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game:
1. Use a set to keep track of elements that have been added to `c`.
2. Use a list to simulate the array `a` and remove elements as they are chosen by Alice and Bob.
3. After each turn, calculate the MEX of the current state of `c`.

However, there is a more efficient way to determine the MEX without simulating each turn:
- The MEX of `c` at the end of the game is determined by the counts of elements in `a`.
- If an element `i` appears an even number of times, it will not affect the MEX because Bob can always remove one of its occurrences.
- If an element `i` appears an odd number of times, it will be added to `c` by Alice, and we need to find the smallest such `i`.

#### Correct Solution:
The correct solution involves:
1. Counting the occurrences of each element.
2. Finding the smallest element that appears an odd number of times.

Given the function summary and the provided program, it is clear that the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy or the correct logic to determine the MEX.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob and does not correctly determine the MEX based on the counts of elements.

**Final: False**
