The code creates a `Counter` object `mpp` from the list `arr`, which counts the frequency of each element in `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but `mpp` is now a `Counter` object reflecting the counts of elements in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.**
