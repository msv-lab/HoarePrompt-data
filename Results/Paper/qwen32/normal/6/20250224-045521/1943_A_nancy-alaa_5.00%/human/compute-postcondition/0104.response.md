Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`; `first` is a boolean value; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next instructions without breaking.**
