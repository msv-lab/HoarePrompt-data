Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is `i + 2`. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
