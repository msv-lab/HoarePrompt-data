Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
2. **`n`**: An input integer and must be greater than 0. This variable represents the number of elements in the list `arr`.
3. **`arr`**: A list of integers obtained from the input. The exact values in this list are not specified, but it contains `n` integers.
4. **`mpp`**: A `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`. This means `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are the unique elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts.
5. **`first`**: A boolean variable set to `True`. This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
6. **`i`**: A key in the `mpp` dictionary with a frequency of 1. This means `i` is an element in `arr` that appears exactly once.

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is specifically defined as a key in the `mpp` dictionary that has a frequency of 1. This means `i` is an element in `arr` that occurs exactly once.
- Since `i` is the key with a frequency of 1, it is one of the unique elements in `arr` that appears only once.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is an element in `arr` that appears exactly once. However, without knowing the specific values in `arr`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i`. We can only describe it as the element with a frequency of 1 in the list `arr`.

### Output:
Output: **i (where i is an element in arr that appears exactly once)**
