To determine the output of the given `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and how the variable `i` is defined and used.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- `first` is a boolean.
- `i` is defined as `i + 2`. However, the exact initial value of `i` is not provided, so we can only infer that `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration or step.
- If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Focus on `i`:
The variable `i` is incremented by 2 each time, but its initial value is not specified. The `print(i)` statement will output the current value of `i` at the point where it is executed.

### Output Determination:
Since the initial value of `i` is not provided, we can only say that `i` is an integer that has been incremented by 2 from its initial value. The exact value of `i` depends on how many times it has been incremented before the `print(i)` statement is executed.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided, the most precise description of what is printed is the current value of `i`. Since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we express the output in terms of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the current value after being incremented by 2 from its initial value)**
