Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n-1` and checks if the number is in the `Counter` dictionary `mpp`.
   - If the number is not in `mpp`, it prints the number and breaks the loop.
   - If the number is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, and if `first` is `True`, it prints the number and breaks the loop.
   - If the number is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

   This logic does not correctly simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob, nor does it correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c`. The program does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively.

2. **Optimal Play Not Considered:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not consider the effect of their choices on the final composition of `c`.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The program does not handle cases where certain numbers are missing from the input array.
   - It does not handle cases where all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are present in the input array with varying frequencies.

### Example Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

- **Expected Output:** `3`
  - Alice can choose `2` first, leaving `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
  - Bob can choose `0`, leaving `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
  - Alice can choose `1`, leaving `a = [2]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
  - Bob can choose `2`, leaving `a = []` and `c = [2, 1]`.
  - The MEX of `[2, 1]` is `0`, but the optimal play leads to `c = [0, 1, 2]` with MEX `3`.

- **Actual Output:** `0`
  - The program will print `0` because `0` is not in the `Counter` dictionary `mpp` initially.

Thus, the program does not correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c` after optimal play by Alice and Bob. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
