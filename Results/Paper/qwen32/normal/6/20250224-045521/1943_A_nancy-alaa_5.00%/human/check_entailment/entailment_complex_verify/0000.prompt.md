You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: t is 0; n is undefined; arr is undefined; mpp is undefined; first is undefined; i is undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest non-negative integer that is either missing from the list or appears exactly once, ensuring that if there are multiple such integers, the smallest one is chosen.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n-1` and checks if the number is in the `Counter` dictionary `mpp`.
   - If the number is not in `mpp`, it prints the number and breaks the loop.
   - If the number is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, and if `first` is `True`, it prints the number and breaks the loop.
   - If the number is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

   This logic does not correctly simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob, nor does it correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c`. The program does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively.

2. **Optimal Play Not Considered:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not consider the effect of their choices on the final composition of `c`.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The program does not handle cases where certain numbers are missing from the input array.
   - It does not handle cases where all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are present in the input array with varying frequencies.

### Example Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

- **Expected Output:** `3`
  - Alice can choose `2` first, leaving `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
  - Bob can choose `0`, leaving `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
  - Alice can choose `1`, leaving `a = [2]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
  - Bob can choose `2`, leaving `a = []` and `c = [2, 1]`.
  - The MEX of `[2, 1]` is `0`, but the optimal play leads to `c = [0, 1, 2]` with MEX `3`.

- **Actual Output:** `0`
  - The program will print `0` because `0` is not in the `Counter` dictionary `mpp` initially.

Thus, the program does not correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c` after optimal play by Alice and Bob. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
