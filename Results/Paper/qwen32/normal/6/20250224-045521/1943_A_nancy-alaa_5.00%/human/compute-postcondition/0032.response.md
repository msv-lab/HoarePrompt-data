Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is `i + 1`. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the execution continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
