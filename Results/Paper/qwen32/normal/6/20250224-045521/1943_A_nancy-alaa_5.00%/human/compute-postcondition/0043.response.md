Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1.
2. `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0.
3. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
4. `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
5. `first` is False.
6. `i` is 0 and `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- The fact that `i` is not a key in `mpp` does not affect the value of `i` itself, it only provides information about the contents of the `mpp` Counter object.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
