The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and the length of `nums` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input line with `0` inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is now greater than 3. If the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is 1, then `cd` is 1. Otherwise, `cd` is 0 and the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `i` is 4.**
