Output State: **The program returns Alice**

Explanation: The program executes the `print('Alice')` statement, which outputs the string 'Alice'. Since the `return` statement is used with the `print` function, the return value of the `print` function (which is `None` in Python) is what is technically returned. However, the visible output to the user is the string 'Alice'. For the purposes of this task, we describe the output as the string 'Alice' being returned.
