The code snippet provided increments the value of `cd` by 1. The initial state specifies that `cd` is 0, and no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, `cd` will now be 1.

Output State: **N is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input line with `0` inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is now greater than 3; `cd` is 1.**
