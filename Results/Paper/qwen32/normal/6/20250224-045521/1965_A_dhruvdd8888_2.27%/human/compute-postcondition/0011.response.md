To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and the expression `len(nums) - 2`.

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: This is the loop variable that will take values starting from 0 up to `len(nums) - 3` (since the range is exclusive of the end value).
2. **`len(nums) - 2`**: This determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(nums) - 2` must be greater than 0, which means `len(nums)` must be at least 2.

### Given State:
- `N` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input line with `0` inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is now greater than 3.
- `cd` is 0.

### Required Adjustments:
- The length of `nums` is already stated to be greater than 3, which means `len(nums) - 2` will definitely be greater than 0. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once.
- The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is initialized automatically by the `range` function in the loop.
- The variable `N` and `cd` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
Since the length of `nums` is already greater than 3, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The state remains the same with respect to the loop head.

State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input line with `0` inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is now greater than 3; `cd` is 0**.
