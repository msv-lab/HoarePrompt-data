Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input line with `0` inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is now greater than 3. If the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is 1, then `cd` is 1. Otherwise, `cd` is 0 and the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `i` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
