The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The initial value of `c` is 0, so after the execution of this line, `c` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `l[x]`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 1; and `l[x]` is greater than `b`.**
