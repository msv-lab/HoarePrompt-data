Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains `float('inf')` and `c` remains 0; otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` remains `float('inf')`, and `c` is updated to 1.**
