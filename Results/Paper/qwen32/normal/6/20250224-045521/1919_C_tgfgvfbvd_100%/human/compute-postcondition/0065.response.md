The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state will reflect the incremented value of `c`, while all other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `x + 1`; `a` is `l[x]`; If `a` was greater than `b` before the assignment, then `a` is now the previous value of `b` and `b` is now the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `c` is `c + 1`.**
