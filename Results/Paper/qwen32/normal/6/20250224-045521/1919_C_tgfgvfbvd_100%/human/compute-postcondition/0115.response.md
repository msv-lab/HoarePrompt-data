Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is incremented by 1. If `l[x] <= b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x] > b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `a > b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped.**
