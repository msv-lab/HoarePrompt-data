Output State: **t is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - (number of iterations executed); n is the integer obtained from the input; l is the list of integers obtained from the input; a is the smallest element in l; b is the second smallest element in l; c is the count of elements in l that are greater than both a and b.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- For each test case, `n` will be the number of elements in the list `l`.
- The list `l` will be the list of integers obtained from the input for the current test case.
- The variable `a` will hold the smallest element in the list `l`.
- The variable `b` will hold the second smallest element in the list `l`, or remain as `float('inf')` if there is no second smallest element.
- The variable `c` will count how many elements in the list `l` are greater than both `a` and `b`.
