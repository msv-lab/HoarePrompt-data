The code snippet `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is `float('inf')` and `b` is also `float('inf')`. After the swap, `a` will still be `float('inf')` and `b` will still be `float('inf')`. The condition `a` is greater than `b` was false initially because both `a` and `b` were equal. After the swap, the condition `a` is greater than `b` remains false for the same reason.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0; `a` is not greater than `b`**.
