Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `x + 1`. If `a` was greater than `b`, then `a` is now the previous value of `b` and `b` is now the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
