Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = float('inf'), float('inf')
    c = 0
    for x in range(n):
        if a > b:
            a, b = b, a
        if l[x] <= a:
            a = l[x]
        elif l[x] <= b:
            b = l[x]
        else:
            a = l[x]
            c += 1
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the number of elements in the list `l`; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is the smallest element in `l`; `b` is the second smallest element in `l` if it exists, otherwise `float('inf')`; `c` is the count of elements greater than the second smallest element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer obtained from the input; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is the smallest element in `l`; `b` is the second smallest element in `l`; `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are larger than both `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; n is the integer obtained from the input; l is the new list of integers obtained from the input; a is the smallest element in l; b is the second smallest element in l; c is the count of elements in l that are greater than both a and b.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
