The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Given that initially `a` is `float('inf')` and `b` is also `float('inf')`, after the swap, `a` will still be `float('inf')` and `b` will still be `float('inf')`. The condition `a` is greater than `b` will remain unchanged because both `a` and `b` are still `float('inf')`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `l`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0; `a` is greater than `b`.**
