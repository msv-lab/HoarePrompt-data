Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `k + 2`. If `l[x] <= a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged; otherwise, if `l[x] <= b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`; if `l[x] > b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `a` was greater than `b` before the if-else block, then `a` and `b` have swapped values; otherwise, `a` and `b` remain in their updated states.**
