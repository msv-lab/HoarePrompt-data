To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the code and the given initial state.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user such that \(1 \leq n \leq 26\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 26\).

### Code to be executed:
```python
print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
```

### Explanation:
1. **String Slicing**:
   - `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` takes the first `k` characters from the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
   - Since `k` is between 1 and 26, this will result in a substring of the alphabet starting from 'a' up to the `k`-th letter.

2. **String Multiplication**:
   - The substring obtained from the slicing operation is then multiplied by `n`.
   - This means the substring will be repeated `n` times.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `k` is 5 and `n` is 3:
  - `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:5]` results in `'abcde'`.
  - `'abcde' * 3` results in `'abcdeabcdeabcde'`.

### General Output:
- The output will be a string consisting of the first `k` letters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times.

### Final Output:
Output: **the first k letters of the alphabet repeated n times** (where k is the number of letters to take from the start of the alphabet and n is the number of times to repeat this substring)
