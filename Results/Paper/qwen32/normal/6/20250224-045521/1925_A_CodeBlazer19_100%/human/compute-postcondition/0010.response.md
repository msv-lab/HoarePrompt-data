Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 676; `i` is `t-1`; `n` and `k` are the two space-separated integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will have reached the value `t-1`, which is the last iteration index. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values provided by the user in the last iteration. The state of `t` remains unchanged as it is the total number of iterations specified by the user.
