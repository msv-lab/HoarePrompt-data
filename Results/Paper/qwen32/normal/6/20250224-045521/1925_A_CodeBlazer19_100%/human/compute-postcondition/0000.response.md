The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means the value of `t` will be updated based on the user's input. The preconditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**
