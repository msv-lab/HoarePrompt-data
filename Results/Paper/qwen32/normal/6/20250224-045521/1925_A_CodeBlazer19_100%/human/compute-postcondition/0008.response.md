The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a new input from the user, which is expected to be two space-separated integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The initial values of `n` and `k` provided in the initial state are overwritten by these new values.

The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 676; `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are the two space-separated integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**
