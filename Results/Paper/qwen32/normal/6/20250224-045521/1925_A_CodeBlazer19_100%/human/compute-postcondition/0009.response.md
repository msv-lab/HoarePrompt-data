To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the code and use the provided initial state:

1. **Variables and Initial State**:
   - `t`: An integer input by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\). This variable is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored for this specific task.
   - `i`: Set to 2. This variable is also not used in the print statement.
   - `n`: A space-separated integer provided by the user such that \(1 \leq n \leq 26\).
   - `k`: A space-separated integer provided by the user such that \(1 \leq k \leq 26\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The print statement is `print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)`.
   - `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` slices the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' up to the \(k\)-th character. This means it will take the first \(k\) letters of the alphabet.
   - `* n` repeats the sliced string \(n\) times.

3. **Output Description**:
   - The output will be the first \(k\) letters of the alphabet repeated \(n\) times.

Putting this together, the output can be described as follows:
- The first \(k\) letters of the alphabet are taken.
- This substring is then repeated \(n\) times.

Therefore, the final output is:

Output: **the first \(k\) letters of the alphabet repeated \(n\) times**.
