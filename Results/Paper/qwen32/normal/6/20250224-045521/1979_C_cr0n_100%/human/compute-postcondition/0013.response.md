The provided Python code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement. The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the value to be printed is explicitly given by the `print` statement itself.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N`: An integer representing the number of outcomes.
   - `vals`: A list of integers where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning.
   - `den`: The value returned by applying `func_1` iteratively to the initial `den` (which is `vals[0]`) and each subsequent element in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`.
   - `vprod`: A list of integers where each element is the result of `den // r` for `r` in `vals`.
   - The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(-1)` statement directly outputs the integer `-1`.

Since the `print` statement explicitly outputs `-1`, the values of the variables (`N`, `vals`, `den`, `vprod`) do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement. The task is to determine exactly what will be printed, and in this case, it is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
