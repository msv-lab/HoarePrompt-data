Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals`. It calculates a value `den` by iteratively applying `func_1` to the elements of `vals`. It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`. It subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as space-separated values. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`.**
