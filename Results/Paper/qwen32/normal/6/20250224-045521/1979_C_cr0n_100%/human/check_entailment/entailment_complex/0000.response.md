### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to distribute the bets on `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The solution strategy involves finding a suitable distribution of bets that meets this condition.

The provided code follows these steps:

1. **Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM):** The function `func_1` calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`. The function `func_2` then iteratively applies `func_1` to all multipliers provided in the input to get the LCM of all multipliers.

2. **Determine the Bet Distribution:** The variable `den` is the LCM of all multipliers. The code then calculates a list `vprod` where each element is the integer division of `den` by the corresponding multiplier. This ensures that the sum of all bets (which is the sum of `vprod`) is less than `den`.

3. **Check Feasibility:** The code then subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. If the resulting value is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it prints the bet distribution `vprod`.

### Analysis:

- **LCM Calculation:** The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the sum of the bets (which is the sum of `vprod`) will be strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome because `den` is a multiple of each multiplier.

- **Bet Distribution:** The bet distribution `vprod` is derived by dividing `den` by each multiplier. This ensures that the sum of the bets is less than `den`, and thus, the condition is satisfied for any winning outcome.

- **Feasibility Check:** The check `if (den <= 0)` ensures that the bet distribution is feasible. If `den` is less than or equal to the sum of the bets (which is the sum of `vprod`), then it is impossible to distribute the bets as required, and the function correctly prints `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the bet distribution that satisfies the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
