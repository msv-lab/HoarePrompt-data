The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def find_bets(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. Each `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and each `k_i` is an integer (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). The sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
