You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of outcomes, and vals is a list of integers representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning. Each element in vals is an integer such that 2 <= vals[i] <= 20.
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: N is an integer representing the number of outcomes, vals is a list of integers where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and den is the value returned by applying func_1 iteratively to the initial den (which is vals[0]) and each subsequent element in vals.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: N is an integer representing the number of outcomes, vals is a list of integers where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, den is the value returned by applying func_1 iteratively to the initial den (which is vals[0]) and each subsequent element in vals minus the sum of vprod, vprod is a list of integers where each element is the result of den // r for r in vals, and den is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [space-separated values of vprod] (where each value is the result of den // r for r in vals)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It always returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
