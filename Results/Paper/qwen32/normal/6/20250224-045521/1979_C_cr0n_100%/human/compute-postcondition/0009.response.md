To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the list `vals` and how the variable `den` changes with each iteration. The loop iterates over each element in the `vals` list, updating `den` by applying the function `func_1` to the current `den` and the current element `x` from `vals`.

Given:
- `N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes.
- `vals` is a list of integers where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning.
- `den` is initially set to `vals[0]`.

The loop executes for each element in `vals`, so after all iterations, `den` will have been updated by `func_1` for each element in `vals`.

Output State: **N is an integer representing the number of outcomes, vals is a list of integers where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and den is the value returned by applying func_1 iteratively to the initial den (which is vals[0]) and each subsequent element in vals.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, `den` will hold the final value resulting from applying `func_1` to `den` and each element of `vals` in sequence. The values of `N` and `vals` remain unchanged, while `den` reflects the cumulative effect of all the `func_1` applications.
