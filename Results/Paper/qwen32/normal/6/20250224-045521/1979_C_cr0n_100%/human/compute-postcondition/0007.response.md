The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `vals`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `vals` list and the variable `x`. If `vals` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the current element from `vals`, and `vals` is a list of integers with at least one element.

To execute the loop one more time, `vals` must have at least one more element after the current `x`. The variable `x` will then be assigned the next element in `vals`.

State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers with at least two elements where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, `den` is the value returned by `func_1(den, x)`. `x` is the next element in `vals`.**
