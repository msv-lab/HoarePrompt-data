The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is the loop variable iterating over `vals`. Therefore, the state of `x` needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` holds the value of the last element processed in `vals`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must take the value of the next element in `vals`.

Given that `vals` is a list with at least one element, and assuming we have processed `k` elements in the previous iterations, `x` should now hold the value of the `(k+1)`-th element in `vals`.

State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and `den` is the value returned by `func_1(den, x)`. `x` is the next element in `vals` after the last processed element.** 

Since we do not have the specific value of the next element in `vals`, we can express the state as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and `den` is the value returned by `func_1(den, x)`. `x` is the next element in `vals`.**
