Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` (and `k0`) is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2. If `k` is odd, then `arr` is [0]. Otherwise, `arr` remains [].**
