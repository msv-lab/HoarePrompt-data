The `break` statement does not affect the variables in the given initial state. It only terminates the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Since no loop or conditional block is mentioned in the initial state, the `break` statement does not change any variable values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `arr` is [0], `ans` is [1], `c` is `n - 1`.**
