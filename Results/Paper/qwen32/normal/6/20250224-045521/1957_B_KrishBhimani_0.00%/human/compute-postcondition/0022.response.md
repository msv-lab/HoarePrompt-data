To determine the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop behaves and the conditions under which it terminates.

The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero. In each iteration:
- If `k` is odd (i.e., `k & 1 == 1`), the current index `i` is appended to the list `arr`.
- `k` is then right-shifted by 1 bit (`k = k >> 1`), effectively dividing it by 2.
- The index `i` is incremented by 1.

The loop terminates when `k` becomes zero. This means that all the bits of the initial value `k0` have been processed.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` (denoted as `k0` initially).
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `k0` is equal to `k`.
- `i` is 0.

The loop will run until `k` becomes 0. The final state of `arr` will contain the indices where the corresponding bits in `k0` were set to 1.

To describe the final state in a human-readable format:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `l1` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` is 0.
- `k0` remains unchanged.
- `i` is equal to the number of bits in `k0` (i.e., `i` is the number of iterations the loop ran).
- `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; l1 is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; n is the integer value of the first element of l1; k is 0; k0 is equal to the initial value of k; i is the number of bits in the binary representation of k0; arr is a list of indices where the corresponding bits in k0 are set to 1.**
