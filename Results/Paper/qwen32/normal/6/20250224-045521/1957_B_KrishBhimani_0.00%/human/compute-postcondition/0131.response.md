The code snippet provided appends `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is the next element in `arr`, which is a list containing the indices of the set bits in the original `k`. The variable `ans` now includes an additional element `1 << i`.

The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, and `c` remain unchanged by this single line of code. The variable `c` is incremented by 1 elsewhere in the code, but that operation is not part of the given snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is an integer with at least one set bit, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the set bits in the original `k`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` includes an additional element `1 << i`.**
