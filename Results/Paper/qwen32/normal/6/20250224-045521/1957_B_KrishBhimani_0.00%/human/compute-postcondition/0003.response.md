The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `arr`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables, except for the addition of the new variable `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list.**
