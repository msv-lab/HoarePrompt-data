The code assigns the value of `k` to a new variable `k0`. The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`.**
