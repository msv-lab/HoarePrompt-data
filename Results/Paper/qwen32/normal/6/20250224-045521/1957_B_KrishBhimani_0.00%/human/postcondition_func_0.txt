The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates a list of length `n` where each element is either a power of 2 corresponding to a set bit in `k` or `0`, ensuring the sum of the elements in the list is less than or equal to `k`. The function outputs these lists, one for each test case.
