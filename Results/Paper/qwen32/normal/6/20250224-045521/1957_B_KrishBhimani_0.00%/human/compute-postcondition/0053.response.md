To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `while k:`. This loop will execute as long as `k` is a non-zero value.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` (Note: `k` and `k0` are the same variable here, so this is redundant information)
- `i` is 0
- `arr` is []
- `ans` is [2, -2]
- `c` is 2

Since the loop condition is `while k:`, we need to ensure that `k` is a non-zero value. Right before the loop, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`. To make sure the loop can execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` (and `k0`) is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is [], `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2**
