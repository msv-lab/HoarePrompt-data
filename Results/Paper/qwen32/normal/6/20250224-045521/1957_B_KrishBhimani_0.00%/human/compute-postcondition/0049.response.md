The code snippet assigns the values from the list `l1` to the variables `n` and `k` after converting them to integers. Given that `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, the first element of `l1` will be assigned to `n` and the second element to `k`.

Since the specific values of the elements in `l1` are not provided, we can only say that `n` will take the integer value of the first element of `l1` and `k` will take the integer value of the second element of `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0], `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2.**
