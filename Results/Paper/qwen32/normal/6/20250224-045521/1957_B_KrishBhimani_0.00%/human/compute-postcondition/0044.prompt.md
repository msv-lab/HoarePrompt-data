Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is equal to the initial value of `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` is a list of indices where the corresponding bits in `k0` are set to 1; `ans` is an empty list; `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `arr` is [0], `ans` is [1, 2] if `c` was `n - 1` before the if statement, otherwise `ans` is [2], and `c` is `c + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`. If `c` was `n - 1` before the if statement, `ans` is `[1, 2, -2, 2]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is `[2, -1, 2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, `c` is `c + 2`, and `ans` is [2, -1, 2, 2]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
