The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the integer value of `k0 // 4`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0.

To ensure that `k` is greater than 0, `k0` must be at least 4 (since `k0 // 4` will be 1 if `k0` is 4, which is greater than 0).

Therefore, we need to adjust `k0` to be at least 4, and consequently, `k` will be at least 1, ensuring the loop can execute one more time. The states of other variables do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k0` is at least 4; `k` is the integer value of `k0 // 4` and must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `arr` is either `[1]` if `k0` is odd, or `arr` remains an empty list if `k0` is even.**
