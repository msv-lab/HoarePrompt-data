The code snippet `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length equals `n`. Given that `n` is 2 and `ans` is initially `[2, -2]`, the length of `ans` is already 2, so no zeros are appended.

Therefore, the list `ans` remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, and `c`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is 2, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0], `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2.**
