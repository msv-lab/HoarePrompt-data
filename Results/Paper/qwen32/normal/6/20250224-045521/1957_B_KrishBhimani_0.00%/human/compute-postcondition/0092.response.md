The code snippet appends zeros to the list `ans` until the length of `ans` is equal to `n`. Given that `ans` initially contains `n` elements (from the first `n` elements being `1 << arr[i]` and the last element being `k0 - sum(ans)`), the length of `ans` is already `n`. Therefore, appending zeros does not change the length of `ans`.

Thus, the state of `ans` remains the same, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` contains the indices where the bits of some number (not necessarily `k`) were 1, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`.**
