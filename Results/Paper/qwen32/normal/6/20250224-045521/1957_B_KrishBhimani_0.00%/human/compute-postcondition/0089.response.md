Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `c` is 2. If `c` was equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is `[k0, 1 << i, -(1 << i), 1 << i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `ans` remains as it was before the if statement.

The code snippet provided is:
```
c += 1
```

This increments the value of `c` by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this increment operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `c` is 3. If `c` was equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is `[k0, 1 << i, -(1 << i), 1 << i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `ans` remains as it was before the if statement.**
