The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will terminate the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in. However, since there is no loop or if statement provided in the context, the `break` statement does not affect any of the variables or the flow in the given initial state.

Therefore, the values of all the variables remain unchanged. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `c` is 1, `ans` is either `[1 << i, k0 - (1 << i)]` if `c` was less than `n - 1`, or `[k0, 1 << i, - (1 << i)]` if `c` was equal to `n - 1`**.
