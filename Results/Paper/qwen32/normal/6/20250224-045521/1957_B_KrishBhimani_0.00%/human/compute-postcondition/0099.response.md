Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as no other changes were made to them.
