The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ans`. The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, and `arr`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is equal to the initial value of `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` is a list of indices where the corresponding bits in `k0` are set to 1; `ans` is an empty list.**
