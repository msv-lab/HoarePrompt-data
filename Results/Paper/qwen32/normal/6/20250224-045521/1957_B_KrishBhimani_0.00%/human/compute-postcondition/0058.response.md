The code snippet provided only increments the value of the variable `i` by 1. Therefore, the value of `i` changes from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is `k >> 1` (which is equivalent to `k // 2`), `k0` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2. If `k` is odd, then `arr` is [0]. Otherwise, `arr` remains [].**
