The code appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, which is 1. Therefore, `1 << i` is `1 << 1`, which equals 2. The list `ans` will now have an additional element, 2, appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `arr` is [0], `ans` is [1, 2] if `c` was `n - 1` before the if statement, otherwise `ans` is [2], and `c` is `c + 1`.**
