The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which should be the number of iterations `t`. 

Given the state before the loop starts is that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` matches this condition. Since the loop uses `int(input())` to determine how many times to iterate, we need to make sure that the input is set to `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is `t`, which is already given to be between 1 and 10^4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input to `int(input())` is `t`**
