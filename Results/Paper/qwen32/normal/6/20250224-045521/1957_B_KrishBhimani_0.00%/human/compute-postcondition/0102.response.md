Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is a non-zero integer value of the second element of the original `l1` and `k & 1 == 1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is a list containing the value [0], `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The value of `arr` has been updated to `[0]` by appending `i` (which is 0). All other variables remain unchanged.
