The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the set bits in the original `k`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[]`, and `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `k` plus one.**
