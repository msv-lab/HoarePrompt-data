To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition that controls the loop, which is `while k:`. This loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is not zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is `k >> 1` (equivalent to `k // 2`)
- `k0` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is [2, -2]
- `c` is 2
- If `k` is odd, then `arr` is [0]. Otherwise, `arr` remains []

To make the loop execute one more time, `k` must be non-zero. Since `k` is being halved (`k >> 1`) in each iteration, to ensure `k` is non-zero for the next iteration, `k` must be at least 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` must be at least 1, `k0` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2. If `k` is odd, then `arr` is [0]. Otherwise, `arr` remains []**
