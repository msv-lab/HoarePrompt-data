The code snippet `tmp = a[0]` assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `_` is one less than `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `tmp` is the first element of `a`; `cnt` is the count of consecutive `tmp` at the end of the list or 0; `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive `tmp` found during the loop or the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
