### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its function summary in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. An array is beautiful if, for any index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)), if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \), then we can replace \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) and still have a beautiful array.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to find the shortest contiguous subarray of the same elements starting from the first element and uses its length to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. If the entire array is made up of the same element or if the array length is 1, it outputs `-1`.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary correctly describes the logic of the provided code: it finds the shortest contiguous subarray starting from the first element and uses its length to decide the output.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims the code is incorrect, citing a counterexample where the code outputs `-1` for an array that should require removing 3 elements.

#### Evaluation:
Let's verify the counterexample provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
The array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` is beautiful. To make it non-beautiful, we can remove the first three `3`s, resulting in `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

**Actual Output of the Provided Code:**
The provided code will indeed output `-1` for this input. Here's why:
1. The code starts by setting `tmp` to the first element (`3`).
2. It then iterates through the array, counting the length of the contiguous subarray starting from the first element (`3`).
3. The length of this subarray is `3`.
4. Since the length of this subarray (`3`) is not less than the total length of the array (`7`), the code outputs `-1`.

This behavior aligns with the code's logic but does not meet the problem's requirements. The code fails to consider other possible subarrays and their lengths to determine the minimum number of elements to remove.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify all contiguous subarrays of the same elements.
2. Determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the beautiful array.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the shortest contiguous subarray starting from the first element, which is insufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
