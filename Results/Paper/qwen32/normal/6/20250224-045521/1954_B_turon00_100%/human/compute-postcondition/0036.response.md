The code snippet assigns the value of `n` to a new variable `ans`. The values of other variables (`_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `tmp` is the first element of `a`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is equal to `n`**
