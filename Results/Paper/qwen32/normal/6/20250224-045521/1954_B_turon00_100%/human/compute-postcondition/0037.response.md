To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n):`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Let's analyze the given state before the loop starts:
- `_` is incremented by 1; (This variable is not relevant to the loop head and can be ignored for this task.)
- `n` is an input integer;
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input;
- `tmp` is the first element of `a`;
- `cnt` is 0;
- `ans` is equal to `n`;

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0 when the loop starts. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` before the loop starts because it will be set to 0 when the loop begins.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
