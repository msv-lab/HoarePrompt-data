The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the variable `a` will now hold the list of integers provided in the input, and the other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input.**
