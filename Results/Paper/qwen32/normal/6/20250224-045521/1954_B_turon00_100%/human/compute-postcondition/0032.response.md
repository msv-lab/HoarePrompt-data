The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but since no specific value or operation is provided for `_`, we can assume that its incremented value is still not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `_` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer**.
