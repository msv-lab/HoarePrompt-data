The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The initial state does not specify the values of `ans` and `cnt`, so we cannot determine their exact values after the execution. However, we can describe the change in `ans` based on the operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
