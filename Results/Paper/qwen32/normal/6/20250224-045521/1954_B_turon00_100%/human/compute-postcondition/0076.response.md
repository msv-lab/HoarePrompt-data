Output State: **`n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cnt` is increased by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` are subject to the precondition that `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` after `i` has been incremented by 1.
