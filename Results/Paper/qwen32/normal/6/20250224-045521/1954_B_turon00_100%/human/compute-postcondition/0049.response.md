The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1` and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again, making it `i + 2` (since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the last iteration). `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`**
