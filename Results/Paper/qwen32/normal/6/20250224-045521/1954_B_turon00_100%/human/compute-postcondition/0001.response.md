The only object in the loop head of the provided for loop is the underscore `_` and the variable `t`. The underscore `_` is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not going to be used inside the loop body. Therefore, the only variable we need to consider adjusting is `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, as the range function `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state, `t` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, which means `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

The variables `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
