### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Logic to Determine Minimum Removals:**
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and `cnt` to count the consecutive occurrences of `tmp`.
   - It iterates through the array. If the current element is equal to `tmp`, it increments `cnt`. Otherwise, it updates `ans` (which tracks the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the same elements) and resets `cnt`.
   - After the loop, it ensures `ans` is updated with the last counted sequence.
   - If `n == 1` or if `ans == n` (meaning all elements are the same), it outputs `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `ans`, which represents the length of the shortest contiguous subarray of the same elements.

3. **Problem Requirements:**
   - The program needs to identify the shortest contiguous subarray of the same elements and determine if removing this subarray would make the array non-beautiful.
   - If the array consists of only one type of element or has a length of 1, it should output `-1` because it cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - The program correctly identifies the shortest subarray and determines if its removal would make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. It handles the edge cases as specified in the problem statement.
