The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and then stores them in a list named `nums`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers converted from the input line.**
