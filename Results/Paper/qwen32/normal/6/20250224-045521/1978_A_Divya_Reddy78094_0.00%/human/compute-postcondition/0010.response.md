Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500. The value of `t` is then decreased by 1.
- `n` is the next input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

Explanation:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. This means that `nums[0]` is the largest integer in the list, and `nums[1]` is the second largest integer in the list.
- The `print` statement calculates the sum of the first two elements of the list `nums` (i.e., `nums[0] + nums[1]`).

Since the exact values of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these elements:

Output: **the sum of the two largest integers in the list `nums` (where `nums[0]` is the largest integer and `nums[1]` is the second largest integer in the list)**
