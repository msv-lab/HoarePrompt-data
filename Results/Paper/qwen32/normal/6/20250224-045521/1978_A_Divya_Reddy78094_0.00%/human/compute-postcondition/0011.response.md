The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since `t` is decreased by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500, now `t` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
