To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500. However, its value is not directly relevant to the print statement.
- `n` is a new input integer, but its value is not directly relevant to the print statement either.
- `nums` is a list of integers that is sorted in descending order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

### Analysis:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `nums[0]` is the first element of the list, which is the largest element because the list is sorted in descending order.
- `nums[1]` is the second element of the list, which is the second largest element because the list is sorted in descending order.
- The print statement adds the first and second elements of the list and prints the result.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the sum of the two largest numbers in the `nums` list.

### Final Output:
Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest element and nums[1] is the second largest element in the sorted list `nums`)**

However, since we can provide a more precise numerical answer based on the sorted nature of the list, we can state:

Output: **the sum of the two largest numbers in the sorted list `nums`**
