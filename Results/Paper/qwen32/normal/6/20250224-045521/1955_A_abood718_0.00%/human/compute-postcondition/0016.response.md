To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input.
- The input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces.

Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

Explanation:
- We need to compute the value of the expression `int(A * C / 2)`.
- `A` and `C` are integers, so `A * C` will be the product of these two integers.
- The division by 2 will result in a floating-point number unless the product `A * C` is already even, in which case it will be an integer.
- The `int()` function will convert the result to an integer, effectively performing a floor division if the result of `A * C / 2` is not already an integer.

Therefore, the output will be the integer part of the division of the product of `A` and `C` by 2.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are the first and third integers from the input respectively)**
