Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, where the input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces. `i` is incremented by 1. If `B * 2 < C`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the state remains unchanged. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**

Natural Language: The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are set to the three positive integers provided as input. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions regarding `B * 2 < C` and whether `A` is even or odd remain unchanged, except that if `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.
