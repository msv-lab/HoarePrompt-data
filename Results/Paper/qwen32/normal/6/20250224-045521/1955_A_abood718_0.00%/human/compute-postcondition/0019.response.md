To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how it affects the variables in the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input. The input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces.
- `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Value of `X`:**
   - `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.
   - For example, if `A` is 10, then `X` would be `10 // 2`, which equals 5.

2. **Calculate the Expression `X * C + B`:**
   - The expression `X * C + B` involves multiplying `X` by `C` and then adding `B`.
   - Using the example where `A` is 10, `X` is 5, and assuming `C` is 3 and `B` is 4, the calculation would be:
     \[
     X * C + B = 5 * 3 + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19
     \]

3. **Generalize the Output:**
   - The output will be the result of the expression `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.
   - Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not specified, we can generalize the output as `X * C + B` with `X` being `A // 2`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

Output: **X * C + B (where X is A // 2)**
