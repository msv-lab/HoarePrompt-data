The value of `X` is assigned the result of integer division of `A` by 2. The values of `B` and `C` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, where the input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces; `X` is equal to `A // 2`.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, where the input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces; `X` is equal to `A // 2`.**
