Output State: **`A` is an odd integer, `B` is an integer, `C` is an integer, `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, `X` is `A // 2`.**

In simple terms, `A`, `B`, and `C` retain their initial values with the additional constraint that `B * 2` is at least `C`. The new variable `X` is assigned the integer division of `A` by 2.
