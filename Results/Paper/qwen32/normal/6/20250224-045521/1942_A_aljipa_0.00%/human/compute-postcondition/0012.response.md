Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t` (This variable `t` is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `k` is the second integer from the new input.
- `res` is defined conditionally:
  - If `k == n`, then `res` is `[1] * n` (a list of `n` ones).
  - If `k == 1`, then `res` is `range(n)` (a range object from 0 to `n-1`).
  - Otherwise, `res` is `[-1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*res)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(*res)` statement will unpack the `res` list or range and print its elements separated by spaces.

#### Case 1: `k == n`
- `res` is `[1] * n`, which is a list of `n` ones.
- The output will be `n` ones separated by spaces.

#### Case 2: `k == 1`
- `res` is `range(n)`, which is a range object from 0 to `n-1`.
- The output will be numbers from 0 to `n-1` separated by spaces.

#### Case 3: `k != 1` and `k != n`
- `res` is `[-1]`.
- The output will be `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The output will depend on the values of `n` and `k`:
- If `k == n`, the output will be `n` ones.
- If `k == 1`, the output will be numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n ones (if k == n), numbers from 0 to n-1 (if k == 1), or -1 (otherwise)**
