Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by constructing an array `a` for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`. However, the logic used to determine the array `a` is incorrect for several cases. Let's analyze the logic:

1. If `k == n`, the program outputs an array of `n` ones. This is correct because all cyclic shifts of an array of identical elements are sorted.
2. If `k == 1`, the program outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. This is incorrect because only the cyclic shift starting with the smallest element (which is the first element in this case) will be sorted, and the other shifts will not be sorted. For example, if `n = 3`, the array `[0, 1, 2]` will have only one sorted cyclic shift: `[0, 1, 2]`, but the other shifts `[1, 2, 0]` and `[2, 0, 1]` are not sorted.
3. If `k` is neither `n` nor `1`, the program outputs `-1`. This is incorrect because there are cases where `1 < k < n` for which a valid array exists. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]`, which has two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[2, 1, 1]`.

Since the program does not correctly handle cases where `1 < k < n`, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
