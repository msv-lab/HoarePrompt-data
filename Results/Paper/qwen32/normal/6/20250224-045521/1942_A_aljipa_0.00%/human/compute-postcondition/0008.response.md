Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Recap
1. `t` is `t - 1` (This doesn't affect the value of `res` directly).
2. `n` is the first integer from the new input.
3. `k` is the second integer from the new input.
4. `res` is defined based on the value of `k`:
   - If `k == n`, `res` is `[1] * n` (a list of `n` ones).
   - If `k == 1`, `res` is `range(n)` (a range object from 0 to `n-1`).
   - Otherwise, `res` is `[-1]` (a list containing a single -1).

### Code Snippet
```python
print(*res)
```
The `*` operator is used to unpack the elements of the `res` list or range object, and then they are printed separated by spaces.

### Analysis of `res`
- **Case 1: `k == n`**
  - `res` becomes `[1] * n`, which is a list containing `n` ones.
  - Example: If `n = 5`, `res` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - When printed, it will show: `1 1 1 1 1`.

- **Case 2: `k == 1`**
  - `res` becomes `range(n)`, which is a range object from `0` to `n-1`.
  - Example: If `n = 5`, `res` will be `range(0, 5)`, which when unpacked and printed, will show: `0 1 2 3 4`.

- **Case 3: Otherwise**
  - `res` becomes `[-1]`, a list containing a single -1.
  - When printed, it will show: `-1`.

### Conclusion
The output of the `print(*res)` statement depends on the value of `k` relative to `n`.

- If `k == n`, the output will be a sequence of `n` ones.
- If `k == 1`, the output will be a sequence of integers from `0` to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `-1`.

### Final Output
Given the conditions, the final output is described as follows:

Output: **`1 1 1 ... 1` (n times) if `k == n`, `0 1 2 ... n-1` if `k == 1`, `-1` otherwise**
