The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n`, `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`**
