Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for the problem. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Case k == n**:
   - The program correctly outputs an array of `n` ones, which will have all `n` cyclic shifts sorted. This is because all elements are equal, and thus any cyclic shift is sorted.

2. **Case k == 1**:
   - The program outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. While this array does have exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the first one), the problem specifies that the elements of the array should be between 1 and \(10^9\). The program should output a valid array within this range. For example, `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` would be a correct output.

3. **Case k != 1 and k != n**:
   - The program outputs `-1`. While there might not always be an array that satisfies the condition for arbitrary `k`, the program should attempt to find a valid array or correctly determine when it is impossible. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `-1`, but a valid array is `[1, 2, 1]` which has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2]`.

In summary, the program does not handle the `k == 1` case correctly (elements should be between 1 and \(10^9\)), and it does not attempt to find valid arrays for other values of `k` other than `k == 1` or `k == n`. Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases described in the problem statement.
