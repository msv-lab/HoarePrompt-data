The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **NO**
