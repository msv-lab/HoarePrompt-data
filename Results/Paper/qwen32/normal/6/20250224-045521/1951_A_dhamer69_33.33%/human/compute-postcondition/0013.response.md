The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('NO')`. This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` to the console. The values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `count_1` mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string to be printed is explicitly defined as `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
