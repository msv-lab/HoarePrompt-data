Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` takes an input from the user and `int()` converts it to an integer. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
