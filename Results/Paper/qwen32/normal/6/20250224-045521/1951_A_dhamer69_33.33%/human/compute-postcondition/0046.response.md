Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
   - `t` is set to 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `s` is a new value provided by the user input.
   - If `n` is equal to 2:
     - `s` remains '00' if it was '00'.
     - Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'.
   - If `n` is not equal to 2:
     - `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` and is either odd or even.
     - The count of '11' in `s` is either 1 or not equal to 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

### Code Execution Analysis:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.
- The value of `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, or `s`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, or `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
