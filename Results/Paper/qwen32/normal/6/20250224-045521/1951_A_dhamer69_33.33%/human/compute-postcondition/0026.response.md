The given `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

### Explanation:
- The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `count_1`) and their conditions, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
