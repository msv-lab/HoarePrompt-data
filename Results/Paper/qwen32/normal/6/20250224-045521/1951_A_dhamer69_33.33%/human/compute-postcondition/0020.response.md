Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2; `s` is the value of the user input; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, then `count_1` remains odd. Otherwise, `count_1` is even and the count of '11' in `s` is either 1 or not equal to 1.**
