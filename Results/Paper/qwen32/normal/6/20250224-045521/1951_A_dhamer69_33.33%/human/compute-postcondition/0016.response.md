The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This output is independent of the values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `count_1`, and the count of '11' in `s` as described in the initial state. The print statement directly outputs `'NO'` without any conditional checks or manipulations of the variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
