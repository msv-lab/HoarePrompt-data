Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is a positive integer (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`); `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the user input. If `n` is equal to 2, then if `s` is equal to '00', `s` remains '00', otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, it remains odd, otherwise, it is even and the count of '11' in `s` is either 1 or not equal to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is `t - 1` (where `t` was originally greater than 0); `n` is the input integer; `s` is the new value provided by the user input. If `n` is equal to 2, then `s` remains '00' if it was '00', otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, then `count_1` is updated to the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, it remains odd, otherwise, it is even. Additionally, if `n` is not equal to 2, the count of '11' in `s` is either 1 or not equal to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 0; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the new value provided by the user input. If `n` is equal to 2, then `s` remains '00' if it was '00', otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` and is either odd or even. Additionally, if `n` is not equal to 2, the count of '11' in `s` is either 1 or not equal to 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
