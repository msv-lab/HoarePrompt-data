Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t - 1`, `s` is the input string of the last test case, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the last test case, and `b` is the integer value of the second element in the last test case. Additionally, the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even.**
