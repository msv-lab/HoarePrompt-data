Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. For each test case, there is one line containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    a = int(list(s.split())[0])
    b = int(list(s.split())[1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `a` is the integer value of the first element of the user's input `s` split into a list, `b` is the integer value of the second element of the user's input `s` split into a list, `s` is the user's input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1, `a` is the integer value of the first element of the new user's input `s` split into a list, `b` is the integer value of the second element of the user's input `s` split into a list, `s` is the new user's input, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1, `s` is the new user's input, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first word in `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
