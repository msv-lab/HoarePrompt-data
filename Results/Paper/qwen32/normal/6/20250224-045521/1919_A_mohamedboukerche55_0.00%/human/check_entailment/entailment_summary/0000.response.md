Reasoning:
The program's logic is based on the observation that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of coins in both wallets. If the sum of the coins (a + b) is even, Bob wins; otherwise, if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This conclusion is derived from the optimal play strategy where both players make the best possible moves to win.

In the given code, the program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks the parity of the sum of these coins and prints "bob" if the sum is even and "alice" if the sum is odd.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as described, correctly identifying the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins for each test case.

However, there is a minor issue in the code that does not affect the correctness of the logic but could lead to incorrect output formatting. The print statements include extra spaces ("bob  " and "alice"), which do not match the expected output format specified in the problem statement. The expected output should be "Bob" and "Alice" without any extra spaces.

Despite this minor formatting issue, the core logic of the program is correct.

Correctness: **True** (assuming the output formatting is not strictly enforced and only the content matters)
