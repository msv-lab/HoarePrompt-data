Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Monocarp wants to invite friends to a party such that at least 2 of them come.
- Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`, and `p_i` are distinct and not equal to `i`.
- A friend `i` will come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive invitations.
- We need to find the minimum number of invitations to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
1. Reads `n` and the list `p` of best friends.
2. Checks if there exists any `i` such that `p[p[i]] == i`.
3. If such an `i` exists, it prints `2` and exits.
4. If no such `i` exists, it prints `3`.

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads `n` and the list `p`.
- It checks if there exists an `i` such that `p[p[i]] == i`.
- If found, it prints `2` and exits.
- Otherwise, it prints `3`.

### Evaluation:
#### Case 1: `p[p[i]] == i`
This correctly identifies pairs of friends who are best friends with each other. If such a pair exists, sending invitations to these two friends is indeed sufficient to have at least two friends attend the party. The program correctly handles this scenario.

#### Case 2: No `p[p[i]] == i`
The program assumes that if no such pair exists, the answer is always `3`. However, this assumption is incorrect. Consider the following counterexample:

**Example:**
```
n = 4
p = [2, 3, 4, 1]
```
- Here, there are no pairs of friends who are best friends with each other (`p[p[i]] != i` for all `i`).
- However, if Monocarp invites friends `1`, `2`, and `3`, friends `1` and `2` will attend the party because:
  - Friend `1` has an invitation and `p[1] = 2` also has an invitation.
  - Friend `2` has an invitation and `p[2] = 3` also has an invitation.
  - Friend `3` does not have an invitation, and `p[3] = 4` does not have an invitation.
- Thus, the minimum number of invitations needed is `3`, but there might be cases where fewer than three invitations are sufficient.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program incorrectly assumes the answer is always `3` if no such pair exists. The program does not consider cases where inviting fewer than three friends might still result in at least two friends attending the party.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct for all possible inputs.

**Final: False**
