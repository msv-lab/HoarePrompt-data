Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and `find`, which is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation. The function returns a list containing two string elements: the first element is the string representation of `l + 1` (where `l` is the index of `find` in the array), and the second element is the string representation of `array.index(find) + 1`.**
