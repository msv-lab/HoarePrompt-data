To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables `l` and `r` in the loop head. The loop condition is `l <= r`, so for the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.

Given the conditions:
- If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, `l` is set to 0 and `r` is set to `mid - 1`.
- If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, `l` is set to `((n - 1) // 2) + 1` and `r` is set to `n - 1`.
- `mid` remains `(n - 1) // 2` in both cases.

We need to ensure that after these assignments, `l <= r` holds true.

Let's analyze the two cases:

### Case 1: `array[mid] >= find`
- `l` is set to 0.
- `r` is set to `mid - 1`.

For the loop to continue, `0 <= mid - 1` must be true. This implies `mid >= 1`.

### Case 2: `array[mid] < find`
- `l` is set to `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`.
- `r` is set to `n - 1`.

For the loop to continue, `((n - 1) // 2) + 1 <= n - 1` must be true. This inequality is always satisfied for any `n >= 1` because `((n - 1) // 2)` is the integer division, which will always result in a value less than or equal to `(n - 1) / 2`.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that after the assignments, `l <= r` holds true. Given the conditions:
- If `array[mid] >= find`, we need `mid >= 1`.
- If `array[mid] < find`, no additional conditions are needed as the inequality `((n - 1) // 2) + 1 <= n - 1` is always true.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `mid >= 1` for the first case.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of the `array`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `mid` must be at least 1, `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the value of `array[mid]` relative to `find` as described in the code.**

However, since the task specifies only to adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`l` and `r`), we can simplify this to:

State: **`l` and `r` are adjusted based on the value of `array[mid]` relative to `find` as described in the code, ensuring `l <= r` holds true.**
