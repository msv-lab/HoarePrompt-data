Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by performing at most two swaps to prepare the permutation for a binary search that will correctly identify the position of the target number `x`. However, the logic implemented in `func_1` does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Binary Search Implementation:** The binary search implementation within `func_1` is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The binary search in the problem description does not find the exact position of `x` but rather uses a modified version of binary search to ensure that after the search, the element at position `l` is `x`. The provided function does not achieve this; instead, it finds the first element that is greater than or equal to `x` and suggests a swap to bring `x` to that position, which is not the intended behavior.

2. **Swapping Logic:** The logic for determining the swaps is incorrect. The function suggests a swap only if the position `l` found by the binary search does not match the index of `x` in the array. However, this does not guarantee that after the swap, the binary search will correctly identify `x` at position `l`. The problem requires that after the swaps and the binary search, `p_l` should be `x`.

3. **Output Format:** The function is supposed to return a list of strings representing the operations to perform. However, it prints the number of operations directly and returns the indices, which is not the expected output format according to the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:** The function does not handle cases where `x` is not present in the array, which is not a concern in this problem since `x` is guaranteed to be in the permutation. However, even in the presence of valid inputs, the function does not ensure the correct outcome of the binary search.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to perform the necessary swaps to ensure that after the binary search, the element at position `l` is `x`.

Correctness: **False**
