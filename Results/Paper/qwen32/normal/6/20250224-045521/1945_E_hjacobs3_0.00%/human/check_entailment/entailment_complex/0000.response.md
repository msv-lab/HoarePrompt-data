Reasoning:  
The program is intended to perform binary search on a permutation of numbers to find the position of a given number `x`. However, the provided code does not actually implement the binary search correctly in the context of the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not ensure that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x`. The binary search part of the code is implemented, but the logic to determine the necessary swaps is flawed.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search loop is implemented correctly in terms of finding the smallest index `l` where `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `x`. However, this alone does not guarantee that `array[l]` will be equal to `x` after the binary search.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The logic to determine the swaps is incorrect. The code checks if `l` is equal to the index of `x` in the array. If not, it performs a single swap between `l` and the index of `x`. This is not sufficient to guarantee that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search will find `x` at the position `l`.

3. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` is expected to return the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped. However, the code does not correctly determine the swaps needed and simply checks if `l` is the index of `x`. If not, it performs a single swap and returns the indices. This does not align with the problem's requirement to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure `array[l]` equals `x`.

To fix the program, a more robust approach is needed to determine the swaps required to make `array[l]` equal to `x` after performing at most 2 swaps. This would involve strategically choosing the swaps based on the positions of `x` and the elements at positions `l` and `r`.

Correctness: **False**
