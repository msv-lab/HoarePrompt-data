Reasoning:  
The provided code is attempting to solve the problem by using a binary search algorithm on a permutation array. However, the code contains a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` and the subsequent assignments to `r` and `l` are not correctly implemented to find the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`. The correct conditions should be:
   - If `array[mid] < find`, then `l = mid + 1`
   - If `array[mid] >= find`, then `r = mid - 1`
   This ensures that after the loop, `l` will be the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`.

2. **Incorrect Swap Logic**: The code attempts to swap elements to make `array[l]` equal to `find` after the binary search. However, the logic for swapping is incorrect. The code checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array. If they are not equal, it swaps the elements at `l` and the index of `find`. This approach does not guarantee that after performing at most two swaps, the binary search will correctly identify `find`.

3. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of strings representing the operations, but the current implementation directly prints the number of operations and the indices to be swapped. This does not match the expected output format, which requires the function to return the operations instead of printing them.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
