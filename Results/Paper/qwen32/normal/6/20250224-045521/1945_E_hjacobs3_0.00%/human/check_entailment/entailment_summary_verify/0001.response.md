### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program in detail and compare it with the problem requirements and the provided function summary.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search should find the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= x`. The loop should continue until `r - l = 1`.
2. **Swapping Operations**: Up to 2 swaps can be performed to ensure that after the binary search, `array[l]` is equal to `x`.
3. **Output Format**: The output should be the number of swaps followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped (1-based index).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The loop condition `while l <= r` is incorrect. It should be `while l < r` to match the binary search logic described in the problem.
   - The update logic for `l` and `r` in the binary search is incorrect. The problem specifies `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`, then `l = m` if `array[m] <= x` and `r = m` otherwise. The provided code does not match this logic.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function is supposed to return a list of strings representing the swaps needed, but it directly prints the number of swaps and the swap indices. This is inconsistent with the problem's output requirements.
   - The function does not handle the case where `x` is not found, although the problem guarantees that `x` will be in the permutation.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function suggests a single swap to bring `x` to index `l`. However, it does not consider the possibility of using up to 2 swaps as required by the problem.

#### Function Summary:
- The provided function summary describes the function's output states and return values but does not reflect the actual behavior of the function `func_1` in the code.
- The summary mentions that the function returns a list of two string elements representing the indices, but the function `func_1` directly prints the number of swaps and the swap indices.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the binary search implementation, output handling, and the logic for determining the swaps, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect based on the problem description and the provided function summary.
