The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The values of `r` and `mid` remain unchanged. The precondition `l <= r` still holds true after the update.

Output State: **`l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is adjusted based on the value of `array[mid]` relative to `find` ensuring `l <= r` holds true; `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`.**
