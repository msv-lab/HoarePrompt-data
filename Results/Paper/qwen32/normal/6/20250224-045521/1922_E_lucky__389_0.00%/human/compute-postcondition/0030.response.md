Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 - 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
