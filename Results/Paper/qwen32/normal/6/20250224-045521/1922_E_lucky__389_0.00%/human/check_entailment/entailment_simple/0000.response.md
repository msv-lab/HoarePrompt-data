### Reasoning:

The given Python program attempts to solve the problem of finding an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the implementation provided is incomplete and does not correctly address the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads an integer `x` which represents the number of increasing subsequences required.

2. **Calculating Subsequence Lengths**:
   - The program tries to decompose `x-1` into a sum of powers of 2, which is used to determine the lengths of increasing subsequences.
   - The variable `subseq_lens` is supposed to store these lengths, and `mx` is supposed to track the maximum length.

3. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` based on the lengths stored in `subseq_lens`.
   - It then prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` as the required array.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Decomposition**:
   - The program correctly decomposes `x-1` into powers of 2, but the way it constructs `subseq_lens` and `ansv` does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The logic for appending elements to `ansv` does not correctly reflect the required properties of the array.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `X` is not a power of 2 or a sum of distinct powers of 2. It simply breaks the loop when `i` becomes 0, which is incorrect.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of having multiple subsequences of the same length, which is crucial for constructing the array.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length and elements of `ansv`, but these might not form an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the logic and the way the array is constructed, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
