The code snippet increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 - 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, `i` is 1**.
