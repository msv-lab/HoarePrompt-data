To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `x` is 0.
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integers [3, 3, 4].
- `mx` is 4.
- `ansv` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4].

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print(len(ansv))
```

The `len` function in Python returns the number of items in an object. In this case, the object is the list `ansv`. According to the initial state, `ansv` is a list with the elements [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4].

To find the length of `ansv`, we simply count the number of elements in the list:
- The list `ansv` has 6 elements.

Thus, `len(ansv)` evaluates to 6.

Output: **6**
