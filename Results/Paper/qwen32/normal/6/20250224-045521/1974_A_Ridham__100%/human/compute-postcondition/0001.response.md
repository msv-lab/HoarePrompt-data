The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `result`. The initial state includes the integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, there are integers `x` and `y` representing the number of applications with 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons respectively. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first input integer, which is `t`.

The code snippet does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, or `n`. It only initializes the `result` list. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `result` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. `n` is assigned the value of the first input integer. `result` is an empty list.**
