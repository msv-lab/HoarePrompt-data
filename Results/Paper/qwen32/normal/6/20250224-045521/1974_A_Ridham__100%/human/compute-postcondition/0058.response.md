To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's carefully analyze the initial state provided:

- `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each of the `t` test cases.
- `n` is 0, but this variable is not used in the print statement.
- `x` and `y` are the values from the last test case, but these variables are also not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Explanation:
- `map(str, result)` converts each element in the `result` list to a string.
- `'\n'.join(...)` joins these string elements with a newline character (`\n`), effectively formatting the list elements to be printed on separate lines.

### Output:
Given that `result` is a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each test case, the output will be each of these integers printed on separate lines.

### Final Output:
Output: **Each element of the `result` list printed on a new line (where `result` is a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each test case)**

If we assume `result` has some specific values, for example, `[3, 5, 2]`, then the output would be:
```
3
5
2
```

However, based on the provided initial state without specific values for `result`, the most precise description we can give is:
Output: **Each element of the `result` list printed on a new line (where `result` is a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each test case)**
