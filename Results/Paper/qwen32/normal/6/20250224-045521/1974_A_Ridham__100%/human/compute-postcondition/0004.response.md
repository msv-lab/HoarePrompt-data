The code snippet assigns the value of `x * 1` to the variable `space_x`. Since multiplying any number by 1 does not change its value, `space_x` will be equal to `x`. The values of `t`, `y`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`.**
