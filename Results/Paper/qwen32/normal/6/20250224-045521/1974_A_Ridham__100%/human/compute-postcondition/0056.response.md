To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's review the loop and how it processes each test case:

1. **Initialization**: We start with `t` test cases and an empty list `result`.
2. **Loop Execution**: For each of the `t` test cases, the loop reads two integers `x` and `y`, calculates the space required for each type of application icon, and determines the number of screens needed to accommodate all icons.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the loop's logic for each test case:
- `x`: Number of 1x1 icons.
- `y`: Number of 2x2 icons.
- `space_x`: Total space required for 1x1 icons (`x * 1`).
- `space_y`: Total space required for 2x2 icons (`y * 4`).
- `total_space`: Sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.
- `screen_require_for_y`: Number of screens required for 2x2 icons. If `y` is even, it's `y // 2`; otherwise, it's `y // 2 + 1`.
- `remaining_cells`: Remaining cells in the screens after placing all 2x2 icons (`15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).
- If `space_x` (space for 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `screen_require_for_y` screens are sufficient, and we append `screen_require_for_y` to `result`.
- Otherwise, we calculate `extra_space` (the additional space needed for 1x1 icons beyond `remaining_cells`) and determine the number of additional screens required (`extra_screen`). This is appended to `result`.

After processing all `t` test cases, `result` will contain the number of screens required for each test case.

**Output State**: **`result` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of screens required for the corresponding test case.**

In natural language, the final output state is that `result` contains the number of screens needed for each of the `t` test cases, calculated based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons provided for each test case. Each test case's result is appended to the `result` list in the order they are processed.
