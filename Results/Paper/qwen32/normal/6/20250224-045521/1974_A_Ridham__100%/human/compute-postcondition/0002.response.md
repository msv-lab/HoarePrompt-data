The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`. The loop will execute based on the value of `n`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon.
- `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon.
- `n` is assigned the value of the first input integer.
- `result` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `result` do not affect the execution of the loop and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon, `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list**
