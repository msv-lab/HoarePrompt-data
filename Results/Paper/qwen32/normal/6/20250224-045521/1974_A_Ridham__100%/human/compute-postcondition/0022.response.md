Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list containing one element `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`. If `extra_space % 15 == 0`, then `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the `result` list now contains one element, which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables retain their initial values or calculated values as described.
