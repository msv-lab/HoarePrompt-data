### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it to the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - It calculates the total space required by `1x1` icons (`space_x = x * 1`) and `2x2` icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - It calculates the total space required (`total_space = space_y + space_x`).

3. **Screen Requirement for `2x2` Icons**:
   - It calculates the number of screens needed to place `2x2` icons (`screen_require_for_y`).
   - The logic here is correct: if `y` is even, `y // 2` screens are needed; if `y` is odd, `(y // 2) + 1` screens are needed.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - It calculates the remaining cells after placing `2x2` icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).

5. **Handling Extra Space**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all `1x1` icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), it uses the screens already calculated.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the extra space needed (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`).
   - It then calculates the number of additional screens required for the extra space. If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, `extra_space // 15` screens are needed; otherwise, `(extra_space // 15) + 1` screens are needed.
   - Finally, it sums the screens for `2x2` icons and the additional screens required for `1x1` icons.

### Example Validation:

Let's validate the program with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 - 4 = 11`
  - `space_x = 1 <= remaining_cells`
  - Result: `1` screen

- **Test Case 2**: `x = 7`, `y = 2`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 - 8 = 7`
  - `space_x = 7 > remaining_cells`
  - `extra_space = 7 - 7 = 0`
  - Result: `1` screen

- **Test Case 3**: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 2`
  - `remaining_cells = 30 - 16 = 14`
  - `space_x = 12 > remaining_cells`
  - `extra_space = 12 - 14 = -2` (not used, remaining_cells is sufficient)
  - Result: `2` screens

The program handles all the test cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case based on the given problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
