Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`.**

In this output state, the variable `total_space` has been calculated as the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. All other variables retain their initial values.
