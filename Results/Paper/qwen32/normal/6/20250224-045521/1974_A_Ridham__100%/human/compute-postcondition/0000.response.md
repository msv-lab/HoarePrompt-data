The code snippet provided only reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` from the initial state are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. `n` is assigned the value of the first input integer.**
