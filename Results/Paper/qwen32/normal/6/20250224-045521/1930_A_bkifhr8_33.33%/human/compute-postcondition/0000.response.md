Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and the precondition for the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) is still valid.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other conditions and variables (such as `n` and the list of integers) are not affected by this line of code and remain as per the initial state description.
