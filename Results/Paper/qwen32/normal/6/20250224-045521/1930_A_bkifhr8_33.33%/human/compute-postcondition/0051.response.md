Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is 1; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`; `n` must be greater than 0; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces and has a length of 2; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
