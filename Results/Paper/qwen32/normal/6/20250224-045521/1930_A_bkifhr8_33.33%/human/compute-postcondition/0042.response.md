Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is 0; `ans` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. The length of `lst` is exactly 2.**
