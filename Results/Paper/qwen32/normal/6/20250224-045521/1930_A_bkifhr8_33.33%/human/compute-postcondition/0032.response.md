To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `t`.

Here's the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`.
- `i` is \(n \times 2 - 1\) or a smaller value if the loop breaks early.
- `ans` is the sum of the minimums of each pair of elements processed from `lst`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is an input string.
- `lst` is either empty or contains exactly two elements.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop statement, we can infer that the loop will iterate `t` times, and the loop variable `i` will take values from 0 to `t-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has a value that is either \(n \times 2 - 1\) or a smaller value if the loop breaks early. However, for the loop to continue to the next iteration, `i` must be one less than its next value. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that the loop will iterate `t` times, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus one, provided that this value is less than `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `t` remains unchanged as it is the total number of iterations.

The other variables (`ans_f`, `ans`, `n`, `l`, and `lst`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `ans` is the sum of the minimums of each pair of elements processed from `lst`; `n` is an input integer; `l` is an input string; `lst` is either empty or contains exactly two elements.**
