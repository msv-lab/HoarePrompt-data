Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is 0; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`; `n` must be greater than 0; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has its first element removed and the element at index 2 removed, if it exists. Otherwise, the length of `lst` is exactly 2.**
