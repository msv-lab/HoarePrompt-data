The given code snippet is `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This means that the element at index 2 of `lst` will be removed. Let's break down the state changes:

1. Initially, `lst` has had its first element removed. 
   - If the original length of `lst` was 2, `lst` now has 1 element.
   - If the original length of `lst` was greater than 2, `lst` has had its first element and the element that was originally at index 2 removed, reducing its length by 2.

2. The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` translates to `lst.remove(lst[2])`, which means the element at index 2 of the current `lst` will be removed.

Let's consider the two scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**: The original length of `lst` was 2. After the first element was removed, `lst` has 1 element. In this case, `lst[2]` would not exist, and the code would raise an `IndexError`. However, we need to consider the precondition that the code is executed without errors, so we will assume that the original length of `lst` was greater than 2.

- **Scenario 2**: The original length of `lst` was greater than 2. After the first element and the element that was originally at index 2 were removed, `lst` has had its length reduced by 2. Now, `lst` has at least 3 elements (since the original length was greater than 2). The element at index 2 of this new `lst` will be removed.

So, if we assume the original length of `lst` was greater than 2 (which is the only valid scenario given the precondition and the code execution), the element at index 2 of the current `lst` will be removed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is 2; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` has had its first element removed and the element that was originally at index 2 removed, reducing its length by 3.**
