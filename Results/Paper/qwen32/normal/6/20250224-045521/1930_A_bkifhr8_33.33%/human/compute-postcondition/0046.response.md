To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Analysis:
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(n * 2)`, meaning the loop will iterate `n * 2` times.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0, and it remains unchanged throughout the loop.

### State Adjustment:
- Since `i` is the loop variable, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1, and `n` will remain as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is 1; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`; `n` must be greater than 0; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has its first element removed and the element at index 2 removed, if it exists. Otherwise, the length of `lst` is exactly 2.**
