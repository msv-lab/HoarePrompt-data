Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers, and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
