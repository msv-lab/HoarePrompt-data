The code provided removes the element at index 2 (which is `lst[1 * 2]`) from the list `lst`. This means the element at the third position in the list `lst` will be removed.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (unchanged).
- `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans` (unchanged).
- `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 2 (unchanged).
- `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` (unchanged).
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged).
- `l` is the newly input string (unchanged).
- `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, with the first element removed (modified).

After the removal of `lst[2]`, the list `lst` will have one less element at the third position, and all subsequent elements will shift down by one index.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 2; `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, with the first element removed and the third element removed.**
