The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, as the `range(t)` function will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it will be initialized by the `range` function during the first iteration.

Given that `t` is already constrained by the precondition (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The state of `ans_f` does not affect the execution of the loop, so it remains as an empty list.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is not yet initialized**
