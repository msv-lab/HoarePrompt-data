The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is `i`. The loop iterates from 2 to `n` inclusive. To ensure that the loop executes, `n` must be at least 2 because the loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts, the variable `t` (which represents the number of test cases) and the variables `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i` (which represent the moves) do not directly affect the execution of this particular `for` loop. The `dp` list is also not mentioned in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n` is at least 2. The state of `i` before the loop starts does not need to be specified explicitly because the loop initializes `i` to 2 at the start of its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, representing the i-th move, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, `dp` is a list with the values [1, 1]**
