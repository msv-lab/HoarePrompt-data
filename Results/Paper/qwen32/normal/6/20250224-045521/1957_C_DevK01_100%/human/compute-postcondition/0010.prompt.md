Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, representing the i-th move, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. `dp` is a list with the values [1, 1].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
    dp.pop(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, representing the i-th move, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, `dp` is a list with the values [1, (1 + 2 * (i - 1) * 1) % 17]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, representing the i-th move, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, `dp` is a list with the values [5, 9], `i` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 4, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, representing the i-th move, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, `dp` is a list with the values [9, 39], `i` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
