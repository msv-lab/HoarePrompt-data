You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the following t lines, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, an integer `x` was read such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `y` was calculated as `x - 1`, and `y` was printed. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `x` and prints `x - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program always outputs `y = x - 1` for each test case. While it is true that `gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1)` is a valid candidate for maximizing the expression, it is not necessarily the optimal solution for all values of `x`. 

To illustrate, let's consider the case when `x = 6`:
- The program outputs `y = 5`, and `gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6`.
- However, if we choose `y = 3`, then `gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6`, which is also valid.
- But if we choose `y = 4`, then `gcd(6, 4) + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6`, which is also valid.
- If we choose `y = 2`, then `gcd(6, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`, which is not as large as the previous ones.

While the program does output a valid `y` for each `x`, it does not guarantee that the output `y` will always yield the maximum possible value of `gcd(x, y) + y`. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.

A more optimal approach would involve checking different values of `y` to ensure that the maximum possible value of `gcd(x, y) + y` is achieved.
