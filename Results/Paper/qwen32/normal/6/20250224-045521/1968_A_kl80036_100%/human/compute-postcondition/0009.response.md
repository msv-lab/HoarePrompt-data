The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to `x`. The initial state mentions that `i` is incremented by 1, but the new value of `i` is not specified. The value of `x` is determined by the user input, which is then converted to an integer.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer.**
