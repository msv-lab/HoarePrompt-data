To determine the output of the given `print(y)` statement, let's break down the initial state provided:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific output.
2. `x` is the integer input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
3. `y` is defined as `x - 1`.
4. `i` is incremented by 1, but `i` is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific output.

The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y`, which is defined as `x - 1`. Given that `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `y` will be an integer between 1 and 999.

Since we do not have the specific value of `x`, we can describe the output in terms of `x`.

Output: **x - 1 (where x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000)**
