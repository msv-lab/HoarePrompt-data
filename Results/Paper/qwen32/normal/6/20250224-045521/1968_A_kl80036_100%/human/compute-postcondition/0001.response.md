The code provided assigns a new value to `x` by reading an integer input. This new value of `x` will be used for each iteration, but the initial state specifies that `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each of the `t` lines. Since the code does not affect `t` and only updates `x` in each iteration, the output state will reflect the updated value of `x` for each line of input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the following t lines, `x` is the integer input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.**
