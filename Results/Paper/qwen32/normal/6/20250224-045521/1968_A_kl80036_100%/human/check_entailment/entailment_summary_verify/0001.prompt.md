You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `x` and prints `x - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the given program to determine its correctness.

The problem requires finding an integer `y` (where `1 <= y < x`) such that the expression `\gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it simply outputs `y = x - 1`.

To verify the correctness of this approach, let's consider the properties of the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor):

1. The GCD of `x` and `y` is maximized when `y` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x`. This is because the GCD is a divisor of both `x` and `y`, and the largest possible divisor of `x` (other than `x` itself) is `x - 1` if `x` is prime, or the largest proper divisor if `x` is composite.

2. When `y = x - 1`, `\gcd(x, x - 1)` is either 1 (if `x` is even) or a small number (if `x` is odd and composite). However, the value of `y` itself is `x - 1`, which is the largest possible value for `y` under the constraint `1 <= y < x`.

3. The expression `\gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized when `y` is as large as possible because the GCD term is relatively small compared to `y` itself when `y` is close to `x`.

Given these points, the program's approach of always choosing `y = x - 1` is reasonable and will yield a correct result in terms of maximizing the expression `\gcd(x, y) + y`.

However, the problem statement specifies that if there are multiple `y` that satisfy the condition, any one of them is acceptable. While `y = x - 1` is a valid choice, it is not necessarily the only choice that maximizes the expression. For example, for `x = 6`, `y = 3` also maximizes the expression because `\gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6`, which is the same as `\gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6`.

Despite this, the problem does not require finding all possible `y` that maximize the expression, only one such `y`. Therefore, the program's approach is correct given the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
