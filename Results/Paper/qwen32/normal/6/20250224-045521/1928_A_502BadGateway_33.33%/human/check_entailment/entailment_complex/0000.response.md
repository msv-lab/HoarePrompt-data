### Reasoning:
The given program is supposed to determine if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The key insight is that this is possible if and only if at least one of the dimensions (either \(a\) or \(b\)) is even. This is because if both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle will result in smaller rectangles of size \(1 \times \text{odd}\), which can only be rearranged to form the original rectangle or its rotation.

The provided function `func_1` only checks if \(b\) is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the case where \(a\) is even. For example, a rectangle of size \(2 \times 1\) should return 'yes' because it can be cut into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles and rearranged to form a \(2 \times 1\) rectangle, which is considered the same, but it can also be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 2\) rectangle, which is different.

### Correctness:
The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if \(b\) is even, and it does not account for the possibility that \(a\) could be even, which would also allow for the formation of a different rectangle.

**Correctness: False**
