You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2

    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
    #The program returns 'yes' if b is even, otherwise 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` within the range of 1 to 10^9. It returns 'yes' if `b` is even, and 'no' if `b` is odd. The value of `a` is not used in the function's execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle by cutting the given rectangle into two and rearranging them. The current implementation only checks if one of the dimensions (`b`) is even, which is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Cutting the Rectangle**:
   - Bob can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically.
   - If he cuts it horizontally, the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles will be `(a/2, b)` and `(a/2, b)` if `a` is even.
   - If he cuts it vertically, the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles will be `(a, b/2)` and `(a, b/2)` if `b` is even.

2. **Forming Another Rectangle**:
   - The two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form another rectangle if the dimensions of the smaller rectangles allow it.
   - For example, if the original rectangle is `2x6`, cutting it vertically into two `2x3` rectangles can be rearranged to form a `4x3` rectangle.

The given program only checks if `b` is even, which is incorrect because:
- It does not consider the possibility of cutting horizontally.
- It does not correctly account for all cases where rearrangement is possible.

Let's consider a counterexample:
- For a rectangle of size `4x3`, cutting it vertically into two `4x1.5` rectangles is not possible since dimensions must be integers.
- However, cutting it horizontally into two `2x3` rectangles can be rearranged to form a `3x4` rectangle, which is different from the original `4x3` rectangle.

Thus, the program is incorrect for at least this case and possibly others.

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
4 3
```
Expected Output:
```
Yes
```
Actual Output (from the given program):
```
No
```

Hence, the program is incorrect.
