Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following t lines contains a binary string s such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5 and the sum of lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` is `[total number of 0s, total number of 1s]` and `ans` is the total score calculated based on the described logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cnt is [number of 0s in s, number of 1s in s], ans is the calculated sum based on the described logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cnt is `[zeroes, len(s) - zeroes]`, ans is the sum of contributions from each `0` and `1` based on the loop rules.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
