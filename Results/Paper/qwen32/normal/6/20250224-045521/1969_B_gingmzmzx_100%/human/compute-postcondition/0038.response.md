Output State: **`cnt` is `[1, 1]` if the previous `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` with one of the elements incremented by 1, `ans` is 0 or 1 if the previous `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string and has at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`, `c` is the next element in `s`**.

Explanation: The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` was 0, then `cnt[0]` is incremented, and if `c` was 1, then `cnt[1]` is incremented. The values of `ans`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `c` remain unchanged.
