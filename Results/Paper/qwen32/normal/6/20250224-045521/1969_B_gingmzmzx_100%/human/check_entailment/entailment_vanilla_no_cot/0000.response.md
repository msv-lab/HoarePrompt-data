Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic in the program does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts correctly and does not handle the problem requirements appropriately.

To solve the problem correctly, one needs to consider how to transform the string into a non-decreasing order with the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. The current program seems to be trying to count transitions from '1' to '0' and vice versa, but it does not calculate the cost of the required cyclic shifts accurately.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:
1. Identify the blocks of consecutive '1's and '0's.
2. Calculate the cost of shifting blocks to achieve a sorted order.
3. Sum the costs of the necessary shifts.

The provided program does not follow this approach and thus does not solve the problem correctly.
