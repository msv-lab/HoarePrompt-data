Postcondition: **`cnt` is `[2, 0]` if `c` is `0`, or `[0, 2]` if `c` is `1`. `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 when `c` is `0`; otherwise, `ans` is `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`. `n` is decremented by 1. `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 1 element. `zeroes` is the count of `0` in `s`. `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
