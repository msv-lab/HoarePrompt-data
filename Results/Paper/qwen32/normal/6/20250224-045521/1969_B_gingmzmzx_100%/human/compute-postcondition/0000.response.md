Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following t lines contains a binary string s such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5 and the sum of lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; n is an input integer.**

In this output state, the variable `n` has been assigned the value of an input integer, while the preconditions for `t` and the binary strings `s` remain unchanged.
