Output State: **`cnt` is `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]`; `ans` is `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string and has at least 1 element; `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`; `c` is the next element in `s`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
