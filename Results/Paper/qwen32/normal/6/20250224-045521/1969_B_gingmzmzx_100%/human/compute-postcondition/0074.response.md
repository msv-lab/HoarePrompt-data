Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a binary string `s`. The function processes each binary string and returns a value based on the properties of the string. The constraints are that `t` is between 1 and 10,000, and each binary string `s` has a length between 2 and 200,000. The total length of all binary strings across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.**
