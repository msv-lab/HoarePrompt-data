Initial State: `cnt` is `[1, 0]` if the previous `c` was `0`, or `[0, 1]` if the previous `c` was `1`, `ans` is `ans + zeroes` if the previous `c` was `1`, otherwise `ans` remains `0`, `n` is decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of `0` in `s`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`

The code snippet is:
```
cnt[c] += 1
```

This line of code increments the element in the list `cnt` at the index equal to the value of `c` by 1.

If `c` is `0`, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` was `[1, 0]` if the previous `c` was `0`, it will now be `[2, 0]`.

If `c` is `1`, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` was `[0, 1]` if the previous `c` was `1`, it will now be `[0, 2]`.

The values of `ans`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is `[2, 0]` if `c` is `0`, or `[0, 2]` if `c` is `1`; `ans` is `ans + zeroes` if the previous `c` was `1`, otherwise `ans` remains `0`; `n` is decremented by 1; `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 1 element; `zeroes` is the count of `0` in `s`; `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
