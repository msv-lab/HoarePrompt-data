Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer, derived from the input, `queries` is a list of integers derived from the input, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the `queries` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into strings, converting each string to an integer, and storing these integers in a list. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `operations`, `t`, and `result`) remain unchanged.
