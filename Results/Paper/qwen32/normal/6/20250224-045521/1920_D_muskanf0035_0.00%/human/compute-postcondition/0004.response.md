The code snippet provided updates the `queries` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into a list of strings, and then converting each string in that list to an integer. This means that the `queries` variable, which was initially a list of positive integers, will now be reassigned to a new list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with b being either 1 or 2 and x being a positive integer, `queries` is a list of integers derived from the input, `t` must be greater than 0.**

In natural language: The `queries` list has been updated to contain integers from the new input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
