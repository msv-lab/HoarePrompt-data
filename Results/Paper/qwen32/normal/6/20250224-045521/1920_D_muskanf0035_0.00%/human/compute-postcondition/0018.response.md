To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions**:
   - `n`: The first input integer.
   - `q`: The second input integer.
   - `operations`: A list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers `(b, x)` with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer.
   - `queries`: A list of integers.
   - `t`: This variable is mentioned as `t-1` and must be greater than 0, but it is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for determining the output.
   - `result`: The value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
   - The exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, but we know it returns a value (or values) that are stored in `result`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*result)` statement unpacks the `result` variable and prints its contents.

Given the information, we can determine that the output of the `print(*result)` statement will depend on the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. Since the function's implementation is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output based on the given context.

**Output Description**:
The `print(*result)` statement will print the values returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, the specific values printed cannot be determined. However, we can describe the output in terms of what `func_1` is supposed to return based on the given inputs.

Output: **result (where result is the value(s) returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`)**
