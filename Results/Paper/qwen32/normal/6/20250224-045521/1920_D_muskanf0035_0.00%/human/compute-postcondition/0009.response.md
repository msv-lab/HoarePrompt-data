The given code snippet reads `n` lines of input, where each line contains two integers `b` and `x`. These integers are stored in the list `operations`. The variables `n`, `q`, `queries`, `t`, and `result` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer, `queries` is a list of integers derived from the input, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.

In natural language, the output state means that `operations` has been updated to include `n` sublists of integers read from the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
