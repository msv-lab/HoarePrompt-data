To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the function `func_1` on the variables provided. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state or provided in the code snippet. Without the definition of `func_1`, we can only infer that `result` will be assigned the value returned by `func_1` when called with `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.

Given this, the only change in the state is the assignment of `result` to the output of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer, `queries` is a list of integers, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
