The provided code snippet reads `n` lines of input, where each line contains two integers, and stores these integers as sublists in the `operations` list. This means that the `operations` list will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `queries`, `t`, and `result`) are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer, derived from the input, `queries` is a list of integers derived from the input, `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
