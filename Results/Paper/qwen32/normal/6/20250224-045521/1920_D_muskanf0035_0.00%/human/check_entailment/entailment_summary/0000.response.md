Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the problem description. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

- `func_2` is responsible for reading the input, which includes the number of test cases, the number of operations and queries for each test case, the list of operations, and the list of queries. It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the results.

- `func_1` performs the operations on the array and answers the queries. It initializes an empty array and iterates through the operations. If the operation type is 1, it appends the given value to the array. If the operation type is 2, it appends the current array to itself `x` times. After all operations, it answers the queries by finding the element at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k`.

However, there is a critical issue with the implementation of `func_1`. When an operation of type 2 is performed, the current array is appended to itself `x` times using `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`. This is incorrect because it only appends the array to itself once, regardless of the value of `x`. The correct implementation should append the array to itself `x` times, which can be done using `array *= x`.

Additionally, the approach of building the entire array and then querying it might lead to performance issues due to the large possible size of the array (up to \(10^{18}\) elements). However, the problem can be solved more efficiently by keeping track of the structure of the array without explicitly building it, but this is not the focus of the correctness check based on the provided code.

Given the incorrect implementation of operation type 2 in `func_1`, the program does not meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
