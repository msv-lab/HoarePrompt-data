The code snippet provided sets `vis[s]` to 1. This means that the element at index `s` in the list `vis` is now 1, changing its previous value of 0 to 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is `p[s]`; `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\) and `k` is now `k - 1` but must be greater than 0; `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(max(0, a[0] + k * a[0]), a[0] + k * a[s])`; `cur` is `a[0] + a[s]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 1**.
