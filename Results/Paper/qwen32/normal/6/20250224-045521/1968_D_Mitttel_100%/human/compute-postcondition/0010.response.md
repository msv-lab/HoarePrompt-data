The `while` loop condition is `not vis[s] and k > 0`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `vis[s]` and `k` such that both conditions remain true.

1. **`vis[s]`**: This is a list where `vis[s]` indicates whether the element at index `s` in the list `vis` has been visited. For the loop to continue, `vis[s]` must be `0` (not visited). Since the state at the end of the previous iteration is that `vis[0]` is set to `1` and `s` is `p[0]`, we need to ensure that `s` does not point to an index that has already been visited. If `s` currently points to an index that has been visited, we need to adjust `s` to point to an index that has not been visited.

2. **`k`**: This is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\). For the loop to continue, `k` must be greater than `0`. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify that `k` has been decremented to `0`, we can assume that `k` is still greater than `0` unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Given the above points, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `s` so that `vis[s]` remains `0`. Since `vis[0]` is already `1`, `s` should be adjusted to a different index that has not been visited yet.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is an index in `p` such that `vis[s]` is 0; `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\); `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(0, cur + k * a[0])`; `cur` is `a[0]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1**
