Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) where 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, and `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is 0; `cur` is 0; `vis` is a list of n zeros.
Code of the loop:
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
    vis[s] = 1
    mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
    cur += a[s]
    k -= 1
    s = p[s]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is `p[0]`; `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\); `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(0, cur + k * a[0])`; `cur` is `a[0]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is `p[s]`; `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\) and `k` is now `k - 1`; `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(max(0, a[0] + k * a[0]), a[0] + k * a[s])`; `cur` is `a[0] + a[s]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is `p[s]`; `k` is `k - 1` but must be greater than 0; `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`; `cur` is `a[0] + 2 * a[s]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
