Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure correctness:

1. **Index Adjustment**: The program attempts to adjust the indices of the permutation and the array by subtracting 1 from each element. However, this adjustment is incorrect because the problem description assumes 1-based indexing for both the permutation and the array. The subtraction of 1 would convert the indices to 0-based, which is not what the program does correctly. The subtraction of 1 is applied to `pb` and `ps` when calling `func_1`, but not to the elements of `p` and `a`, which causes inconsistency.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` for `k` turns. However, the logic inside the function is flawed:
    - The variable `mx` is supposed to store the maximum score, but it is calculated as `cur + k * a[s]`, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to consider the cumulative score after each move and keep track of the maximum score encountered.
    - The variable `cur` accumulates the score, but it is not used correctly in the context of maximizing the score considering the remaining moves `k`.

3. **Cycle Detection**: The function `func_1` does not handle cycles in the permutation correctly. If the player enters a cycle, the score calculation should consider the maximum score achievable within the cycle for the remaining moves `k`.

To fix the program, the following changes are necessary:

- Remove the subtraction of 1 from the elements of `p` and `a`.
- Correct the logic in `func_1` to properly calculate the maximum score, taking into account cycles in the permutation.
- Ensure that the starting positions `pb` and `ps` are correctly adjusted to 0-based indexing before being passed to `func_1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    steps = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    cycle = False
    cycle_start = -1
    cycle_length = 0
    cycle_score = 0

    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        steps[s] = k
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]

        if vis[s]:
            cycle = True
            cycle_start = s
            cycle_length = steps[cycle_start] - k
            cycle_score = cur - (steps[cycle_start] - k) * a[cycle_start]
            break

    if cycle:
        mx = cur + (k // cycle_length) * cycle_score + (k % cycle_length) * a[cycle_start]
    else:
        mx = cur

    return mx

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')
```

This corrected version properly handles cycles and calculates the maximum score for each player.
