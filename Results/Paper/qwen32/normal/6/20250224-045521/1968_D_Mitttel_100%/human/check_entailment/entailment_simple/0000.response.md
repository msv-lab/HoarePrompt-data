### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and its components to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based by subtracting 1 from each element.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from position `s` with `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, `cur` to 0, and a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions.
   - The function enters a loop that continues until a position is revisited or `k` turns are used up.
   - Inside the loop, it updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
   - It adds `a[s]` to `cur` and decrements `k`.
   - It then moves to the next position `p[s]`.

3. **Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is called twice, once for Bodya's starting position and once for Sasha's starting position.
   - The scores obtained are compared, and the winner is determined based on the higher score.

### Analysis of Function `func_1`:

The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum possible score a player can achieve by either staying in the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation. However, there are a few points to consider:

- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The function correctly handles cycles in the permutation by using the `vis` list to detect revisited positions.
  - Once a position is revisited, the loop terminates, ensuring that the function does not enter an infinite loop.

- **Maximizing Score:**
  - The function calculates the maximum score by considering the score gained from the remaining turns if the player stays in the current position.
  - This is done by updating `mx` with `cur + k * a[s]`, which accounts for the potential score from the remaining turns.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles cases where `k` is very large by terminating the loop when a cycle is detected, which ensures that the function runs efficiently even for large `k`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the scores obtained by Bodya and Sasha after `k` turns. The function `func_1` efficiently calculates the maximum score for each player by considering both staying in the current position and moving to the next position in the permutation.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
