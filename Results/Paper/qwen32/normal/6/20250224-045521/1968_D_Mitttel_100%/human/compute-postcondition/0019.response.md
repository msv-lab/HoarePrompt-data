The code snippet `cur += a[s]` updates the value of `cur` by adding `a[s]` to it. 

Given the Initial State:
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `s` is `p[s]`.
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\) and `k` is now `k - 1` but must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the length of the list `p`.
- `mx` is `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`.
- `cur` is `a[0] + a[s]`.
- `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 1.

After executing `cur += a[s]`, the new value of `cur` will be `a[0] + a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `a[0] + 2 * a[s]`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is `p[s]`; `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\) and `k` is now `k - 1` but must be greater than 0; `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`; `cur` is `a[0] + 2 * a[s]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 1.**
