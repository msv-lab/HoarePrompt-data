Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, `n` is the length of the list `p`, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of n zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1.**

In simple terms, the list `vis` has its first element (at index 0) set to 1, indicating that the element at position `s` (which is 0) has been visited. All other variables remain unchanged.
