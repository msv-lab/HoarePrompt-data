The code snippet sets the value of `vis[s]` to 1. This means that the element at index `s` in the list `vis` is now marked as visited.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is an index in `p` such that `vis[s]` is 1; `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\); `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(0, cur + k * a[0])`; `cur` is `a[0]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 1.**
