The code snippet `x = s.count('map')` updates the value of `x` to the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`. The other variables `t`, `a`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the new input integer; `s` is the new input string; `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the new `s`; `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the new `s`; `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the new `s`**
