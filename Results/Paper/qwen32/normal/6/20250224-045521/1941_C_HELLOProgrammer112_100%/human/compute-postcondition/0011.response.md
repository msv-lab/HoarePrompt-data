The code snippet updates the value of `y` to the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `x`, and `z`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string; `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the new `s`; `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the new `s`; `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the new `s`.**
