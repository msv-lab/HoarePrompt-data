To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the string `s` and then compute `x + y - z`.

- `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'map' in the new string `s`.
- `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the new string `s`.
- `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in the new string `s`.

The expression `x + y - z` accounts for the cases where 'mapie' is counted as both 'map' and 'pie'. Subtracting `z` ensures that these double-counted occurrences are corrected.

Given that the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `x + y - z`.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the string `s`, y is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the string `s`, and z is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the string `s`)**
