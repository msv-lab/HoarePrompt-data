To determine what will be printed by the `print(x + y - z)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable represents the number of test cases, but it does not directly impact the calculation of `x`, `y`, or `z` for a single test case.
- `a` is an input integer. This variable is not used in the calculation of `x`, `y`, or `z`.
- `s` is the value of the input string. This string is where we will search for the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie'.
- `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
- `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.

The expression `x + y - z` calculates the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`, and subtracts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie'. This subtraction is necessary because occurrences of 'mapie' would be counted twice if only `x + y` were considered (once for 'map' and once for 'pie').

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `s = "mapie map pie mapie"`.
  - `x` (occurrences of 'map') = 3 ('map' in "mapie", 'map' in "map", 'map' in "mapie")
  - `y` (occurrences of 'pie') = 3 ('pie' in "mapie", 'pie' in "pie", 'pie' in "mapie")
  - `z` (occurrences of 'mapie') = 2 ('mapie' in "mapie", 'mapie' in "mapie")
  - The expression `x + y - z` evaluates to `3 + 3 - 2 = 4`.

However, without the specific string `s`, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. But we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the string s, y is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the string s, and z is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the string s)**
