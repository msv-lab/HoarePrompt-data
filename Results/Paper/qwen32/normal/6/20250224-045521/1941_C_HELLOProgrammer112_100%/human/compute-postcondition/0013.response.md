To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This indicates the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not directly affect the print statement in the provided code snippet.
- `a` is an input integer. Its value is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- `s` is the new input string. The exact content of this string will determine the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.
- `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'pie' in `s`.
- `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in `s`.

### Code Analysis
The print statement is:
```
print(x + y - z)
```

This statement calculates and prints the result of the expression `x + y - z`.

### Explanation of Variables
- `x`: Counts how many times the substring 'map' appears in `s` without overlapping.
- `y`: Counts how many times the substring 'pie' appears in `s` without overlapping.
- `z`: Counts how many times the substring 'mapie' appears in `s` without overlapping.

### Calculation
The expression `x + y - z` accounts for the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`, but subtracts the number of times 'mapie' appears because 'mapie' contains both 'map' and 'pie' as substrings, and we want to avoid double-counting.

### Final Output
The output of the `print` statement will be the result of the expression `x + y - z`.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the numerical value of `x`, `y`, or `z`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `x + y - z`.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map', y is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie', and z is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the string `s`)**
