The code assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `s`. The value of `t` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the input string.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the input string.**
