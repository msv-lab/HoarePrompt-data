Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and subtracts the occurrences of "mapie", which does not correctly account for overlapping substrings or the minimum deletions required.

For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
10
pimapiepie
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Program Output:**
```
3
```

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
1. **Overlapping Substrings:** The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "pimapiepie", the program counts "map" and "pie" independently, but the deletions required to remove both substrings might be less than the sum of their counts.
2. **Incorrect Subtraction:** The subtraction of "mapie" is incorrect because it assumes that every "mapie" is counted twice, which is not necessarily true. The program does not correctly account for the fact that removing characters from one occurrence of "map" or "pie" might also affect another occurrence.

To correctly solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm that carefully considers overlapping substrings and the minimum deletions required would be needed.
