Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are equal and at least one pair of consecutive elements are different; `l` is the first index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]`; `r` is `n - 4`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list; `end` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `end` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
