You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: a series of integers, each representing the output of the loop for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of elements that can be removed from both ends of the list `a` such that the remaining list is non-empty and the first and last elements of the remaining list are not the same. If the list cannot be shortened under these conditions, it prints 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for making all elements of the array equal with the least amount of burles. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation of assigning a value `x` to a subarray from index `i` to `j`. The cost of the operation is `(j - i + 1)` burles. The task is to find the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis:
The program tries to find the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are the same and then calculates the cost based on the remaining middle part of the array. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum cost in all cases.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
```
- The longest prefix and suffix that are the same are `1` on both ends.
- The program will calculate the cost as `5 - 2 - 1 = 2` (since `l = 0` and `r = 3`).
- However, the optimal way to make all elements equal is to change the middle part `[2, 2, 1]` to `1` or `2`, which costs `3` burles.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve finding the most frequent element in the array and then determining the minimum cost to make all elements equal to that most frequent element. This can be done by considering the cost of changing segments of the array to the most frequent element.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not work correctly for all cases, as demonstrated by the counterexample. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
