Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the list of integers read from the input where `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]`; `l` is such that `l < r` and `l` is now `l + 1`; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 0; `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`.**

In simple terms, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
