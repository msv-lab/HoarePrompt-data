The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` was 1, so after the operation `st` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least two elements where `a[1] == a[2]`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 2; `end` is 0**
