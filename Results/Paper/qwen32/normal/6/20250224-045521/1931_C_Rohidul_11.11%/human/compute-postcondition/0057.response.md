Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the list of integers read from the input with `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 2] == a[n - 3]` and `a[n - 4] == a[n - 5]`; `l` is less than `n - 4`; `r` is `n - 5`; `st` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from `a[0]`; `end` is 2; `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` changes from `n - 4` to `n - 5`. All other variables remain unchanged.
