Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding

The task is to handle multiple test cases where for each test case, we have an array of integers and a series of queries. Each query specifies a subarray, and we need to find two different elements within that subarray. If such a pair exists, we return their indices; otherwise, we return -1 -1.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then reads the number of queries `q` and the queries themselves.

2. **Processing the Program:**
   - The logic inside the program is not aligned with the problem requirements. The program seems to be trying to solve a different problem or at least not the one described.
   - The program uses sets to store elements of the array and the queries, but it does not correctly handle the queries. It uses a lambda function to read integers from input but does not correctly parse the queries.
   - The logic involving `f`, `m`, `n`, and the loop does not correspond to finding different elements within a specified subarray.

3. **Output:**
   - The output part of the program is not aligned with the problem's requirements. It prints 'Y' or 'N' based on some internal logic that doesn't match the problem's requirements for printing indices or -1 -1.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem described. It appears to be solving a different problem or has a completely incorrect logic for the given problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
