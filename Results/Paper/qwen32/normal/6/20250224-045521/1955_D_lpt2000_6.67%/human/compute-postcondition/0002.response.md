Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; similarly, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `nabors` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated to the values provided by the input.**

In simple terms, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated to the integers provided by the input, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, and `nabors`) remain unchanged.
