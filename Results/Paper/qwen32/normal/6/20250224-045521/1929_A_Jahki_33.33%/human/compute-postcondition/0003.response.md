The code snippet increments the variable `order` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and the condition that `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `order` is 1; `num2` must be greater than 1. Additionally, `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.**
