Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the condition to print `0`. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and if so, it returns `True`. However, the condition in the main loop incorrectly prints `0` when `func_1(a, num2)` returns `True`. According to the problem description, the beauty of the array is `0` only when all elements are the same, not when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split()]
    if len(set(a)) == 1:  # Check if all elements are the same
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)
```

This version correctly checks if all elements in the array are the same using `len(set(a)) == 1`. If they are, it prints `0`; otherwise, it calculates the maximum beauty as described in the problem statement.
