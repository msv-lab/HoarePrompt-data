### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the logical error in the function `func_1` and the unnecessary condition `if i.isdigit()` in the list comprehension.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to check if the array is strictly increasing, but it actually checks if the array is in non-decreasing order. Even if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, the beauty of the array can still be non-zero. For example, the beauty of the array `[1, 2, 3]` is `2`, not `0`. Therefore, the condition `if func_1(a, num2): print(0)` is incorrect.
   
2. **Handling Input**:
   - The condition `if i.isdigit()` in the list comprehension is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the input consists of valid integers. This condition can lead to incorrect behavior if the input is not properly formatted, even though the problem constraints ensure that it will be.

3. **Sorting and Calculating Beauty**:
   - The part of the code that sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements is correct. However, it is not executed if the array is already sorted according to `func_1`, which is incorrect as explained above.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the program and provides a corrected version of the code. The original program is indeed incorrect due to the logical error in `func_1` and the unnecessary condition in the list comprehension.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
