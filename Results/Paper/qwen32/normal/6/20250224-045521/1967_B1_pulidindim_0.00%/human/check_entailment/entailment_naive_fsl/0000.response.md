Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.

The condition for a valid pair (a, b) is that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The provided program attempts to count such pairs but uses an incorrect approach. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Initialization of `count` and `ans`**:
   - `count` is initialized to 2, which skips the case where `b = 1`. This is incorrect because pairs like (a, 1) should be counted.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is incorrect. The initial count should be 0, and then pairs (a, 1) should be counted separately.

2. **Loop logic**:
   - The loop increments `count` and calculates `g` as `n / count`, but it does not correctly handle the gcd condition.
   - The condition `if g < countmins: break` is not appropriate for this problem.
   - The calculation `ans += g / count + 1` does not correctly count the valid pairs.

3. **Handling of `b = 1`**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `b = 1`. For any `a` from 1 to `n`, the pair (a, 1) is valid because `a + 1` is always a multiple of `1 * gcd(a, 1) = 1`.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and for each `b`, iterate over possible values of `a` from 1 to `n` to check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds. This approach would be computationally expensive for large values of `n` and `m`, so optimizations are necessary.

Here is a corrected version of the program that correctly counts the valid pairs:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version checks each pair (a, b) and counts it if it satisfies the condition. However, for large inputs, this approach would be too slow, and further optimizations would be required. But the logic is correct for counting valid pairs.
