### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`, and then iterates over possible values of `count` from 2 to `m`. The logic inside the loop is not clearly derived from the problem statement and involves calculations that do not directly relate to the problem's requirements.

#### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `count = 2`: This suggests the program is trying to consider pairs where \(b \geq 2\).
   - `ans = n`: This suggests the program is initially counting pairs where \(b = 1\). However, this initialization might be incorrect because it assumes all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid, which is not necessarily true.

2. **Loop and Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates from `count = 2` to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, `countmins = count - 1` and `g = n / count`.
   - The condition `if g < countmins` seems to be checking if `n / count` is less than `count - 1`, but this condition is not logically derived from the problem statement.
   - The subsequent calculations (`g -= countmins` and `ans += g / count + 1`) are also not derived from the problem statement and do not correctly count the number of valid pairs.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the integer value of `ans`, which is not correctly computed.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using nested loops, but since \(n\) and \(m\) can be up to \(2 \times 10^6\), a brute-force approach is not feasible. Instead, we need a more efficient approach, possibly involving mathematical insights or optimizations.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It contains logical errors in the initialization and the loop conditions, and the final output is not correctly computed.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
