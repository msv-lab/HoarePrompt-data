You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The output state after all iterations is the sequence of integers printed for each test case, where each integer is the final value of `ans` after processing the corresponding `n` and `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a specific integer value based on the given `n` and `m`, and prints this value. The final state of the program is the sequence of integers printed, one for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis
The program provided attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues.

1. **Initialization of `count` and `ans`**:
   - The program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
   - The initialization of `ans` to `n` is incorrect because it assumes that every pair \((a, 1)\) is valid, which is not necessarily true. For example, if \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 2\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1\), which is valid, but if \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 3\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1\), which is also valid. However, the program's logic for counting pairs is flawed.

2. **Loop and Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates over possible values of `count` from 2 to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1` and `g` as `n / count`.
   - The condition `if g < countmins` seems to be checking if `n / count` is less than `count - 1`, but this condition is not logically derived from the problem statement.
   - The subsequent calculation `g -= countmins` and `ans += g / count + 1` is also not derived from the problem statement and doesn't correctly count the number of valid pairs.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the integer value of `ans`, which is not correctly computed.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using nested loops, but since \(n\) and \(m\) can be up to \(2 \times 10^6\), a brute-force approach is not feasible. Instead, we need a more efficient approach, possibly involving mathematical insights or optimizations.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It contains logical errors in the initialization and the loop conditions, and the final output is not correctly computed.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
