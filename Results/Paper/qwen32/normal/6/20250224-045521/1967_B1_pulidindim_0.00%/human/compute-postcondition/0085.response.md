The value of `countmins` is updated to be `count - 1`. Given that `count` is 3, `countmins` becomes `2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` must be at least 4; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + n / 2 + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 2 - 1`**
