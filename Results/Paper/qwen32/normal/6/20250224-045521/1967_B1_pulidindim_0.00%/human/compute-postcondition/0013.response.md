Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `m` is at least 2; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - countmins) / 2 + 1`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2 - countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so `count` is now 3. All other variables retain their initial values.
