The provided code snippet does not change any of the variables except for `day`, which is explicitly set to `'AM'`. All other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'AM', `n` is greater than 0, `h` is 12, and `m` is the minute part of the input time.**
