The value of `h` is decremented by 12. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the minute part of the input time, and `h` is the hour part of the input time minus 12, with the conditions for `h` and `day` still as specified.
