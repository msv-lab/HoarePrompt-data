Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'AM', `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time minus 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time, `h` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `h` is less than or equal to 12.**

In simpler terms, the value of `h` has been reduced by 12, making it less than or equal to 12, while all other variables remain unchanged.
