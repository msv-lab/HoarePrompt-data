Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `n` is `n - 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `h` is 12, `m` remains unchanged, `day` remains unchanged based on the previous value of `h`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `h` has been set to 12, while all other variables retain their previous values.
