The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer within a specific range and that there are `t` test cases each with a string `s` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, and a variable `day` set to 'AM'. The variable `n` is newly introduced and is assigned the value of the integer input. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, the input is a string s of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format; day is 'AM'; `n` is an input integer.**
