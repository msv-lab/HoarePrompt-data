To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to break down the initial state and how the variables `h`, `m`, and `day` are derived from the input string `s` and integer `t`.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Input String `s`:** The string `s` is in the format "hh:mm", where `hh` represents the hour and `mm` represents the minute.
2. **Extracting `h` and `m`:** The code will extract the hour (`h`) and minute (`m`) from the string `s`.
3. **Adjusting `h` and Determining `day`:**
   - If `h` is 0, it is set to 12, and `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 12, `h` remains unchanged, and `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12, and `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is exactly 12, `day` is set to 'AM' (this is already covered by the previous conditions).

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume an example to illustrate the process:
- Let `s = "14:30"`.
  - Extract `h` and `m` from `s`: `h = 14`, `m = 30`.
  - Since `h` is greater than 12, adjust `h` by subtracting 12: `h = 14 - 12 = 2`.
  - Set `day` to 'PM'.
- The resulting output will be `02:30 PM`.

### General Case:

Given the format of the string "hh:mm", the hour (`h`) and minute (`m`) are extracted directly. The conditions for adjusting `h` and setting `day` are then applied based on the value of `h`.

### Final Output Description:

The print statement will output the adjusted hour and minute in the format "hh:mm" followed by the day period ('AM' or 'PM').

Output: **`{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}` (where `h` is the adjusted hour, `m` is the minute, and `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions provided)**

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, the output will be in the form described above, with `h`, `m`, and `day` determined based on the input string `s`.

Output: **`{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}` (where `h` is the adjusted hour, `m` is the minute, and `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions provided)**
