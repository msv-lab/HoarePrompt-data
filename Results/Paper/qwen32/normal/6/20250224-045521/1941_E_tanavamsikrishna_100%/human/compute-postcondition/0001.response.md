The provided Python code snippet reads `n` rows of integers from the input, where each row contains `m` integers. This means that `rows` will be a 2D list (a list of lists) with `n` sublists, and each sublist will contain `m` integers.

Given the initial state where `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the values provided by the input, the code will update the `rows` variable to hold these integer values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges such that 1 <= k <= n, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= d <= m; `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers.**
