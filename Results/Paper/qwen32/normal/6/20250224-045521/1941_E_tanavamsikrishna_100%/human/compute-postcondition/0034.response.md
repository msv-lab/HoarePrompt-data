To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head:

```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is `True`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **`heappop(min_heap)`**: This operation removes and returns the smallest element from the `min_heap`. The smallest element is a tuple `(value, index)`, where `value` is the first element and `index` is the second element.

2. **Condition**: The condition checks if the `index` (second element of the tuple) of the popped element is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given the provided state:
- `row[0]` is 1
- `row[i]` is `2*e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 2`
- `min_heap` contains elements where the second value is greater than `i - (d + 2)` including the new element `(2*e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 2, d + 1)`
- `d` is less than `len(row)`
- `i` is `d + 2`

### Analysis:
- The `min_heap` contains elements where the second value (index) is greater than `i - (d + 2)`.
- We need to ensure that the first element popped from `min_heap` has an index that satisfies the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

### Adjustment:
To guarantee that the loop executes, we need to ensure that the smallest element in `min_heap` (the one that will be popped) has an index that is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given that `i` is `d + 2`, we have:
\[ i - (d + 2) = (d + 2) - (d + 2) = 0 \]

So, the condition becomes:
\[ (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] \leq 0 \]

This means the smallest element in `min_heap` must have an index that is less than or equal to 0. Since the `min_heap` contains elements where the second value (index) is greater than `i - (d + 2)`, we need to adjust the `min_heap` to include an element with an index of 0 or less.

### State Adjustment:
- We need to add an element to `min_heap` with an index of 0 or less. For simplicity, we can add an element with index 0.

### Final State:
State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` is `2*e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 2`, `min_heap` contains elements where the second value is greater than `i - (d + 2)` including the new element `(2*e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 2, d + 1)` and an additional element `(x, 0)` where `x` is any value, `d` is less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d + 2`**
