To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop, we need to focus on the condition inside the loop head:

```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The condition depends on the values of `min_heap`, `i`, and `d`. Let's break down the condition:

1. `heappop(min_heap)` pops the smallest element from the `min_heap`. This element is a tuple `(e, (row[i], i))`.
2. The condition checks if the second element of this tuple (which is `i` from the tuple) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given the initial state:
- `row[0]` is 1.
- `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`.
- `min_heap` is `[e, (row[i], i)]`.
- `d` must be less than `len(row)`.
- `i` is `d + 1`.

Let's analyze the condition:

- The value of `i` from the tuple `(row[i], i)` that gets popped from `min_heap` should be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
- Since `i` from the tuple is the same as `i` in the condition, we need `i <= i - (d + 2)`.
- This simplifies to `0 <= -(d + 2)`, which is `0 <= -d - 2` or `d <= -2`.

However, we know that `d` must be less than `len(row)`, and typically `d` should be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the condition `d <= -2` is not feasible unless we adjust the value of `i` from the tuple to be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

To make the loop condition true, we need to ensure that the `i` value from the tuple `(row[i], i)` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given the initial state, we can adjust the `i` value from the tuple to be `d` (the smallest possible value that makes sense in the context of the loop). This means we need to adjust the `min_heap` to have a tuple `(row[d], d)`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`, `min_heap` is `[e, (row[d], d)]`, `d` must be less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d + 1`**

This ensures that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed.
