The code appends a new element to the `total_costs` list. This new element is the sum of a slice of the `costs` list, starting from the current index `i` and including `k` elements.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n.
- `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m.
- `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers.
- `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`.
- `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

After the code is executed, the `total_costs` list will have an additional element. The new element is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`, `total_costs` is a list containing two elements, the first is the sum of `costs[i-1:i-1 + k]` and the second is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
