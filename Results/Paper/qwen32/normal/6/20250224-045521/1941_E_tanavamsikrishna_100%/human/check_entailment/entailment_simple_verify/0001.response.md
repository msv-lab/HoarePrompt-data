To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and implementation of both `func_1` and `func_2` in the context of the problem description. Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotated version and the original assessment.

### Problem Recap
The task is to find the minimum cost of building `k` consecutive bridges over a river grid, where:
- The river is represented as a grid of `n` rows and `m` columns.
- Each cell `(i, j)` has a depth `a_{i,j}`.
- The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
- Supports must be placed in the first and last columns (`a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0`).
- The distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

### Function `func_1`
`func_1` calculates the minimum cost of building a bridge over a single row by ensuring that:
1. The first column has a cost of 1.
2. The first `d` columns have their costs incremented by 2.
3. A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each cell while ensuring the distance constraint.

#### Annotations and Analysis
- **Initialization**: The first `d` elements are processed correctly.
  - `row[0]` is set to 1.
  - `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is incremented by 2.
- **Min-Heap Usage**: The heap is used to maintain the minimum cost to reach each cell within a sliding window of size `d`.
  - The heap is initialized with the first `d` elements.
  - For each cell `i` from `d` to `len(row) - 1`, the heap is updated to ensure only relevant elements (those within the distance `d` from the current cell) are considered.
  - The cost for each cell `i` is updated based on the minimum cost from the heap.

#### Correctness
- The initialization and heap usage are correct.
- The sliding window mechanism ensures that the distance constraint is respected.
- The function returns the cost of building the bridge over the entire row.

### Function `func_2`
`func_2` processes the input, calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, and finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Annotations and Analysis
- **Input Reading**: The input is correctly read and processed.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost for each row is calculated using `func_1`.
- **Total Costs Calculation**: The total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows is calculated and the minimum is found.

#### Correctness
- The input reading and processing are correct.
- The cost for each row is correctly calculated using `func_1`.
- The total costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows are correctly calculated and the minimum is found.

### Edge Cases
- **Single Bridge (`k = 1`)**: The program correctly calculates the cost for a single row.
- **Multiple Bridges (`k > 1`)**: The program correctly calculates the total cost for `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum.
- **Maximum Distance (`d = m`)**: The program correctly handles the case where the maximum distance is the full width of the river.
- **Minimum Distance (`d = 1`)**: The program correctly handles the case where supports must be placed adjacent to each other.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of building `k` consecutive bridges over the river grid while adhering to the constraints.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program is correct.
