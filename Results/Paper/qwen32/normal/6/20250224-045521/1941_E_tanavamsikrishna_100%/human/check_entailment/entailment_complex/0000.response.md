### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze each function and ensure it aligns with the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Objective**: Compute the cost of installing supports for a single row under the given constraints.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Set the first element of the row to 1.
  - Increase the next `d-1` elements by 2 each.
  - Use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost within a sliding window of size `d+1` for the remaining elements.
  - Update each element based on the minimum cost in the window plus its own cost plus 1.
- **Output**: The final cost for the last element in the row.

The logic in `func_1` ensures that the constraints are met:
- A support is installed at the first and last positions.
- Supports are installed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Objective**: Compute the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Read input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  - Read the grid of depths.
  - Compute the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - Calculate the total cost for all possible configurations of `k` consecutive rows.
  - Output the minimum total cost.

The logic in `func_2` ensures that:
- It calculates the cost for each row correctly using `func_1`.
- It considers all possible configurations of `k` consecutive rows.
- It outputs the minimum total cost among these configurations.

### Conclusion:
Both functions are designed to meet the problem requirements and the provided example inputs and outputs match the expected behavior of the program. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
