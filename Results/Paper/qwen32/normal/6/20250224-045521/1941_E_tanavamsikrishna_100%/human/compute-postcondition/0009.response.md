Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`, `total_costs` is a list containing three elements, the first is the sum of `costs[i-1:i-1 + k]`, the second is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`, and the third is the sum of `costs[i+1:i+1 + k]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of `costs[i:i + k]` to the `total_costs` list. Therefore, `total_costs` now contains three elements instead of two, with the new element being the sum of the `k` consecutive elements of `costs` starting from index `i+1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
