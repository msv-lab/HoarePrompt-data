Output State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`, `min_heap` contains elements where the second value is greater than `i - (d + 2)` including the new element `e` and the newly added element `(row[i], i)`, `d` is less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d + 2`.**

Explanation: The `heappush` function adds the tuple `(row[i], i)` to the `min_heap`. The values of `row[0]`, `row[i]` (before the update), `d`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `min_heap` now includes the new element `(row[i], i)`.
