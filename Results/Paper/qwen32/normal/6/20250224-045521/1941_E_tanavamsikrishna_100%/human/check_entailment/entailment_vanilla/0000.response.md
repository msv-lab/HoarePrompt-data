Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to find the minimum cost of building `k` consecutive bridges over a river represented as a grid of depths. The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`. Supports must be placed in the first and last columns and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of building a bridge over a single row.
   - It initializes the first `d` elements of the row and uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each cell.
   - It ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed `d` by maintaining a sliding window of size `d` using the heap.
   - The function returns the cost of building the bridge over the entire row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each row using `func_1` to get the cost of building a bridge over each row, and then calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It keeps track of the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and prints this minimum cost.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Initialization and Cost Calculation**:
  - The initialization of the first `d` elements in `func_1` is correct as it sets up the initial costs for the first `d` positions.
  - The use of a min-heap to maintain the minimum cost to reach each cell while ensuring the distance constraint is a valid approach. The heap ensures that the minimum cost to reach each cell is efficiently tracked within the sliding window of size `d`.

- **Sliding Window**:
  - The sliding window mechanism using the heap ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed `d`. The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):` ensures that only relevant elements (those within the distance `d` from the current cell) are considered.

- **Total Costs Calculation**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the total costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge cases where `k = 1` (building a single bridge) and `k = n` (building bridges over all rows) correctly.
  - The constraints are respected, and the program efficiently handles the input sizes as specified.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of building `k` consecutive bridges over the river grid while adhering to the constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
