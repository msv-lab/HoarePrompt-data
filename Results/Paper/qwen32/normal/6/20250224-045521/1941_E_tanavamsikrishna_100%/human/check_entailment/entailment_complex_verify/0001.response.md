### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to find the minimum cost of building `k` consecutive bridges over a river grid. Each bridge must have supports installed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`. The cost to install a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost of building a bridge over a single row.
   - **Initialization**: Sets `row[0]` to 1 and increments `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` by 2. This seems to be an incorrect initialization. The cost for the first support should be `a_{i,1} + 1` which is `1` (since `a_{i,1} = 0`). The cost for the next supports should be `a_{i,j} + 1` for `j` from 2 to `d`. The current implementation incorrectly adds 2 to the depths.
   - **Heap Usage**: Uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each cell while ensuring the distance constraint. The heap is used to efficiently find the minimum cost within the sliding window of size `d`.
   - **Cost Calculation**: For each cell `i` from `d` to the end of the row, it updates the cost based on the smallest value in the heap that meets the condition `e[1] > i - (d + 2)`. This part seems correct in terms of logic, but the initialization issue affects the correctness.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Process the input, calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Input Reading**: Reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and then reads the grid of depths.
   - **Cost Calculation**: Uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row and stores these costs in the `costs` list.
   - **Total Costs Calculation**: Computes the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and stores these in `total_costs`.
   - **Minimum Cost**: Finds and prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

#### Correctness Analysis:

- **Initialization Issue in `func_1`**:
  - The initialization of the first `d` elements in `func_1` is incorrect. The cost for the first support should be `a_{i,1} + 1` which is `1` (since `a_{i,1} = 0`). The cost for the next supports should be `a_{i,j} + 1` for `j` from 2 to `d`. The current implementation incorrectly adds 2 to the depths, leading to incorrect cost calculations.

- **Heap Usage and Sliding Window**:
  - The use of a min-heap to maintain the minimum cost to reach each cell while ensuring the distance constraint is a valid approach. The heap ensures that the minimum cost to reach each cell is efficiently tracked within the sliding window of size `d`.

- **Total Costs Calculation**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the total costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge cases where `k = 1` (building a single bridge) and `k = n` (building bridges over all rows) correctly, but the initialization issue in `func_1` affects the correctness.

### Conclusion:
The program has a critical issue in the initialization of the first `d` elements in `func_1`. This incorrect initialization leads to incorrect cost calculations, which in turn affects the final result. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect initialization in `func_1`.
