The given code snippet adds a tuple `(row[i], i)` to the `min_heap` using the `heappush` function. This operation modifies the `min_heap` by inserting the new tuple while maintaining the heap property.

Given the initial state:
- `row[0]` is 1.
- `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`.
- `min_heap` is `[e]`.
- `d` must be less than `len(row)`.

After executing the code `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`, the `min_heap` will include the new tuple `(row[i], i)`.

Output State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`, `min_heap` is `[e, (row[i], i)]`, `d` must be less than `len(row)`**.

In natural language: The `min_heap` now includes an additional tuple `(row[i], i)`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
