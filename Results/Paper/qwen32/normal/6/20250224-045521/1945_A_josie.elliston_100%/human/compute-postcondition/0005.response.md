Given the conditions:
- `extroverts` is a non-negative integer.
- `universals` is a non-negative integer.
- If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, then the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is 3 or greater.

We need to calculate the return value of `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:
1. When `extroverts` is divisible by 3, `(extroverts + universals) / 3` will be an integer, and the ceiling of an integer is the integer itself.
2. When `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, we know that `extroverts % 3` is either 1 or 2. Since the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is 3 or greater, `universals` must make up the difference to ensure the sum is at least 3. This means that `(extroverts + universals) / 3` will be a number that, when the ceiling is applied, will always be an integer greater than or equal to 2.

Thus, the returned value will always be an integer that is the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.

Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of (extroverts + universals) / 3, which is an integer representing the smallest number greater than or equal to the division result.**
