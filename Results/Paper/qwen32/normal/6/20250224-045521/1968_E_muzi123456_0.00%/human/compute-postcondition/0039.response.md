Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` is being decremented by 1, but the exact value of `t` before this operation is not specified.
- `n` must be at least 2: This tells us that `n` is a variable with a minimum value of 2.
- `i` is 2: This sets the variable `i` to the value 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` and the `end` parameter set to a space `' '`.
- The `end` parameter in the `print` function specifies what to print at the end of the output. By default, it is a newline character (`'\n'`), but here it is explicitly set to a space, meaning the cursor will move to the right after printing `'1'` instead of moving to the next line.

### Output:
Since the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `i` directly, the output will simply be the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
