Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`.
2. `n` must be at least 2.
3. `i` is 2.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` function in Python outputs the specified message to the console.
- The `print` statement here has two arguments:
  - The first argument is the string `'1'`.
  - The second argument, `end=' '`, specifies that the string `' '` (a space) should be printed at the end of the message instead of the default newline character (`\n`).

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the string `'1'` followed by a space.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1 ** (where the space at the end indicates that a space character follows the '1')
