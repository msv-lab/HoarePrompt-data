Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`. 
   - This means `t` was initially greater than 0, and it has been decremented by 1.
2. `n` must be at least 1.
   - This means `n` is a positive integer (1 or greater).
3. `i` is `n + 1`.
   - This means `i` is the value of `n` plus 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` and the `end` parameter set to a space `' '`.
- The `end` parameter specifies what to print at the end of the `print` statement. By default, it is a newline `'\n'`, but here it is explicitly set to a space `' '`.
- This means that after printing `'1'`, the cursor will move to the next position on the same line, rather than moving to the next line.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'1'` followed by a space, without moving to a new line.

Output: **1 **
