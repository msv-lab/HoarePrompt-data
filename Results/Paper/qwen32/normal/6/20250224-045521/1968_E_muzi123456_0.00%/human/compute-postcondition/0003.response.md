The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` was an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3 for each of the `t` test cases. After executing the code, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer input provided, but `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, and `n` is the integer input provided, where 2 <= `n` <= 10^3 for each of the `t` test cases.**
