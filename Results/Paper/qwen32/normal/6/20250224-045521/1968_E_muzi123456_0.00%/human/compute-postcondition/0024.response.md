The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The value of `n` must remain at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2**
