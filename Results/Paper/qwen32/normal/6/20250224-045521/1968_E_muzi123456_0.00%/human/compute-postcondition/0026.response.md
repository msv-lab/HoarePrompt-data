Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`. This means `t` has been decremented by 1, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state.
- `n` must be at least 2. The exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state.
- `i` is 2.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(i)
```

**Explanation:**
- The variable `i` is explicitly given the value 2 in the initial state.
- The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`.

Since the value of `i` is explicitly known, we can provide a precise description of the output.

Output: **2**
