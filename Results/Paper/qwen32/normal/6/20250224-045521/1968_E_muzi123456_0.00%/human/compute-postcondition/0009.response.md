Given the initial state, the variable `i` is an integer such that \(2 \leq i \leq n\), where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\). The variable `t` is also mentioned, but it does not affect the value of `i` in this specific print statement.

The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified beyond the range \(2 \leq i \leq n\), we cannot determine a single specific numerical value for `i`. However, we can describe the value of `i` based on the given range.

Output: **i (where i is an integer such that 2 <= i <= n)**
