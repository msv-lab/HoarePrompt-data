The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (exclusive), meaning `i` should be in the range `[1, n]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means the loop has just finished executing because `i` is no longer less than `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be reset to the starting value of the loop, which is `1`, and `n` must be at least `1` to ensure the loop can run at least once.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1**
