Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `t`:**
   - The initial state mentions that `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`. This indicates that `t` was initially greater than 1 (since after decrementing by 1, it must still be greater than 0). However, the exact value of `t` is not important for determining the value of `i`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is explicitly stated to be at least 1. This means `n` can be 1, 2, 3, and so on.

3. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is defined as `n + 1`. Since `n` is at least 1, the smallest possible value for `i` is `1 + 1 = 2`. If `n` is 2, then `i` is `2 + 1 = 3`, and so on.

### Conclusion:
The value of `i` is `n + 1`, where `n` is at least 1. Therefore, `i` will be at least 2.

### Output:
Since we know `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is at least 1, the smallest possible value for `i` is 2. However, without a specific value for `n`, we can only describe `i` in terms of `n`.

Output: **i (where i is n + 1 and n is at least 1)**
