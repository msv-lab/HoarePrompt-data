Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Let's analyze the given program and find a potential edge case where it does not work as expected.

The program is supposed to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube is removed, not removed, or may be removed based on the sorting and removal process. The logic in the program has a few issues:

1. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the favorite cube could be in the position `k` after sorting. In this case, it should print "MAYBE" because the cube may or may not be removed depending on the exact order of cubes with the same value.

2. The program also does not correctly handle the scenario where the favorite cube is at the exact position `k` after sorting. It should print "MAYBE" in this case as well.

Let's consider a specific test case to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
MAYBE
```

**Explanation:**
- The favorite cube has value `3` and is at index `2`.
- After sorting, the cubes could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` or `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]` or `[4, 3, 2, 3, 3]`.
- If the sorted order is `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`, the favorite cube will be removed.
- If the sorted order is `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`, the favorite cube will not be removed.
- Therefore, the correct output is "MAYBE".

However, the given program will print "NO" for this test case because it checks the index of the favorite cube after sorting and compares it with `k-1`. If the index is greater than `k-1`, it prints "NO", which is incorrect for the case where the index is exactly `k-1`.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
