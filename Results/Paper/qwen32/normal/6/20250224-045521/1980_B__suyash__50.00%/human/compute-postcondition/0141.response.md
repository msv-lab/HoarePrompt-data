The code snippet `k -= dic[l[i]]` affects the variable `k` by subtracting the value of `dic[l[i]]` from it. Given the initial state, we know that `k` is initially `b[2]`, `dic` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `o` and values are their counts, and `l` is a sorted list of unique elements from `o` in reverse order. The value of `i` is 0, and `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`.

After executing the code, the value of `k` will be `b[2] - dic[l[0]]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is `b[2] - dic[l[0]]`, `t` is greater than the length of `l` + 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting `a`, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user's input and sorted in reverse order, `n` is `b[0]`, `f` is `b[1]`, `fav` is `o[f - 1]`, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `o` and each value is the count of occurrences of that element in `o`, `l` is a sorted list of unique elements from `o` in reverse order and must have at least one element, and `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`.**
