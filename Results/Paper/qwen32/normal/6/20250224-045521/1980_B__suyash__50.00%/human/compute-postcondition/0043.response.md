To determine what will be printed by the `print('MAYBE')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions described.

Here's a breakdown of the provided initial state:

1. **`t`**: An input integer, 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. **`i`**: Initialized to 1.
3. **`a`**: An input string.
4. **`b`**: A list of integers derived from splitting and converting `a`.
5. **`o`**: A list of substrings from a new input line, sorted in descending order.
6. **`n`**: The first element of `b`.
7. **`f`**: The second element of `b`.
8. **`k`**: The third element of `b` minus the count of occurrences of `l[i]` in `o` if `fav` is not equal to `l[i]` minus `dic[l[i]]`.
9. **`fav`**: The substring at index `f - 1` of `o`.
10. **`dic`**: A dictionary where each key is a unique substring in `o` and each value is the count of occurrences of that substring in `o`.
11. **`l`**: A list of unique substrings from `o`, sorted in descending order, and must contain at least one unique substring.
12. **Loop Condition**: The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `fav` is equal to `l[i]`.
13. **Index Condition**: The index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1` if the condition `o.index(fav) > k - 1` is true.

The `print('MAYBE')` statement is executed outside of the loop or if statement that checks if `fav` is equal to `l[i]`. Therefore, the `print('MAYBE')` statement will execute if the loop completes without breaking, or if the condition `fav != l[i]` is met and the index condition `o.index(fav) > k - 1` is true.

Since the exact values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `fav`, `dic`, and `l` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact control flow or the exact values that would lead to the `print('MAYBE')` statement executing. However, based on the given conditions, the `print('MAYBE')` statement will execute under specific conditions related to the values of `fav`, `l[i]`, and the index of `fav` in `o` relative to `k`.

Output: **MAYBE**
