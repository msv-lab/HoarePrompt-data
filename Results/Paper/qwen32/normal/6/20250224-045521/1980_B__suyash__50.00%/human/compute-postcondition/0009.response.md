Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `a`.
- `o` is a list of substrings from a new input line.
- `n` is the first element of the list `b`.
- `f` is the second element of the list `b`.
- `k` is the third element of the list `b`.
- `k` is explicitly stated to equal `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, or `k`. The string `'YES'` is a literal string and will be printed exactly as it is, regardless of the values of the other variables.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
