The code snippet `l = sorted(list(set(o)), reverse=True)` performs the following actions:
- It converts the list `o` into a set to remove any duplicate substrings.
- It then converts the set back into a list.
- This list is sorted in descending order.
- The result is assigned to the variable `l`.

The variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `fav`, and `dic` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `a`, `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line sorted in descending order, `n` is the first element of `b`, `f` is the second element of `b`, `k` is the third element of `b`. If `k` equals `n`, then `k` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables. `fav` is the substring at index `f - 1` of `o`. `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a unique substring in `o` and each value is the count of occurrences of that substring in `o`. The index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1` if the condition `o.index(fav) > k - 1` is true. `l` is a list of unique substrings from `o` sorted in descending order.**
