Postcondition: **`i` is 2; `k` is `k - dic[l[2]]`; `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `fav`, `dic`, `l` remain unchanged; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Since both the if and else parts result in the same state for the variables and the same action (breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement), the overall postcondition remains consistent regardless of whether `k < 0` is true or false.
