The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about various variables (`i`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. No variables are used within the `print` statement, so the values of `i`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, and `f` do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
