The code snippet creates a new list called `sum_values` with a length of `max(numbers) + 1` and initializes all its elements to 0. This does not affect the existing variables `t`, `numbers`, or `values`. The new list `sum_values` is introduced with all elements set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each equal to the respective input integer `n` provided by the user for each iteration; `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
