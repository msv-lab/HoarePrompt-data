The code snippet `total += i` increases the value of `total` by the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 9, `total` will be incremented by 9. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the 9th element set to 9 and all other elements initialized as per the initial state, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the `i`-th element set to `total`, `total` is increased by the value of `i`, `i` is 9, and `total` is now `total + 9`.**
