The code snippet provided modifies the value of the variable `remainder` by setting it to the integer value of `word` with its last digit removed. Given that `word` is "11", removing the last digit results in "1", and converting this to an integer gives `1`.

Therefore, the value of `remainder` is updated to `1`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, sum_total]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `word` is "11", `last` is `1`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `i` is 11**.
