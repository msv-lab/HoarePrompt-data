Let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `values` is a list containing integers from 0 to 9: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
   - `sum_values` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements from `values`: `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`
   - `total` is the sum of all elements in `values`, which is 45.
   - `n` is an integer with the value 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(sum_values[n])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `sum_values` list contains the cumulative sums of the `values` list.
   - The index `n` is 10.
   - However, in Python, list indices start at 0, and the list `sum_values` has 10 elements (indices 0 through 9).
   - Accessing `sum_values[10]` will result in an `IndexError` because the index is out of the bounds of the list.

Given the precondition and the code, attempting to access `sum_values[n]` where `n` is 10 will lead to an `IndexError`. Therefore, the code will not print anything as it will be halted by the error.

However, to strictly adhere to the format requested, we can describe the expected print output if the index were within bounds:

If `n` were 9 (which is within bounds), the output would be `sum_values[9]`, which is 45.

Since `n` is 10, the code will raise an `IndexError`. But as per the instruction to describe the output based on the given information:

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range** (if considering the error)

Or, if we hypothetically consider the closest valid index:
Output: **45 (where 45 is the last element of the sum_values list)**

Since the task asks for the precise description based on the given information, and the code will actually raise an error:

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
