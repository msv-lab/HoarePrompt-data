The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and `t`, which is the number of iterations the loop will execute. Since `_` is not used within the loop, we only need to adjust `t` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the number of remaining test cases. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1 less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 0 < `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `numbers` is a list containing the integer `n`, and `n` is an input integer.**
