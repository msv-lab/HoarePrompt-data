Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error. Specifically, the loop that populates the `values` and `sum_values` arrays runs only up to `n`, which is the maximum value in the `numbers` list. However, this `n` is not defined in the scope of that loop; it should run up to `max(numbers)`. Additionally, the loop should iterate up to the maximum `n` across all test cases, not just the last one. This means the program will fail for test cases where `n` values vary significantly between different test cases.

Here's a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
2
12
20
```

**Expected Output:**
```
51
102
```

**Actual Output:**
```
51
51
```

In the second test case, the program does not correctly compute the sum of the digits for numbers from 13 to 20 because the `values` and `sum_values` arrays are not populated for those numbers. The program only computes these values up to the maximum `n` from the first test case (which is 12), and then reuses these precomputed values for the second test case, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the `values` and `sum_values` arrays are populated up to the maximum `n` across all test cases. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `values` and `sum_values` arrays are populated up to the maximum `n` across all test cases, thus providing the correct output for each test case.
