Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, sum_total]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `word` is "11", `last` is `1`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `i` is 11

```
values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
```

Impact: The value of `values[i]` is updated to the sum of `values[last]` and `values[remainder]`. Given that `last` and `remainder` are both `1`, `values[1]` is `1`, so `values[i]` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, sum_total]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `word` is "11", `last` is `1`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `i` is 11**. The value of `values[11]` is now `2`.
