Given the initial state:

- `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
- `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`
- `total` is 45
- `n` must be at least 10

The code snippet is:
```python
print(sum_values[n])
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate `sum_values[n]`. According to the precondition, `n` must be at least 10. However, the length of `sum_values` is 10 (indices range from 0 to 9). Therefore, accessing `sum_values[n]` where `n` is at least 10 would result in an `IndexError` because the index is out of range.

Since the problem does not specify a precise value for `n` other than it being at least 10, we can only conclude that the code will raise an `IndexError`.

However, if we assume the smallest possible value for `n` which satisfies the condition `n must be at least 10`, then `n` would be 10. In this case, `sum_values[10]` would be out of bounds.

Given the precondition and the requirement to describe the output based on the provided information:

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
