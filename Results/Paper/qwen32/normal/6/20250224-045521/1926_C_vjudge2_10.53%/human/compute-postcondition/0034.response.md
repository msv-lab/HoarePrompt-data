Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, sum_total]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `word` is the string representation of `i`, `last` is the last digit of `i`, `remainder` is the integer value of `i` with its last digit removed, `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`.**

The value of `sum_values[i]` has been updated to `sum_total`. All other variables remain unchanged.
