The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `remainder` by converting the substring of `word` (excluding the last character) to an integer. Given that `word` is "12", `word[:-1]` will be "1". Converting "1" to an integer results in `1`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 47]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `word` is "12", `last` is `2`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is `47`, `i` is 12.**

In natural language: The value of `remainder` is updated to `1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
