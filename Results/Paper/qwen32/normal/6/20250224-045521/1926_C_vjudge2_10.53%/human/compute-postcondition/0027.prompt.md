Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each equal to the respective input integer `n` provided by the user for each iteration; `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0; `total` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10):
    values[i] = i
    total += i
    sum_values[i] = total


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the `i`-th element set to `i` and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the `i`-th element set to `total`, `total` is increased by the value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the 9th element set to 9 and all other elements initialized as per the initial state, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the 9th element set to `total`, `total` is increased by the value of `i`, `i` is 9, and `total` is now `total + 9`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the 9th element set to 10 and all other elements initialized as per the initial state, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the 9th element set to `total` and the 10th element set to `total + 10`, `total` is `total + 10`, `i` is 10.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
