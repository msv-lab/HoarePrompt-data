The code snippet assigns the first character of the string `num` to the variable `symb1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`; If `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; `cn` is 1; `ck` is 1; `symb1` is `num[0]`.**
