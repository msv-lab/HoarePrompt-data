The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `k + 1`, where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `j` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration**.
