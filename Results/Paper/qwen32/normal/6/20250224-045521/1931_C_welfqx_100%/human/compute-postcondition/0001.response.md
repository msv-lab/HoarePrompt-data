The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is `r`, which is the loop variable, and `t`, which is the range limit. The state of `a`, `n`, and the integers within `a` do not affect whether the loop can execute. 

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `r` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, the state of `t` is the only thing we need to adjust to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
