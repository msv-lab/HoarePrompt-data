The code assigns the first character of the string `onum` to the variable `symb2`. Given that `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb2` will now hold the last character of `num`.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`; If `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; `cn` is 1; `ck` is 1; `symb1` is `num[0]`; `symb2` is `onum[0]` (which is `num[-1]`).**
