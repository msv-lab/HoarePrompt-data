Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible cases. The logic used in the program is flawed, and it does not account for the optimal way to make all elements of the array equal by selecting the best possible range to replace with a single value.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. The program checks if the array is already uniform and if so, returns 0. This part is correct.
2. It then checks the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are uniform and calculates the cost based on that. However, this does not guarantee the minimum cost for all cases.
3. The program does not consider the possibility of using the operation to replace a middle segment of the array, which might result in a lower cost.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is required, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal segment to replace. The current implementation does not handle cases where the optimal solution involves replacing a segment that is neither a prefix nor a suffix.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
1 2 1
```
The correct answer should be 1 (replace the middle element), but the provided program will output 2.
