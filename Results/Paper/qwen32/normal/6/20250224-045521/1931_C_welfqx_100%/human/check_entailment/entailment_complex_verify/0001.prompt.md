You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: A series of integers, each representing the output for a specific test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints a single integer for each test case, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove from the list `a` to make all remaining elements the same.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum cost (in burles) to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation of assigning a value to a subarray. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray being changed.

### Program Analysis
The program goes through the following steps for each test case:
1. **Check if the array is already uniform:** 
   - It first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, the cost is `0` because no operation is needed.
2. **Check the longest prefix and suffix of the array that can be made uniform with one operation:**
   - It calculates the longest prefix (`cn`) of the array that has the same element.
   - It calculates the longest suffix (`ck`) of the array that has the same element.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it adds the lengths of these two segments, assuming that the middle part can be made uniform by changing it to the common element.
   - The cost is then calculated as `n - max(cn, ck)`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array uniform with one operation.

### Correctness Analysis
The approach taken by the program is almost correct, but it has some flaws:
- **Handling of the middle segment:** The program assumes that if the first and last elements are the same, the middle segment can be made uniform by changing it to this common element. However, this is not always the case. The middle segment might require a different element to minimize the cost.
- **Edge cases:** The program does not handle cases where the optimal solution involves changing a segment that is neither a prefix nor a suffix. For example, consider an array like `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The optimal solution would be to change the middle `2` to `1`, but the program would calculate the cost based on the longest prefix or suffix, which would be incorrect.

### Conclusion
The program does not always provide the correct answer for all possible test cases, especially when the optimal solution involves changing a segment that is neither a prefix nor a suffix. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
