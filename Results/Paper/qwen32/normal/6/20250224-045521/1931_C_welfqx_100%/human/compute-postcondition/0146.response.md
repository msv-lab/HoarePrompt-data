Postcondition: **`n` is the length of the input list `num`. `f` is 1 if all consecutive elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0; `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`; `cn` is `2 * n` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` is `n`; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the first character of `onum`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is `n`; `r` is 1. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1.**
