Output State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `n` is at least 2, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
