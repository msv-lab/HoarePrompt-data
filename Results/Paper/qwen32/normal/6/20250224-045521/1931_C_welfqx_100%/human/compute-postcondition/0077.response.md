The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. Since the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, we need to consider the condition for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. The value of `n` must be at least 3 to ensure that `j` (which is now 2) is less than `n - 1` (which would be 2), allowing the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 2**
