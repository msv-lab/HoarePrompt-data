Postcondition: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is `n`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ii` is 1. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, `ck` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
