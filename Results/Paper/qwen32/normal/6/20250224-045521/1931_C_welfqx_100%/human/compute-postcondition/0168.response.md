The code snippet provided is `cn += 1`, which means the value of `cn` is incremented by 1. However, `cn` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can infer that `cn` must have been defined somewhere before this snippet, and its value is being incremented here.

Since `cn` is not part of the initial state, we will only update `cn` in the output state. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is 1; `r` is 1; `n` is at least 2; `i` is `n - 2`; `cn` is incremented by 1.**
