Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `pergunta` is a list of integers representing the number of test cases, `a` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist contains n integers representing the a_i values for each test case, `b` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist contains n integers representing the b_i values for each test case, `n` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of people in the queue for each test case, `m` is a list of integers where each integer represents the maximum allowable final position of Kirill for each test case, and `x` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if i < m:
        pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
    x += min(a[i], b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`. `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`. If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`. `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`. `i` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and the updated `x + a[i]`. `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `i < m`, then `pergunta` is recalculated as the minimum of the original `pergunta` and the updated `x + a[i]`. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `pergunta`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
