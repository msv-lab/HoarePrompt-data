### Reasoning:

The provided code snippet is incomplete and incorrect for solving the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Function Call and Parameters:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with parameters `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`. However, the variable `pergunta` is initialized as a single float value (`float('inf')`), not a list. This is inconsistent with the comment that suggests `pergunta` is a list of integers representing the number of test cases.
   - The function `func_1` is expected to handle each test case independently, but it is being called with what seems to be aggregated data across all test cases.

2. **Logic Inside `func_1`:**
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The function is supposed to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in line. However, the current logic does not account for the fact that Kirill can bribe multiple people and that the cost depends on the specific positions he bribes.
   - The current implementation sums up the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0` and updates `pergunta` based on this sum. This does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly using a priority queue (min-heap) or dynamic programming, to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions. The algorithm should consider the cost of bribing each person and the cost of the people between the person being bribed and Kirill's current position.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
