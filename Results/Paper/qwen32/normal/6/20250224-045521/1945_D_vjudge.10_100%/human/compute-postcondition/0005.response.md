Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`. `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`. If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, `x` has been updated to its original value plus the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The value of `pergunta` remains as it was, considering the condition involving `x` and `a[i]`. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and the condition involving `i` and `m`) remain unchanged.
