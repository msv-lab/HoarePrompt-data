### Reasoning:

Let's examine the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

**Problem Analysis:**
Kirill wants to be among the first `m` people in a queue of `n` people. He can bribe people in front of him to swap places, where the cost is `a_i` to swap with the `i-th` person and `b_k` for each person `k` between the swapped positions. The goal is to find the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people.

**Program Analysis:**
The program reads multiple test cases, each with values `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. It then processes each test case by calling `func_1`. 

In `func_1`, the program:
1. Initializes `pergunta` to infinity.
2. Iterates over the list `a` and `b` from the end to the beginning.
3. For each index `i`, if `i < m`, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
4. It increments `x` by the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `pergunta`.

**Correctness Check:**
The program's logic seems flawed. The variable `x` is supposed to represent the accumulated cost to reach position `i`, but the way it is calculated and used does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. Specifically:
- The cost `x` should account for the bribes to all people between the swapped positions, not just the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- The logic for updating `pergunta` does not correctly consider the scenario where Kirill might need to swap multiple times to reach a position less than `m`.

The provided execution summary also indicates that the function processes the list `a` and `b` from the end to the beginning, which seems counterintuitive for calculating the minimum cost to reach the first `m` positions.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem based on the described logic. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
