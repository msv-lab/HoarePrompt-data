Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and the updated `x + a[i]`. `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `i < m`, then `pergunta` is recalculated as the minimum of the original `pergunta` and the updated `x + a[i]`. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `pergunta`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `x` is updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it. The value of `pergunta` is recalculated if `i` is less than `m` to be the minimum of its original value and the new value of `x + a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
