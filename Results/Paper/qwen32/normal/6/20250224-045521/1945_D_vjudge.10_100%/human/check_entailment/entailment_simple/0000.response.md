### Reasoning:

The given program is incomplete and incorrect as it stands. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position no later than `m` in the queue. However, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly implement the required algorithm.

1. **Initialization**: `pergunta` is initialized to infinity, which is correct for finding the minimum value.
2. **Loop**: The loop iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning. However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly account for the cost of bribing people and the condition to check if Kirill can move to a position less than `m`.

The current logic inside the loop adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x` for each person in the queue, which is not the correct approach. Instead, it should consider the cost of bribing each person and the additional costs for those in between.

### Correct Approach:

- **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**: Use a priority queue to keep track of the minimum cost to bribe people.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost to move Kirill to each position.

### Issues in the Provided Code:

- **Incorrect Calculation**: The current logic does not correctly compute the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position less than `m`.
- **Lack of Condition Handling**: The condition `if i < m` is not correctly implemented to calculate the cost when Kirill can move to a position less than `m`.

### Correctness:

Given the issues in the provided code, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position no later than `m` in the queue.
