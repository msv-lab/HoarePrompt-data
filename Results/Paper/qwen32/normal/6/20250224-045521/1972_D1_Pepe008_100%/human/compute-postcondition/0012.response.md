Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is `x` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is not zero, otherwise `suma` remains 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after executing the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
