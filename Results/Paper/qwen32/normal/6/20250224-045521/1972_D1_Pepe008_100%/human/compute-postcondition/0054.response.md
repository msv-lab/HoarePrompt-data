The code snippet `info = input().split()` will take an input string from the user, split it by whitespace, and assign the resulting list to the variable `info`. The values of `suma` and `t` are not affected by this code, and the condition `T must be greater than the new value of t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`suma` is 15, `t` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than the new value of `t`, `info` is a list of strings from the input**.
