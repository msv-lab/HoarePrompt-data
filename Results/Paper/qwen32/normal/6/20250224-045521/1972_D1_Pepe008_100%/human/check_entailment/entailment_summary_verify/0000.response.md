### Reasoning

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap

The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis

The code processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving \(n\) and \(m\). Here's a breakdown of the code:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Function Summary Recap

The function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`, and then outputs the result minus two.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment

1. **Condition Check**: The core condition to check is whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided code does not explicitly check this condition. Instead, it uses a derived formula to count the number of valid \(a\) values, which may not be correct or may have overlooked edge cases.
2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when \(a = 1\) or \(b = 1\), or when \(a\) and \(b\) are very large.
3. **Formula Verification**: The formula used in the code needs to be verified against the problem's condition. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent checks do not seem to directly correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Testing with Examples

Let's test the code with the provided examples to see if it produces the correct output.

#### Test Case 1
Input:
```
1
1 1
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
The code should output `1` as the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\).

#### Test Case 2
Input:
```
1
2 3
```
Expected Output:
```
3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

#### Test Case 3
Input:
```
1
3 5
```
Expected Output:
```
4
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((3, 1)\), and \((3, 3)\).

#### Test Case 4
Input:
```
1
10 8
```
Expected Output:
```
14
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), and \((10, 2)\).

#### Conclusion

Upon reviewing the code and testing with the provided examples, it seems that the code does not correctly implement the problem's condition. The derived formula and checks do not align with the requirement that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Final: **False**. The code does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and may not handle edge cases properly.
