The code snippet provided calculates a new value for `x` based on the current values of `a` and `i`. 

The updated value of `x` is calculated as: 
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]

The values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `x`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is `x` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is not zero, otherwise `suma` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**
