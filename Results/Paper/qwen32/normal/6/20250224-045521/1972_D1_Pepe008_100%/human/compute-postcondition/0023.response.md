Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus `x` plus 1. Otherwise, `suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus `x`.**
