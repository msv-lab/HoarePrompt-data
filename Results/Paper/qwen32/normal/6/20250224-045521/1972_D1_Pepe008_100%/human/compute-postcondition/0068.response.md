The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. The values of `i`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` remains the same, `x` is `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1)`, `suma` is `suma + (a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1) + 1`**

In natural language, this means that `i` has been incremented by 1, `b` has not changed, `x` is calculated as `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1)`, and `suma` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value of `suma + (a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1)`.
