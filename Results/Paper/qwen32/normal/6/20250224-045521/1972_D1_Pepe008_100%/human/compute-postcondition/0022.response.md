The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus `x` plus 1.**
