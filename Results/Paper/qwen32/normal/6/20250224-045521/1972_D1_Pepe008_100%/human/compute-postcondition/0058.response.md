To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet with respect to the initial state provided. Here's the provided code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State:
- `suma` is 0
- `t` is incremented by 1 (let's assume `t` was `n` initially, so now `t` is `n + 1`)
- `T` must be greater than the new value of `t` (so `T > n + 1`)
- `info` is a list of strings from the input
- `a` is `int(info[0])`
- `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1

Code Snippet:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its specific value. However, we can express `x` in terms of `a` and `i`.

Let's evaluate `x`:
- `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`

Since `i` is not defined, we will keep `x` in terms of `a` and `i`.

Output State:
- `suma` is 0
- `t` is `n + 1`
- `T` must be greater than `n + 1`
- `info` is a list of strings from the input
- `a` is `int(info[0])`
- `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`

Output State: **`suma` is 0, `t` is `n + 1`, `T` must be greater than `n + 1`, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**
