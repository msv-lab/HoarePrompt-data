The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `x` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, and `i`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code snippet, which they are not in this case.

Given that `x` was initially 3, it is now updated to the value calculated by the formula. The specific values of `a` and `i` are not provided, so we will express `x` in terms of `a` and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, `suma` is 4 if the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` holds, `i` is incremented by 1**.
