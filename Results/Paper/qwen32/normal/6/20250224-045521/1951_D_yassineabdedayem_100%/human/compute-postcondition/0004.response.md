The code snippet provided contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the values of `n` and `k` as integers read from the input, with the condition that `n` equals `k`. Additionally, an integer `t` is mentioned to be greater than or equal to 1, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.

Given this information, the `print` statement will execute and output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

Output: **YES**
