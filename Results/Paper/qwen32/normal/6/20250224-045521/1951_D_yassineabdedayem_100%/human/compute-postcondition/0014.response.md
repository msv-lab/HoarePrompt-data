Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the information and determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `t` is an integer input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'NO'`. This string is hardcoded and does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement outputs the string `'NO'` without any reference to the variables `n`, `k`, or `t`, the output is straightforward.

Output: **NO**
