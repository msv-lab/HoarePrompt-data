The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print(2)` statement. The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. The code will execute the `print` statement regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the variables `n`, `k`, and `t` with specific constraints.
2. The code snippet provided is `print(2)`, which directly outputs the integer `2`.
3. Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`, the output will always be `2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is `2`.

Output: **2**
