Let's analyze the provided code and initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- If `n` equals `k`, no additional changes are made.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` either holds or does not hold.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is straightforward and prints the string `'YES'`.
- The value of `n`, `k`, and `t` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string `'YES'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
