Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}. The function will be called multiple times with different values of `n` and `k`, up to 1000 times in total. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.**
