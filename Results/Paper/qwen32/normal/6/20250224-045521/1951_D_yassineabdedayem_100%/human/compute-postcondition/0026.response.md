Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- If `n` equals `k`, no additional changes are made.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` either holds or does not hold.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `'NO'` and does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement directly outputs `'NO'` without any conditional checks or calculations, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
