Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- If `n` equals `k`, no additional changes are made.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` either holds or does not hold.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`. Regardless of the conditions or values of these variables, the `print` function will output the integer `1`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(1)` statement is simply the integer `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
