Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not seem to implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The provided code contains three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`), but `func_3` is not implemented. The main logic for solving the problem should be in `func_3` or another function that is not provided.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**: The function `func_2` is supposed to find the maximum sum subarray, but it does not correctly handle the case where all elements are negative. It also does not return the correct format or value expected for further processing.

3. **Lack of Main Function**: There is no main function that ties all the logic together to read input, process each test case, and produce the correct output.

4. **Modulo Operation**: While `func_1` correctly implements the modulo operation, it is not used in the provided code.

5. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle several edge cases, such as:
   - All elements being negative.
   - The array being empty.
   - The number of operations `k` being zero.
   - Large values of `n` and `k` as specified in the problem constraints.

Given these issues, the provided code is not complete and does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness is False.
