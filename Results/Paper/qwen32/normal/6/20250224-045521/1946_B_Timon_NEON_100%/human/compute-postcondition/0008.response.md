The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. The new segment is created by concatenating the `max_segment` list with a single-element list containing `i - 1`.

Given the initial state, the value of `segments_variants` was an empty list. After executing the code, `segments_variants` will contain one element, which is the list `max_segment + [i - 1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is not an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, `i - 1`]], `max_sum` is -1, the current element `arr[i]` is less than 0, and `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`.**
