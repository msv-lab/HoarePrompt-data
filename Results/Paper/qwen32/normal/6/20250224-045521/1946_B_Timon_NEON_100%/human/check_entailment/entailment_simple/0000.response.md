### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of integers.

2. **Finding Maximum Segment Sum:**
   - The function `func_2` is called to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in `a`.
   - The logic in `func_2` appears to be an implementation of Kadane's algorithm, which is used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray efficiently.
   - The function keeps track of the maximum sum encountered (`max_segment`) and all potential segment sums (`segments_variants`).

3. **Calculating the Answer:**
   - If the maximum segment sum is negative, it is set to 0.
   - The answer is then calculated using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
     - This formula suggests that the maximum segment sum is duplicated `k` times (by multiplying by `2 ** k`), and the original sum of the array is added.
     - However, the maximum segment sum is subtracted once to avoid double-counting the initial segment sum.
   - The result is then taken modulo `10^9 + 7` using the function `func_1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The final result for each test case is printed.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Kadane's Algorithm Implementation:**
  - The implementation of Kadane's algorithm in `func_2` is flawed. The logic for updating `new_segment` and `max_segment` is incorrect.
  - Specifically, the `max_segment` should be reset when a negative number is encountered, but the current implementation incorrectly handles this.
  - The logic for appending segments to `segments_variants` is also incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

- **Formula for Answer:**
  - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is incorrect. The correct approach would be to add the maximum segment sum `k` times to the array sum, which would be `sum(a) + max_segment[0] * k`.
  - The subtraction of `max_segment[0]` is unnecessary and incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in both the implementation of Kadane's algorithm and the formula for calculating the answer, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
