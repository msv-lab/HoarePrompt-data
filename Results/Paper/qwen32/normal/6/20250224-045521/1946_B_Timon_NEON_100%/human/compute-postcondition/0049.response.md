The code snippet creates a new list `new_segment` with the first element being `arr[i]` and the second element being the value of `i`. The value of `i` is not altered in this snippet, but `new_segment` is introduced with specific values.

Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value). Therefore, `new_segment` will be a list containing the element at the index `i` of `arr` and the value of `i` itself.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]`**.
