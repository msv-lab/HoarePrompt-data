The code snippet provided resets `new_segment` to an empty list. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`) are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1, `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` (this condition's truth value is unknown as `new_segment` is now empty), `segments_variants` has not been modified, `max_segment` has not been modified, `new_segment` is an empty list.**
