The only object in the loop head is the variable `segment`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants` list. If there are more segments in the list, the loop will execute again for the next segment.

At the end of the last iteration, `segment` was `[7, 2, 4]`, and `segments_variants` contained `[[7, 2, 4], [another_segment]]`. Since the loop has just finished with the first segment, the next iteration will process the second segment in the list, which is `[another_segment]`.

State: **`arr` is [1, -2, 3, 4, -1], `new_segment` is [7, 2], `max_segment` is [7, 2], `segments_variants` is [[7, 2, 4], [another_segment]], `max_sum` is -1, `segment` is [another_segment]**
