The code snippet `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` increments the value of `new_segment[0]` by the value of `arr[i]`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_segment[0]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1, `max_segment[0]` is the original `max_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`, `new_segment[0]` is the original `new_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`.**
