Postcondition: **`arr` is [1, -2, 3, 4, -1], `new_segment` is [7, 2], `max_segment` is [7, 2], `segments_variants` is [[7, 2, 4]], `max_sum` is -1. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1, then `total_max_segment` is updated to [7, 2]. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains [-1].**
