Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` (this condition's truth value is unknown as `new_segment` is now empty), `segments_variants` has not been modified, `max_segment` has not been modified except for `max_segment[0]`, `new_segment` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The value of `max_segment[0]` is updated by adding `arr[i]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
