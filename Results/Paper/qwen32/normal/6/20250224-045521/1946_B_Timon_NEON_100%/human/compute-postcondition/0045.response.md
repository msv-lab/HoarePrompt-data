The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` adds the value of `arr[i]` to the first element of `max_segment`. This means the value of `max_segment[0]` is updated to its previous value plus `arr[i]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`. If `max_segment[0]` (updated) is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` includes a new list which is `max_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it. Otherwise, `segments_variants` has a new element added which is `new_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`. `new_segment` is an empty list. `max_segment[0]` is now `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`.**
