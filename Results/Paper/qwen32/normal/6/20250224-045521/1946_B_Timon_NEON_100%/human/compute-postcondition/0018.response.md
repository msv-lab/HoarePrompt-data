Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` becomes an empty list, `max_sum` remains -1, `max_segment[0]` is decreased by the absolute value of `arr[i]`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `max_segment` remains [0, 0] and `segments_variants` is updated to [[0, 0, `i - 1`]]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated to contain `new_segment + [i - 1]`. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.**
