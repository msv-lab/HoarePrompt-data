Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`, `segments_variants` now includes a new list which is `max_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it.**

Natural Language: The list `segments_variants` has been updated to include a new entry. This new entry is a list that consists of all the elements from `max_segment` with the value `i - 1` added to the end of it. The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is the result of the previous value of `i` incremented by 1.
