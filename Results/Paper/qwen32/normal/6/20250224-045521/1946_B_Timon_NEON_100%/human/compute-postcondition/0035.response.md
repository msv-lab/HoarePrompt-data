Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[i]` and `i`.**

Natural language: The list `arr` remains unchanged and still contains at least one element. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. A new variable `new_segment` is created and is a list containing the element at index `i` of `arr` and the value of `i` itself.
