Output State: **`arr` is [original list of integers], `new_segment` is [sum of last non-negative segment, start index] or [], `max_segment` is [max sum of any segment, start index], `segments_variants` is [[sum of segment, start index], ..., [max_segment[0], max_segment[1], len(arr) - 1], [new_segment[0], new_segment[1], len(arr) - 1]], `max_sum` is -1.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `segments_variants` has been updated to include a new entry, which is the `new_segment` with an additional element `len(arr) - 1` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
