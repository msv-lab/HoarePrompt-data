Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[i]`.**

Natural language: The value of `new_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_segment[0]` remain as described in the initial state but with `i` incremented by 1 and `max_segment[0]` updated to its previous value plus `arr[i]`.
