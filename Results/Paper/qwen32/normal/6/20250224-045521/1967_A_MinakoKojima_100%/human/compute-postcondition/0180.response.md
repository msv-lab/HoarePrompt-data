Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1. If `dif` is not 0, the behavior of `k`, `ans`, `res`, `dif`, `a`, `ans_list`, and `i` is determined by the conditions specified in the precondition: if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, and `res` is updated based on whether `k >= dif * (i + 2)` or not; if `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, `ans` is set to the first element of the sorted list `a` plus `k // (i + 2)`, and `res` is set to `n - 1`. In both cases, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `dif` is 0, `k`, `ans`, `res`, `dif`, `a`, `ans_list`, and `i` remain unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the case where `dif` is not 0 and the case where `dif` is 0.
