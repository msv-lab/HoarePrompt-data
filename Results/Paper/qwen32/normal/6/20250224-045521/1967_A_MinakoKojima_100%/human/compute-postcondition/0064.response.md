Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value it can take based on the available `k` and the differences in the list `a` plus `k // n`; `res` is adjusted by adding `k % n` to its previous value; the current value of `k` is not 0.**

In simpler terms: The value of `res` has been increased by the remainder of `k` divided by `n`. The values of `ans` and `k` remain unchanged.
