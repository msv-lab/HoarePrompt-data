Each test case consists of two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12) representing the number of cards of each type. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
