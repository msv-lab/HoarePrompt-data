Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `k` was initially 0, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as the else part does not modify any variables.**
