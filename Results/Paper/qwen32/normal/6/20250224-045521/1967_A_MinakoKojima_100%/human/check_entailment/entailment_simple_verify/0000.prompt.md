You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum score based on the problem description. Let's analyze why:

The program attempts to maximize the score by ensuring that the counts of each card type are as equal as possible, which is a reasonable approach. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `a[0]` and then incremented based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`. This approach does not correctly compute the number of permutations of length `n` that can be formed.
   - The final calculation of `ans` includes `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, which does not accurately represent the number of subarrays that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Handling of Remaining Coins (`k`)**:
   - After processing the differences, the remaining coins `k` are used to increment the counts of the most frequent card types. However, the way the remaining coins are distributed and the final score is calculated is incorrect.
   - The final score should be based on the number of complete permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` that can be formed, not just the sum of the card counts.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `k` is very large or where the initial counts of card types are already close to being equal.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 10^12`, and the initial counts are `[1, 1]`, the program might not correctly compute the maximum score because it does not consider the optimal way to distribute the `k` coins to maximize the number of permutations.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 10
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
13
```
Explanation: With 10 additional cards, we can make the counts `[4, 4, 4]`, which allows for 13 subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of `[1, 2, 3]`.

**Actual Output:**
The program will not produce `13` as the output, likely due to the incorrect logic described above.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
