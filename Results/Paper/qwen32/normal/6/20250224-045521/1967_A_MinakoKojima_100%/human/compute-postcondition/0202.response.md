The code snippet `ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)` updates the value of `ans` based on its previous value and the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Let's break down the impact of the code:
- `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`.
- `res`, `k`, `ans_list`, `a`, and `dif` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the new value of `ans` is calculated as described. The other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`ans` is the final incremented value plus `k // n` if `k` is not 0, plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)`. `res` is the remaining differences not covered by `k` plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0. `k` is 0 or the remaining amount. `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans` if `k` is not 0. `a` and `dif` remain unchanged.**
