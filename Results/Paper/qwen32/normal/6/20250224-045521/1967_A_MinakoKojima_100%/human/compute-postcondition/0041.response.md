Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`. If `k` >= `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)` and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
