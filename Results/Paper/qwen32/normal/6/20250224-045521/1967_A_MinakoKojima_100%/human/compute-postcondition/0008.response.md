The provided code snippet calculates the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` using the index `i`. However, the index `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means the code will result in an error unless `i` is defined beforehand. Since `i` is not given, we cannot determine the specific value of `dif` directly. Assuming `i` is a valid index such that `0 <= i < n-1`, we can proceed with the calculation.

Given the assumptions, the difference `dif` between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` will be calculated and stored in `dif`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` where `0 <= i < n-1`.**
