Output State: **`ans` is `ans * n - (n - 1) + res`, `res` is adjusted based on the number of non-zero `dif` values, and if `k` is not 0, `res` is further adjusted by `k % n`. `ans_list` contains the final `ans`. `n` and `a` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the current value of `res` to it. The values of `res`, `n`, and `a` remain as they were initially described, and `ans_list` still contains the final value of `ans`.
