Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value based on the differences in the list `a`, plus `k // n` if `k` was not 0, now updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` remains 0, `k` remains 0, `ans_list` contains `ans`.**

Natural Language: The variable `ans` retains its updated value, which is the maximum possible value based on the differences in the list `a`, plus `k // n` if `k` was not 0, and further updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`. The variable `res` remains 0, `k` remains 0, and a new list `ans_list` is created containing the value of `ans`.
