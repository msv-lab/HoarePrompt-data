The code snippet `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `k`, `ans`, `res`, `a`, and `ans_list` remain unchanged, and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. 

After executing `res -= 1`, the value of `res` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `res` is `res - 1`, `a` remains unchanged, `ans_list` remains unchanged, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.**
