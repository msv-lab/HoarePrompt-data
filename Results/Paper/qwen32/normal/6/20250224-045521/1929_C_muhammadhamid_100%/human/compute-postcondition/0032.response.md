To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to understand how the variable `s` is calculated using the recursive formula and the values of `a`, `k`, and `x`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s_0 = 1` (Starting value of `s`)
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `i` is set to `x`.

2. **Recursive Formula:**
   - The recursive formula used to calculate `s` is: 
     \[
     s = s_{(x-1)} + \left\lfloor \frac{s_{(x-1)}}{k - 1} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - This formula is applied `x` times starting from `s_0 = 1`.

3. **Calculation of `s`:**
   - For `x = 0`, `s` remains `s_0 = 1`.
   - For `x = 1`, `s = s_0 + \left\lfloor \frac{s_0}{k - 1} \right\rfloor + 1 = 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{1}{k - 1} \right\rfloor + 1`.
   - For `x = 2`, `s = s_1 + \left\lfloor \frac{s_1}{k - 1} \right\rfloor + 1`.
   - This continues up to `x` iterations.

4. **Comparison:**
   - The `print` statement compares `a` with the final value of `s` after `x` iterations.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints `'Yes'`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `'No'`.

### Description of Output:

Given the recursive nature of `s` and the lack of specific values for `a`, `k`, and `x`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe the output based on the final comparison:

- The code will print `'Yes'` if the input value `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `s` after `x` iterations.
- Otherwise, it will print `'No'`.

### Final Output:

Output: **'Yes' if a >= s else 'No' (where s is the final value after x iterations of the recursive formula starting from s_0 = 1)**
