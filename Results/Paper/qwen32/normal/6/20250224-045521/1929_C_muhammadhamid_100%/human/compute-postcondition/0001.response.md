The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `k`, `x`, and `a` are already integers with certain constraints, the code will update these variables to the new values provided by the input.

Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with the values provided by the input.**
