You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the values of `k` and `x`, and then checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. It outputs "Yes" if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it outputs "No".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the constraints. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not consider all possible scenarios for Sasha's betting strategy.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

The program calculates `s` by simulating a sequence of bets where Sasha loses `x` times in a row. However, the calculation of `s` does not correctly reflect the worst-case scenario for Sasha's coins. Specifically, the calculation of `s` does not account for the fact that Sasha can strategically choose his bet sizes to maximize his coins even after a series of losses.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the test case `k = 2`, `x = 2`, and `a = 1`. According to the problem description, Sasha can achieve any number of coins because he can bet 1 coin on the first try. If he loses, he can bet 1 coin again on the second try. If he wins, his coins will be 2, and he can continue to bet strategically. However, the program will output "NO" for this test case because it calculates `s` as follows:

1. `s = 1`
2. After the first loss: `s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`
3. After the second loss: `s = 3 + 3 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 7`

Since `a = 1` and `s = 7`, the program will output "NO", which is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated analysis of Sasha's betting strategy, considering the possibility of increasing bet sizes after wins and carefully managing losses to ensure that Sasha can always reach any desired number of coins.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
