The code snippet `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` modifies the value of `s`. The variables `i` and `x` are not affected by this code. `s` is updated based on its current value and the value of `k`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `s` or `k`, we can only express the new value of `s` in terms of its old value and `k`.

The new value of `s` is `s + (s // (k - 1)) + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is `s + (s // (k - 1)) + 1`**.
