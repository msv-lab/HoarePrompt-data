To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Variables and their initial states:**
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `s` is calculated differently based on the value of `k`:
     - If `k = 2`, then `s = 2^x - 1`.
     - If `k > 2`, then `s = (1 + (k - 2) * (2^x - 1))`.

2. **Condition in the print statement:**
   - The print statement checks if `a >= s`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. **Determining the value of `s`:**
   - We need to know the values of `k` and `x` to compute `s`.
   - Given the initial state, `s` is calculated as follows:
     - If `k = 2`, `s = 2^x - 1`.
     - If `k > 2`, `s = (1 + (k - 2) * (2^x - 1))`.

4. **Final print statement:**
   - The print statement evaluates `a >= s` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on this comparison.

Since the specific values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s` or determine whether `a >= s`. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **'Yes' if a >= s else 'No' (where s is 2^x - 1 if k = 2, or s is (1 + (k - 2) * (2^x - 1)) if k > 2)**
