The function `func` accepts an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, there is a distinct string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. The function processes these strings and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and `t` distinct strings of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It processes these strings and returns a result for each test case.**
