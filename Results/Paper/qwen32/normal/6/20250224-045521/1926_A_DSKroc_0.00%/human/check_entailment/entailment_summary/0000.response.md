Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw. The code correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' for each test case, but it only prints the result based on the counts from the last test case. It does not print the result for each individual test case as required by the problem statement.

The program should print the most frequent character for each string separately, not just for the last string. The current implementation does not meet this requirement.

Correctness: **False**
