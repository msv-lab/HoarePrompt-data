The code snippet increments the value of `cou` by 1. Given that `cou` is initially either 0, 1, or 2, after the execution, `cou` will be either 1, 2, or 3 respectively. The values of `arr`, `freq`, and `i` remain unchanged as per the initial state. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 2, and `cou` is either 1, 2, or 3.**
