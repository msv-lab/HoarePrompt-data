Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or just removing them (Bob).
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- We need to find the final MEX of `c` if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**: Alice wants to place numbers in `c` in such a way that the MEX is maximized. Bob wants to prevent this by removing numbers that could help Alice.
3. **Frequency Analysis**: The frequency of each number in `a` is crucial. If a number appears at least twice, it can be used by Alice to maximize the MEX. If a number appears exactly once, it might be strategically placed by Alice to maximize the MEX. If a number does not appear at all, it can be the MEX.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the MEX of the array `a` under optimal play conditions.

Here's the breakdown of the program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: It calculates the frequency of each number in `a` using a list `freq` of size `n+1`.
3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - It iterates over the `freq` list.
   - It skips numbers that appear at least twice.
   - It counts numbers that appear exactly once.
   - When it encounters a number that appears exactly once or a number that does not appear at all, it prints that number and breaks out of the loop.

### Correctness:
The program logic is flawed based on the problem's requirements. Here's why:
- **Frequency Analysis**: The program correctly calculates the frequency of each number in `a`.
- **MEX Calculation**: The program incorrectly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `a` or appears only once. However, the optimal strategy involves considering the sequence of moves and the interaction between Alice and Bob. The program does not simulate the game turns or consider the strategic placement of numbers.

### Strategic Considerations:
- **Alice's Optimal Play**: Alice should aim to place numbers in `c` such that the MEX is maximized. This involves placing numbers that are not already present or placing numbers that appear only once.
- **Bob's Optimal Play**: Bob should aim to minimize the MEX by removing numbers that could help Alice maximize the MEX.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the game turns and consider the optimal moves of both players. The provided program does not do this. Instead, it directly calculates the MEX based on the frequency of numbers, which does not account for the strategic interaction between Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly compute the final MEX of `c` for each test case under optimal play conditions.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
