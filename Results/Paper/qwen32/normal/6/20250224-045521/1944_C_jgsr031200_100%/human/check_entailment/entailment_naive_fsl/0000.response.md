Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the game's final score based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. The program seems to be attempting to count the frequency of each element and then determine the MEX based on a specific condition, but it does not account for the strategic moves of both players.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Optimal Moves**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c` by appending elements to `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of the array `c` by deleting elements from `a`.
   - The provided code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, nor does it consider the optimal strategy for each player.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the frequency of each element and then iterates to find the MEX based on the condition `if freq[i] >= 2: continue` and `if freq[i] == 1: cou += 1`. This logic does not correctly simulate the game's process or account for the strategic removal of elements by Bob.

3. **Missing Game Simulation**:
   - The code does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns. It only calculates the frequencies and then determines the MEX based on a flawed condition.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

**Example Input**:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
```

**Program Output**:
```
0
```

In this example, the program incorrectly outputs `0` instead of `2`. The optimal game play would involve Alice and Bob making strategic moves to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively. The provided code does not simulate this process and thus fails to produce the correct result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
