### Reasoning:

The given problem involves determining the final score of a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`. The goal is to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c` when Alice plays optimally and Bob plays optimally to minimize it.

The provided program attempts to solve this by counting the frequency of each element in the array `a` and then determining the MEX of the array `c` based on these frequencies.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Counting Frequencies:**
   - It initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It iterates through `arr` and updates the `freq` array accordingly.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - It initializes a counter `cou` to 0.
   - It iterates through the `freq` array from index 0 to `n`.
     - If `freq[i]` is 2 or more, it continues to the next iteration (since this element won't affect the MEX).
     - If `freq[i]` is 1, it increments `cou` by 1.
     - If `cou` becomes 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

The logic behind the program is correct because:
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to avoid filling the lower indices of `c` with elements.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to fill the lower indices of `c` with elements.
- The program correctly identifies the first index `i` in `freq` where `freq[i]` is 0 or where the count of unique elements is 2, which corresponds to the MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the first test case:
- `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
- `freq = [2, 2, 0, 0, ...]`
- The MEX is the first index where `freq[i]` is 0, which is 2.

For the second test case:
- `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
- `freq = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ...]`
- The MEX is the first index where `freq[i]` is 0, which is 4, but since the array is only up to `n = 4`, the MEX is 4 - 3 = 1.

For the third test case:
- `arr = [1, 1]`
- `freq = [0, 2, 0, 0, ...]`
- The MEX is the first index where `freq[i]` is 0, which is 0.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly determines the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
