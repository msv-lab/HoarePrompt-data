Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to play the game as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob and how they affect the final MEX of the array `c`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic for MEX Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each number in the array and then finds the smallest number that appears less than twice. However, this approach does not consider the optimal moves made by Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Turns and Strategy**: The program does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Alice should aim to add numbers to `c` in such a way that the MEX is maximized, while Bob should try to prevent this by removing numbers that could help Alice achieve a higher MEX.

3. **Optimal Play**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the number of occurrences of each number in the array. If a number appears an odd number of times, Alice can ensure it is added to `c` by making the last move on that number. If a number appears an even number of times, Bob can prevent Alice from adding it to `c` by making the last move on that number. The MEX will be the smallest number that appears an odd number of times, as Alice can ensure it is added to `c`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    freq = [0] * n
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if freq[i] % 2 == 1:
            print(i)
            break
    else:
        print(n)
```

This corrected version calculates the frequency of each number and then finds the smallest number that appears an odd number of times, which is the MEX of the array `c` when both players play optimally. If all numbers appear an even number of times, the MEX is `n`.
