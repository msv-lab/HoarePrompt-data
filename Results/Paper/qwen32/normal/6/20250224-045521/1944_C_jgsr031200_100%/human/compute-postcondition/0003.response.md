The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `arr`. Since `i` is the loop variable taking values from `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still have elements left to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` took the value of the last element in `arr`, and `freq[i]` was incremented to 1. For the loop to execute again, there must be another element in `arr` that `i` can take the value of in the next iteration.

Since the length of `arr` is `n` and we have already iterated over one element, there are `n - 1` elements left in `arr` to iterate over.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `arr` still has elements left and `i` will take the value of the next element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, and `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, except `freq[i]` which is now 1.** 

(Note: The specific value of `i` is not fixed at this point, as it will take the next value from `arr` in the next iteration.)
