Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, `cou` is 0, `i` is 0. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, then the current value of `freq[i]` is at least 2. Otherwise, there is no change to `freq[i]`.**
