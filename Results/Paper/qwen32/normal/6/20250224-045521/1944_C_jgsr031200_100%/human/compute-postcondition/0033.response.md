Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`. The length of `arr` is `n` and `n` is at least 1.
- `freq` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1`.
- `i` is initialized to 2.
- `cou` is initialized to a value that can be either 0, 1, or 2. If `freq[i]` is equal to 1, then `cou` is either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr`, `freq`, `i`, or `cou`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the value of the variable `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 2. There are no operations or conditions in the given information that modify the value of `i`. Therefore, the value of `i` remains 2 when the `print` statement is executed.

### Output:
Output: **2**
