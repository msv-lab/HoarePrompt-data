Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, except `freq[i]` which is now 3, and `i` is the next element in `arr`.**

Natural language: The value of `freq[i]` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables and their properties remain unchanged.
