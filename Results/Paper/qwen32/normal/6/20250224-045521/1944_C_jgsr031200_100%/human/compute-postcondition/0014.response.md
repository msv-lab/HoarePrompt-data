Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, `cou` is 1, `i` is 0. The current value of `freq[i]` is 1, indicating that the frequency of the value `i` in `arr` is exactly 1. Otherwise, there is no change to `freq[i]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `cou` has been incremented by 1, so `cou` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
