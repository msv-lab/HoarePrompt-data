Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 0. If `freq[i]` was 1 before the if statement, then `cou` is 1 and `freq[i]` remains 1, indicating that the frequency of the value `i` in `arr` is exactly 1. Otherwise, `cou` remains 0 and there is no change to `freq[i]`. The if condition `(cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0)` is true, meaning either `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0.**
