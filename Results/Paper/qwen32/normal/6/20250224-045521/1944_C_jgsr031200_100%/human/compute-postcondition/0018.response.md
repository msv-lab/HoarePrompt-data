Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 0, `cou` is either 0 or 1, `freq[i]` is either 0 or 1. The loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simpler terms, the state of the variables remains the same except that the loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement.
