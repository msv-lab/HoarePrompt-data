The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Since the provided code snippet only contains a `continue` statement, it does not change the values of any variables or break out of the loop or if statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `cou` is either 0 or 1, `freq[i]` is either 0 or 1. If `cou == 2` or `freq[i] == 0`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change to `arr`, `freq`, `i`, or `cou`.**
