The provided code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; `cb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`; `ans` is 0.**
