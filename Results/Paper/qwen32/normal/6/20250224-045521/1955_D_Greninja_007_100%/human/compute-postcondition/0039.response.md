Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the length of list `a`), `m` (the length of list `b` and the size of the window in `a`), `k` (the minimum count of elements in the window that meet the frequency condition), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `b` (a list of `m` integers). It returns `ans`, which is the number of windows of `m` consecutive elements in `a` where the count of elements that have a frequency less than or equal to their frequency in `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
