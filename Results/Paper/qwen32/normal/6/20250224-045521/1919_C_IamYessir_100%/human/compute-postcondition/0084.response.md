The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This affects the list `a` by adding a new element to it, but it does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, or `y` directly. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `n` remains the same
- `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity
- If `b` is empty, `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`

After executing the code:
- The list `a` will have an additional element, which is `lit[i]`
- `x` will now be the last element of the updated list `a`, which is `lit[i]` if `a` was not empty before the append operation, otherwise it was positive infinity and will now be `lit[i]`
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `y` remain unchanged

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `x` is `lit[i]`, `y` remains unchanged**.
