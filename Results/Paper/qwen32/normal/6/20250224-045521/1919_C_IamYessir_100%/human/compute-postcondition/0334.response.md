The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of the variable `s` by 1. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, and the current element `a[i]` is greater than the previous element `a[i - 1]`. This condition about the list `a` and its elements remains unchanged by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is a list with at least 2 elements, and the current element `a[i]` is greater than the previous element `a[i - 1]; `s` is incremented by 1.**
