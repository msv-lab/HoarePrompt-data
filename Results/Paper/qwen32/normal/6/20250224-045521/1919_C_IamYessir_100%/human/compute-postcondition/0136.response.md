The code appends the current element of `lit` at index `i` to the list `b`. This means `b` will now have one more element, which is `lit[i]`. No other variables are directly modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and now contains an additional element `lit[i]`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` was empty before the append operation, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before the append operation; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `x` is greater than `y`; `y` is less than or equal to the current element of `lit` at index `i`.**
