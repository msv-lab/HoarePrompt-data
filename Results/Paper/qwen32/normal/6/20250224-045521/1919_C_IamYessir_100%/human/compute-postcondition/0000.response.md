In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`. This implies that the loop will execute based on the integer value read from the input, which is `t` as per the problem statement.

Let's break down the requirements:

- The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, so its initial value does not matter.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop executes the correct number of times. The other variables `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

Since the loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect the execution, we do not need to specify its value. The value of `t` is the only critical piece of information for the loop to execute the correct number of times.
