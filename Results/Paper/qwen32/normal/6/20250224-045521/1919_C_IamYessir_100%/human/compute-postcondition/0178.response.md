The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This operation changes the list `a` by adding a new element to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, `y`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged unless `a` was previously empty or if the new element in `a` affects `x`.

Here's the detailed breakdown:
- `a` is updated to include `lit[i]` as its new last element.
- If `a` was previously empty, `x` is now set to `lit[i]` because `x` is defined as the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty.
- `i` is incremented by 1 as per the given initial state.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `y`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list containing elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y`, and now includes `lit[i]`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty, otherwise it remains the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the list `a` now includes the element `lit[i]`, and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was empty before. All other variables remain the same.
