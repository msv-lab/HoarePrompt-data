The code snippet provided appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This will change the contents of `b` and potentially update the value of `y` since `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are lists containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y` for `a`, and `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x` for `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty; `y` is the last element of `b` (previously `float('inf')` if `b` was empty); `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`. `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**

In simpler terms, the list `b` now contains one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The value of `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
