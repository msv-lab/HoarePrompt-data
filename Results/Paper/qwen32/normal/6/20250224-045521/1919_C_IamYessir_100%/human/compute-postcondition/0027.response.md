Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are either empty lists or not; `cp` remains 0. If `y >= lit[i]`, then `b` is not an empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, if `lit[i] > x`, then `lit[i]` is appended to `b` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x >= lit[i] > y`, then `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was empty or `lit[i]` is the new last element of `a`. `y` is less than `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is not appended to `b`.**
