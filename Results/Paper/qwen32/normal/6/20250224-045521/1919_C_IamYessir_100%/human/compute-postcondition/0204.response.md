The code snippet provided appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This action directly affects the list `b` by adding a new element to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `x`, `y`, `s`, and `i`) are not directly modified by this operation.

Since `lit[i]` is being appended to `b`, the list `b` will now include this new element. The other variables maintain their previous values unless they are dependent on the changes in `b`. In this case, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. Since `b` is now not empty (assuming `lit[i]` is added successfully), `y` will be updated to `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are lists containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y` for `a`, and `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x` for `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty; `y` is `lit[i]`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`. `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
