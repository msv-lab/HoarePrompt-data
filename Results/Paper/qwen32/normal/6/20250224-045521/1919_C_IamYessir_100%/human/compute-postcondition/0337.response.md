The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the current element being compared, and `a` is a list with at least 2 elements.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the index of the current element being compared, and since the loop iterates from `1` to `len(a) - 1`, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration to proceed, provided `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`.

State: **`a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is `i + 1`** 

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we express the next state in terms of `i + 1`. The variable `s` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted here.
