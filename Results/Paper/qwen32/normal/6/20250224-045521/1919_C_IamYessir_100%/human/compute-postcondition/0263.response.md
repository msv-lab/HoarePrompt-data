Postcondition: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element. `n` is an input integer greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string. `a` is either an empty list or has one more element `lit[i]` appended to it if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. `b` is either an empty list or has `lit[i]` appended to it if `y < lit[i]`; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged. `cp` is 0. If `a` was an empty list before, `x` is now `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`; otherwise, `x` remains `float('inf')`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is now `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x`; otherwise, `y` remains `float('inf')`. If `lit[i] > x`, `y` is `lit[i]` and `s` is incremented by 1. If `lit[i]` is not greater than `x`, `y` remains the same and `s` remains unchanged. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. `y` is less than or equal to `lit[i]`.**
