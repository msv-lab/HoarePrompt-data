The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 4, the element `lit[4]` is appended to `a`. This means `a` will now include this new element, and no other variables are directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list and now includes `lit[4]` as its last element, `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `cp` is 0, `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is updated based on the conditions described. If `b` was initially empty, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`, `i` is 4.**
