### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by distributing the elements of the array into two subsequences `a` and `b` based on certain conditions. It then calculates the penalty for each subsequence and sums them up to get the total penalty. However, the logic used for distributing the elements between the two subsequences is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Initialization**: Two empty lists `a` and `b` are initialized. Also, a counter `cp` is initialized to 0, but it is not used anywhere in the code.

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   - For each element in the input list `lit`, the program compares the last elements of `a` and `b` (or `inf` if the list is empty) to decide where to place the current element.
   - The conditions used for placing the element in either `a` or `b` are not optimal and do not guarantee the minimum penalty.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The penalty for each subsequence is calculated by counting the number of times an element is greater than its previous element.
   - The total penalty is the sum of penalties of `a` and `b`.

The key issue with the program is the distribution logic. The program does not ensure that the subsequences `a` and `b` are formed in a way that minimizes the total penalty. A more optimal approach would be to sort the array and then split it into two parts in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences is minimized. However, the given program does not do this.

For example, consider the second test case in the problem statement:
- Input: `8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3`
- Expected output: `1`
- The program might distribute the elements in a way that does not yield the minimum penalty.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
