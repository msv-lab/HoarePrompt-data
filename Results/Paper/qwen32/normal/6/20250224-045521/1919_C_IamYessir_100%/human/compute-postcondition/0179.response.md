The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This will change the list `a` by adding one more element to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged unless `lit[i]` meets the condition to update `x` or `s`.

Since `a` has a new element, `x` will be updated to the last element of `a` if `a` was not empty before, or it will remain `float('inf')` if `a` was empty and now contains only one element, which is `lit[i]`. However, since `a` is being appended to, it is no longer empty, and `x` will be the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`.

The variable `s` will be updated if `lit[i]` is greater than the previous element in `a`. If `a` had only one element before this append operation, there is no previous element to compare `lit[i]` with, so `s` remains unchanged. If `a` had more than one element, `s` will be incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the previous element in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` contains all its previous elements plus `lit[i]`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the previous element in `a`, otherwise `s` remains the same; `i` is `i + 1`.**
