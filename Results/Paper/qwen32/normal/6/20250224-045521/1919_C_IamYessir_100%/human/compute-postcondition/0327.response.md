Postcondition: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1). `n` is an input integer greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string. `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list. `b` is a list that includes `lit[4]` as its last element if `lit[4] > y`, and `y` is updated to `lit[4]` if `lit[4] > y`. `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[4] > x` and `lit[4] > y`. `cp` is 0. `i` is 5. If `x == y`, `a` includes `lit[5]` as its last element, and `x` is updated to `lit[5]`. If `x < y` and `lit[5]` is greater than `x`, `a` includes `lit[5]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[5]` if `a` was initially empty. If `x < y` and `lit[5]` is greater than `y`, `b` includes `lit[5]` as its last element, `y` is updated to `lit[5]`, and `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[5] > x`. If `x < y` and `lit[5]` is less than or equal to `y` and `lit[5]` is less than or equal to `x`, `b` and `s` remain unchanged. If `x < y` and `lit[5]` is equal to `y`, `a` includes `lit[5]` as its last element, and `x` is updated to `lit[5]`. If `x >= y` and `lit[5]` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, `b` includes `lit[5]` as its last element. Otherwise, if `x >= y`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, `s`, `x`, or `y` based on `lit[5]`. If `a` was not initially empty, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` was initially empty, `y` is `float('inf')`.**
