Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a` (which remains undefined since `a` is empty); `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')` (which remains `float('inf')` since `b` is empty); `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; the length of `a` is 0`.**
