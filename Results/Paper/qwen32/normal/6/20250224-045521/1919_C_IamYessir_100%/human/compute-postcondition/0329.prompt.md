Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1). `n` is an input integer greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string. `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x < lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[i]`. `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `lit[i] > y`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `y` to `lit[i]` and incrementing `s` by 1 if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y`. `cp` is 0. If `x` was initially `float('inf')` and `lit[i] > y`, `x` becomes `lit[i]`. If `y` was initially `float('inf')` and `lit[i] > x`, `y` becomes `lit[i]`. If `lit[i] > x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]` and `s` is incremented by 1. If `lit[i]` is not greater than `x`, `y` remains the same and `s` remains unchanged. If `x > y`, `y` is less than or equal to `lit[i]`. If `x < y`, `x` is less than `y` and `b` is updated accordingly. If `x` equals `y`, `s`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1). `n` is an input integer greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string. `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x < lit[4]`, `a` includes `lit[4]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[4]`. `b` is a list that includes `lit[4]` as its last element if `lit[4] > y`, and `y` is updated to `lit[4]` if `lit[4] > y`. `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[4] > x` and `lit[4] > y`. `cp` is 0. `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is updated based on the conditions described. If `b` was initially empty, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. `i` is 4. If `lit[4] > x` and `lit[4] <= y`, `a` includes `lit[4]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[4]`. If `lit[4] <= x` and `lit[4] > y`, `b` includes `lit[4]` as its last element, `y` is updated to `lit[4]`, and `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[4] > x`. If `lit[4] <= y` and `lit[4] <= x`, `b` and `s` remain unchanged. If `x == y`, the list `a` includes `lit[4]` as its last element, and `x` is updated to `lit[4]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1). `n` is an input integer greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string. `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and `b` is a list. If `x > y` and `y >= lit[5]`, `b` includes `lit[5]` as its last element if `lit[5] > y`, and `y` is updated to `lit[5]` if `lit[5] > y`. `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[5] > x` and `lit[5] > y`. If `x > y` and `y < lit[5]`, `a` includes `lit[5]` as its last element if `lit[5] > x` and `lit[5] <= y` or if `x >= lit[5] and lit[5] > y`. `b` includes `lit[5]` as its last element if `lit[5] > x`. `y` is updated to `lit[5]` if `lit[5] > y`. `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[5] > x` and `lit[5] > y` or if `lit[5] > x` and `lit[5] <= y` and `lit[5] > y`. If `x <= y` and `x == y`, `a` includes `lit[5]` as its last element, and `x` is updated to `lit[5]`. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `lit[5]` is greater than `x`, `a` includes `lit[5]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[5]` if `a` was initially empty. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `lit[5]` is greater than `y`, `b` includes `lit[5]` as its last element, `y` is updated to `lit[5]`, and `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[5] > x`. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `lit[5]` is less than or equal to `y` and `lit[5]` is less than or equal to `x`, `b` and `s` remain unchanged. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `lit[5]` is equal to `y`, `a` includes `lit[5]` as its last element, and `x` is updated to `lit[5]`. If `x >= y` and `lit[5]` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, `b` includes `lit[5]` as its last element. Otherwise, if `x >= y`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, `s`, `x`, or `y` based on `lit[5]`. `cp` is 0. `i` is 5. If `a` was initially empty, `x` is `float('inf')` and `a` includes `lit[4]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[4]`. If `b` was initially empty, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` was not initially `float('inf')`, `x` is the last element of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
