The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The variables `t`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, and `cp` are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0**
