The code snippet provided updates the `lit` variable by reading a new list of integers from the input. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, `y`, or `s`. The `lit` variable now holds the new list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.**
