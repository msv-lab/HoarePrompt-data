The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means the list `a` will now have one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, `y`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string.
- `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list.
- `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list.
- `cp` is 0.
- If `a` is an empty list, `x` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`.
- If `b` is an empty list, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.
- `x` is equal to `y`.

After the execution of `a.append(lit[i])`, the list `a` will have `lit[i]` as its new last element. If `a` was previously empty, it will no longer be empty, and `x` will be updated to `lit[i]`. If `a` was not empty, `x` will also be updated to `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is a list with `lit[i]` appended; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is the last element of `b`.**
