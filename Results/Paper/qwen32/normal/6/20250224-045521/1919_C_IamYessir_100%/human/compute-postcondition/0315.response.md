The provided code snippet appends `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 5, so `lit[i]` is `lit[5]`. The value of `lit[5]` is added to the end of the list `a`.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `cp`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1); `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and now includes `lit[5]` as its last element; `b` is a list that includes `lit[4]` as its last element if `lit[4] > y`, and `y` is updated to `lit[4]` if `lit[4] > y`; `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[4] > x` and `lit[4] > y`; `cp` is 0; `i` is 5.**
