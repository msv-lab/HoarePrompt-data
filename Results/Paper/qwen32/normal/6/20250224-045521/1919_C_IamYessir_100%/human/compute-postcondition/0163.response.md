Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `y >= lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x == y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `lit[i]` is either equal to `x` (if `x >= lit[i]`), or greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y` (if `y >= lit[i] > x`), or greater than `y` (if `lit[i] > y`), and `x` and `y` are updated accordingly.**
