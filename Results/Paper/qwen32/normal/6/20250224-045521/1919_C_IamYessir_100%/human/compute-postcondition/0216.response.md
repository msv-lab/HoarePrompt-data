Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `lit` remains unchanged; `a` must contain more than one element; `b` contains elements from `lit` based on the conditions; `cp` remains 0; `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`; `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0.**
