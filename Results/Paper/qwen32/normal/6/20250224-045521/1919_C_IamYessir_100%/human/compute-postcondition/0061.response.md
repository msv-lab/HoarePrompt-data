The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means the list `a` will now contain one more element, specifically `lit[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and other variables such as `t`, `n`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation.

Since `a` now has a new element, `x` will be updated to the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are either empty lists or contain elements from `lit` where each element in `a` is less than or equal to `x` and each element in `b` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`; `cp` remains 0; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; and `x` is less than or equal to `y`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
