Postcondition: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1). `n` is an input integer greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string. `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `lit[5] > x`, `a` includes `lit[5]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[5]`. If `x >= lit[5] and lit[5] > y`, `a` includes `lit[5]` as its last element. `b` is a list that includes `lit[5]` as its last element if `lit[5] > x`. `y` is updated to `lit[5]` if `lit[5] > y`. `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[5] > x` and `lit[5] > y` or if `lit[5] > x` and `lit[5] <= y` and `lit[5] > y`. `cp` is 0. `i` is 5.**
