Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `lit[i] > y`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, then `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty, otherwise `x` remains the last element of the original `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b` if `b` is not an empty list; `x` is less than `y`; and if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]`.**
