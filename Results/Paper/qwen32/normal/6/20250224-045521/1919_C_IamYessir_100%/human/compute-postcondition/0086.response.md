The code appends the element at index `i` of list `lit` to list `b`. This changes the value of `b` by adding the new element. The values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged based on the provided initial state. The value of `y` will also remain the same unless `b` was previously empty, in which case it will now be the last element of `b` (which is `lit[i]`).

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. If `b` was empty, `y` is now `lit[i]`, otherwise `y` is the last element of the list `b`. `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
