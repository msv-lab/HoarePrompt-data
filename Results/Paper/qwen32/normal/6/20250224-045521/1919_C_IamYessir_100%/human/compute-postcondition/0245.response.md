The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to the variable `x`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, and `cp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is not an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a`.**
