Postcondition: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1); `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and now includes `lit[5]` as its last element if `x >= lit[5] and lit[5] > y`; `b` is a list that includes `lit[4]` as its last element if `lit[4] > y`, and `y` is updated to `lit[4]` if `lit[4] > y`; `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[4] > x` and `lit[4] > y`; `cp` is 0; `i` is 5.**
