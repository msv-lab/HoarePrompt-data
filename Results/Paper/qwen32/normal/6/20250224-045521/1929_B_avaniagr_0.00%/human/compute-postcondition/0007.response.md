The code snippet takes the string `s`, splits it into substrings, converts those substrings into integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` were previously assigned integer values from the first and second substrings of the next line in the input file, and `s` was the next line in the input file. After the code executes, `n` and `k` will be updated to the integer values derived from splitting and converting `s`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the first substring from `s`, `k` is the integer value of the second substring from `s`, `s` is the next line in the input file.**
