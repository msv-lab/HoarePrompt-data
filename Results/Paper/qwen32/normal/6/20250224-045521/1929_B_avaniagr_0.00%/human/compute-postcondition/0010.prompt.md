Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function receives input for multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. n represents the size of the square grid, and k represents the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (
        k == 4 * n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `k` is the second integer from the split string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the integer value of the first substring from `s`, `k` is the integer value of the second substring from `s`, `s` is the next line in the input file.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the integer value of the first substring from `s`, `k` is the integer value of the second substring from `s`, `s` is the next line in the input file.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
