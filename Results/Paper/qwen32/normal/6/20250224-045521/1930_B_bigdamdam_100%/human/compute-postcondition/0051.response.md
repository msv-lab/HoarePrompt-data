To determine the output of the `print(*p)` statement, we need to understand how the list `p` is constructed based on the given initial state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Constraints:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). (This variable `t` is not directly used in the construction of `p` based on the given initial state, so we can ignore it for now.)
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `p` is a list of `n` elements.

2. **Construction of `p`:**
   - For even indices: \(p[2j] = n - 2j\) for \(j\) such that \(2j < n\).
     - This means that the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are filled by the formula \(n - 2j\).
   - For odd indices: \(p[i] = \text{ind\_initial} + 2 \cdot k\) for \(i\) in the sequence 1, 3, 5, ..., \(n-1\) or 1, 3, 5, ..., \(n-2\), where \(k\) is the iteration number starting from 0.
     - `ind` is defined as `initial_ind + 2 * floor(n/2)`.
     - This means that the elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are filled by the formula \(\text{ind\_initial} + 2 \cdot k\).

3. **Determine Values:**
   - Since `ind_initial` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it to be 0 for simplicity, as it is a common default value in such problems.
   - Therefore, `ind = 0 + 2 * floor(n/2) = 2 * floor(n/2)`.
   - For odd indices, the sequence starts from `ind` and increments by 2 for each subsequent odd index.

### Example Calculation:

Let's calculate the list `p` for a specific value of `n` to understand the pattern better.

**Example with \(n = 5\):**
- Even indices:
  - \(p[0] = n - 2 \cdot 0 = 5 - 0 = 5\)
  - \(p[2] = n - 2 \cdot 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\)
  - \(p[4] = n - 2 \cdot 2 = 5 - 4 = 1\)
- Odd indices:
  - `ind = 2 * floor(5/2) = 2 * 2 = 4`
  - \(p[1] = ind + 2 \cdot 0 = 4 + 0 = 4\)
  - \(p[3] = ind + 2 \cdot 1 = 4 + 2 = 6\)

Thus, the list `p` for \(n = 5\) is `[5, 4, 3, 6, 1]`.

### General Formula:
- For even indices \(2j\): \(p[2j] = n - 2j\)
- For odd indices \(2k + 1\): \(p[2k + 1] = 2 \cdot \text{floor}(n/2) + 2k\)

### Final Output:
The list `p` is constructed based on the above rules and will vary depending on the value of `n`.

Output: **p (where p is a list of n elements constructed such that p[2j] = n - 2j for even indices 2j < n and p[2k + 1] = 2 * floor(n/2) + 2k for odd indices 2k + 1 < n)**
