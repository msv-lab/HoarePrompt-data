The value of `ind` is updated to the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `p` is a list of `n` zeros, `ind` is now equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `p` is a list of `n` zeros, `ind` is equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
