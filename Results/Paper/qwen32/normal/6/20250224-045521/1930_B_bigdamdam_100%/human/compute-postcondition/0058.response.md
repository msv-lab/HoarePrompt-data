The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Initially, `ind` is equal to `n`. After the code executes, `ind` will be `n - 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be at least 1, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are 0 and the last element is `n`, and `ind` is equal to `n - 2`.**
