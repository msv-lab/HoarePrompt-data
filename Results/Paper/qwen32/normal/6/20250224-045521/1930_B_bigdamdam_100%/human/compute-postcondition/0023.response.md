The code snippet `ind += 2` increments the value of `ind` by 2. Given the initial state, `ind` is 5 if `n` is even and 6 if `n` is odd. After the increment, `ind` will be 7 if `n` is even and 8 if `n` is odd. The value of `i` is updated to the current value of `i` plus 4, but this does not affect the value of `ind`. The list `p` and the integer `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `p` is a list where the first floor(n/2) elements are n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-1) except the element at index `i + 2` which is `ind`, and the element at index `i` is `ind`, and the rest are 0, `ind` is 7 if `n` is even and 8 if `n` is odd, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 4.**
