The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Given that the initial value of `ind` is `n - 4`, the new value of `ind` will be `(n - 4) - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 6`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 2, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0]` is `n - 2`, `p[1]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n - 4`, and all other `p[i]` for i > 2 are 0, `ind` is `n - 6`, `i` is 2**
