The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n` with a step of `2`, so `i` is incremented by `2` in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `2` (since `i` is incremented by `2` in each iteration), and `n` must be greater than `2` to ensure that the loop condition `i < n` holds true.

The states of `t`, `p`, and `ind` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 2, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0]` is `n - 2` and `p[i]` is `n`, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`, `i` is 2**
