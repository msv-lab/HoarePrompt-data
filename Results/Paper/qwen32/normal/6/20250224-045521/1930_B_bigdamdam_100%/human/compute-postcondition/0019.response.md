The code snippet `p[i] = ind` modifies the list `p` by setting the element at index `i` to the value of `ind`. Given the initial state, `ind` is 3 if `n` is even and 4 if `n` is odd. The value of `i` is the current value of `i` plus 2, but since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we will denote it as `i + 2` in the output state. The rest of the list `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `p` is a list where the first floor(n/2) elements are n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-1) except the element at index `i + 2` which is `ind`, and the rest are 0, `ind` is 3 if `n` is even and 4 if `n` is odd, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 2.**
