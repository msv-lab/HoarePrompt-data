To determine what will be printed by the `print(*p)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions described for the list `p`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding `n` and `ind`:**
   - `n` is unchanged and is a positive integer.
   - `ind` is calculated as `1 if n is even and 2 if n is odd` plus `2 * floor(n/2)`.

2. **Calculating `ind`:**
   - **If `n` is even:**
     - `ind = 1 + 2 * floor(n/2)`
     - Since `n` is even, `floor(n/2)` is `n/2`.
     - Therefore, `ind = 1 + 2 * (n/2) = 1 + n = n + 1`.
   - **If `n` is odd:**
     - `ind = 2 + 2 * floor(n/2)`
     - Since `n` is odd, `floor(n/2)` is `(n-1)/2`.
     - Therefore, `ind = 2 + 2 * ((n-1)/2) = 2 + (n-1) = n + 1`.

   In both cases, `ind` simplifies to `n + 1`.

3. **Constructing the List `p`:**
   - `p` is a list where:
     - Elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., up to the largest odd number less than `n`) are set to `ind`, `ind+2`, `ind+4`, ..., respectively.
     - The rest of the elements (even indices and indices greater than or equal to `n`) are set to `0`.

4. **Determining the Elements of `p`:**
   - The length of `p` is `n` (since it is mentioned that `p` is a list where elements up to the largest odd number less than `n` are set).
   - The odd indices in `p` are `1, 3, 5, ..., (2k-1)` where `2k-1 < n`.
   - The values at these odd indices are `ind, ind+2, ind+4, ..., ind+2(k-1)`.

   Let's denote the largest odd number less than `n` as `2m-1`. Thus, `2m-1 < n <= 2m`.

   - The odd indices are `1, 3, 5, ..., 2m-1`.
   - The values at these indices are `ind, ind+2, ind+4, ..., ind+2(m-1)`.

   Since `ind = n + 1`, the values at the odd indices are:
   - `n+1, n+3, n+5, ..., n+2(m-1)`.

   The even indices and indices greater than or equal to `n` are set to `0`.

### Final Construction of `p`:

- If `n` is even:
  - `p` has `n` elements.
  - Odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., n-1) are set to `n+1, n+3, n+5, ..., n+(n-2)`.
  - Even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., n-2) and index `n-1` are set to `0`.

- If `n` is odd:
  - `p` has `n` elements.
  - Odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., n-2) are set to `n+1, n+3, n+5, ..., n+(n-3)`.
  - Even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., n-1) are set to `0`.

### Example for Clarity:

- **If `n = 4` (even):**
  - `ind = 4 + 1 = 5`.
  - Odd indices: 1, 3.
  - Values at odd indices: 5, 7.
  - Even indices: 0, 2.
  - Values at even indices: 0, 0.
  - `p = [0, 5, 0, 7]`.

- **If `n = 5` (odd):**
  - `ind = 5 + 1 = 6`.
  - Odd indices: 1, 3.
  - Values at odd indices: 6, 8.
  - Even indices: 0, 2, 4.
  - Values at even indices: 0, 0, 0.
  - `p = [0, 6, 0, 8, 0]`.

### Final Output:

Given the above construction, the output of `print(*p)` will be the list `p` with the specified pattern.

Output: **0, n+1, 0, n+3, 0, ..., n+(n-2), 0 (where n is the given integer and the pattern follows the described rules for odd and even n)**
