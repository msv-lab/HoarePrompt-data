Postcondition: **`l` is equal to `r`. `T` remains `T - 1`. `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same. `n` remains the same. `k` will be 0 if all possible reductions have been made, otherwise it will be the remaining value after the last reduction. `a` will have elements reduced to 0 where possible. `ans` will be the total number of elements that have been fully reduced to 0`.**

This postcondition includes all the details from the precondition and adds the specific condition that `l` is equal to `r` after entering the if statement.
