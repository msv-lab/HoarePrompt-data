Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1` based on whether `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is 3 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` were 0, 2 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was 0, and 1 otherwise, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
