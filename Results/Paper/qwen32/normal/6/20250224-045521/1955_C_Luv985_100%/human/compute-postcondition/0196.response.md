Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is 0, `r` must be at least 1, `mi` is the minimum between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be `k % 2`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions as specified.
