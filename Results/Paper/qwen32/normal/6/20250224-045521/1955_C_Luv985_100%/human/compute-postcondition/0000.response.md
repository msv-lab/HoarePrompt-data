The provided code snippet is just a comment block and does not contain any executable Python code. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The initial state is preserved, and no new values are assigned to any variables.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
