Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `a[l]` decremented by `mi` and `a[r]` decremented by `mi`, `l` is 0, `r` must be at least 1, `mi` is the minimum between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the decrement.**

In natural language: The value of `a[r]` has been decreased by `mi`. The values of `n`, `k`, `T`, `t`, `l`, `r`, and `mi` remain unchanged. The list `a` now reflects the decrements on both `a[l]` and `a[r]` by the value of `mi`.
