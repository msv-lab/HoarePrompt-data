To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to consider the conditions in the `while` loop head: `l < r and k > 0`.

1. **Variable `l` and `r`:** The loop condition requires `l < r`. Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because if `n` is 1, `r` would be 0, and `l < r` would not be true. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Variable `k`:** The loop condition also requires `k > 0`. Right before the loop, `k` is an integer, but we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

No other variables in the loop head (`l`, `r`, and `k`) need to be adjusted further based on the given conditions. The variables `T`, `t`, `a`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute the first time is:
State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is the integer representation of the corresponding string from the input string split by whitespace, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0**
