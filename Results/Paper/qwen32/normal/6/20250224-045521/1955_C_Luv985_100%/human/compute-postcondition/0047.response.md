Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is 0 and `r` is at least 1, or `l` is 1 and `r` is at least 2. If `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1, and `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. The loop or if statement is broken out of.**

The values of the variables do not change except for the fact that the loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement.
