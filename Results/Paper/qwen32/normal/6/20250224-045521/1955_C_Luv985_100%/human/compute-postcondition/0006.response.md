The code snippet converts the string `k` to an integer. This affects the value of `k` but does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer (converted from the string `k`), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
