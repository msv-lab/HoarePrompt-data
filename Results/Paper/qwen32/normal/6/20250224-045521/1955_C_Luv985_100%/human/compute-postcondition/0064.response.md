Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4 (or `t` is either 0 or 1 if `mi * 2 > k`), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 and is now `k - mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[l]` is adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k` and again if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[r]` is adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k` and again if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is incremented to `l + 1` if `mi * 2 <= k` or remains `l` otherwise, `r` is at least 1 if `l` is 0 or at least 2 if `l` is 1, `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[r]` is 0 and `r` is now `r - 1` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 2 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` and was originally 1 if `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is 4 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` and was originally 3 if `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is 3 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` and was originally 2 if `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` and was originally 0 if `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` remains unchanged if `a[l] - t - k // 2 != 0` if `mi * 2 > k`, and `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is updated to `k % 2`.**
