Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is False because not all elements in `arr` are the same; `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of identical elements; `i` is `n-1`.**
