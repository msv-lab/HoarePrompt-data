You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Subarrays**:
   - The code attempts to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray where all elements are the same and uses this to determine the minimum number of removals. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider all possible ways to make the array stop being beautiful.

2. **Handling of Uniform Arrays**:
   - The code correctly identifies if the entire array is uniform (all elements are the same) and outputs `-1` in this case. However, the logic for non-uniform arrays is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Removals**:
   - The code calculates the length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements and finds the minimum length. However, this does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of removals required to make the array stop being beautiful. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the code might incorrectly identify the minimum length of contiguous subarrays as `1` (for the element `5`), but the correct answer is `3` (removing the first three `3`s).

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Consider the input:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
- The correct output should be `3` (remove the first three `3`s), but the program might output `1` (incorrectly identifying the minimum length of contiguous subarrays as `1`).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the longest sequence of elements that can be made uniform by the given operation and then calculate the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break this sequence.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
