Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Logic for Determining the Minimum Removals:**
   The program attempts to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of identical elements. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic should focus on finding the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements and then calculating the minimum removals based on that.

2. **Handling Arrays with All Identical Elements:**
   The program correctly identifies arrays where all elements are identical and outputs `-1` in such cases. However, the logic used to determine if all elements are identical is flawed. It only checks consecutive pairs of elements, which could miss cases where the array has multiple segments of identical elements but not all elements are the same.

3. **General Approach:**
   The correct approach should involve identifying the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements and then calculating the minimum removals. The removals would be the total number of elements minus the length of this longest subarray.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If the array has only one element, it's already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements
        max_len = 1
        current_len = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
                current_len += 1
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
                current_len = 1
        max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
        
        # If the longest contiguous subarray is the whole array, it's already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful
        if max_len == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # The minimum number of elements to remove is the total number of elements minus the length of the longest contiguous subarray
            print(n - max_len)
```

This corrected version properly identifies the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.
