The code snippet provided sets the variable `flag` to `False`. This change affects the value of `flag` directly. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is False; `i` is 5**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` remains the input integer between 2 and 3 · 10^5, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and `n`, `arr` remains a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and `n` and is equivalent to `a`, `flag` is now set to `False`, and `i` remains 5.
