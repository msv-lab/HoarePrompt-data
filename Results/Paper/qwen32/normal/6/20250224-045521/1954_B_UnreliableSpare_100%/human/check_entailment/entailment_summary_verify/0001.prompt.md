You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It determines if all elements in the list are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the minimum length of any sequence of identical consecutive elements in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Understanding
We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it not beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) (where \(2 \le i \le |a| - 1\)) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Checking if the Array is Uniform:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same using a flag `flag`. If all elements are the same, it sets `flag` to `True`.
   - If `flag` remains `True` after the loop, it means the array is uniform (all elements are the same), and the program correctly outputs `-1` as no elements need to be removed to make it not beautiful.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:**
   - The program then iterates through the array to find the length of the longest contiguous segment of the same value.
   - It keeps track of the current segment's length (`cnt`) and updates `ans` (the minimum segment length found) whenever it encounters a different value.
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to update `ans` in case the longest segment is at the end of the array.
   - The program outputs `ans`, which is supposed to be the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

### Issues in the Program
- **Logic for Calculating `ans`:** The program calculates `ans` as the minimum length of contiguous segments of the same value. However, this does not necessarily give the correct answer for the problem. The program should find the minimum number of elements to remove such that the array is no longer beautiful, which is not necessarily the length of the smallest segment.
- **Example Case:** Consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The smallest segment length is `1` (the `5`), but removing just one element is not enough to make the array not beautiful. We need to remove at least `3` elements (the `3`s surrounding the `5`) to make the array not beautiful.
- **Correct Approach:** A correct approach would involve finding segments and calculating the minimum number of removals required to break the beautiful property. This might involve more complex logic than just finding the smallest segment.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
