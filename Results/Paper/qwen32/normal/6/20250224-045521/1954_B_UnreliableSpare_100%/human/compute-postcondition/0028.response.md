The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` will update the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. 

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')` if `arr[i] == val`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
- `cnt` is 1 if `arr[i] == val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.

Since `ans` is initially either `Decimal('Infinity')` or `0`, and `cnt` is either `1` or `0`, the `min` function will always result in `ans` being `0` if `cnt` is `0`, and `ans` remaining `Decimal('Infinity')` if `cnt` is `1` and `ans` was initially `Decimal('Infinity')`.

Therefore, the updated state will be:
- If `cnt` is `0`, `ans` will be `0`.
- If `cnt` is `1`, `ans` will remain `Decimal('Infinity')`.

Since the problem specifies that `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is 1, `cnt` and `ans` will be determined based on whether `arr[1]` equals `val` (which is `arr[0]`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `ans` is 0 if `arr[1] != val`, otherwise `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')`; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is 1 if `arr[1] == val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `i` is 1.**
