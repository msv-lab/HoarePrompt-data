Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `val` is `arr[0]`; `i` is 2; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been set to 0 by the provided code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
