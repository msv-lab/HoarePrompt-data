Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`.
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. If `v` is 0, then `v` remains 0, `u` is unchanged, `path` still contains only `v`, and `remaining_vertices` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(0)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is a list containing three vertices `[v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v` (now removed). If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. `d` is 0. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is `[v, v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
