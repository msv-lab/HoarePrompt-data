The code snippet `v, u = func_1(d)` will reassign the values of `v` and `u` based on the return values of `func_1(d)`. Since `d` is 0, the new values of `v` and `u` will depend on what `func_1(0)` returns.

Given the initial state, `v` and `u` are initially set to the first and second values returned by `func_1(d)`. After the execution of the code snippet, `v` and `u` will be updated to the new values returned by `func_1(0)`. The state of other variables (`path`, `remaining_vertices`, `n`) will remain unchanged unless the new value of `v` affects these variables as per the conditions provided.

Output State: **`v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(0)`, `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, or a list containing a single vertex `v` if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, or remains unchanged if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `d` is 0**.
