The only object in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one element.

Since `remaining_vertices` currently contains integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`, it inherently contains at least one element unless `n` is 1 and `v` is 1, which would make `remaining_vertices` empty. However, the problem does not specify such a scenario, so we assume `remaining_vertices` is not empty.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to `remaining_vertices` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. The state remains the same.

State: **`path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`.**
