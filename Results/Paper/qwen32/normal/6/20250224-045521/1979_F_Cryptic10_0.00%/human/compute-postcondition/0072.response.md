The code snippet provided is `continue`, which will skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Given the initial state, no variables are directly modified by the `continue` statement itself. The values of `v`, `u`, `d`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain as they were after the function calls and the decrement operation.

Output State: **`v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `d` is decremented by 1, `path` and `remaining_vertices` are updated based on the new value of `v` returned by `func_1(d)`. The loop continues with the next iteration.**
