The only variable in the loop head is `d`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `d`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`.

At the end of the last iteration, `d` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` would need to be set to the next value in the range, which is `n - 1`.

However, since `d` is currently `0` and the loop is iterating downwards, there are no more iterations to execute. Therefore, the loop will not execute again, and the state remains unchanged with respect to the loop variable `d`.

State: **`v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(0)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is a list containing three vertices `[v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v` (now removed). If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. `d` is 0. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described.**
