Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the single element `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v`; `d` is n - 1; `v` is 0; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`.**

In simpler terms, the `path` list now contains one element, which is `v`. The `remaining_vertices` set no longer includes `v`. All other variables retain their initial values.
