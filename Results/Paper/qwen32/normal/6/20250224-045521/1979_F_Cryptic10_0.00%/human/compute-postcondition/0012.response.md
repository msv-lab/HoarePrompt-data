The `break` statement will exit the innermost loop or if statement, but it does not change any of the variable values. Therefore, the values of `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the single element `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v`; `d` is n - 1; `v` is 0; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`.**
