Postcondition: **`v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `d` is decremented by 1, `path` and `remaining_vertices` are updated based on the new value of `v` returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the loop continues with the next iteration. Otherwise, the state remains as described without further changes.**
