Output State: **`v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `d` is decremented by 1, `path` includes `v` at the end, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `v` and `u` are set based on the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is decreased by 1, `v` is added to the end of `path`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the loop or if statement is exited.
