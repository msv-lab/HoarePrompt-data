The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the flow of the program outside of the loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any impact on the variables or the program state.

Therefore, the values of `v`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `n`, and `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is 0, `path` is a list containing two vertices `[0, 0]`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding 0, `n` must be at least 1, and `u` is assigned a value based on the function `func_1(d)`**.
