Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not guarantee that it will find a Hamiltonian path in at most `n` queries. The main issue lies in the strategy used in `func_2` to determine the Hamiltonian path. The program iterates over possible degrees `d` in descending order and queries for a vertex `v` with degree at least `d`. However, this approach does not ensure that the path constructed will be a Hamiltonian path.

To construct a Hamiltonian path, the program should strategically choose vertices such that each chosen vertex is connected to the previous one in the path and not yet included in the path. The current implementation does not ensure this connectivity, which is crucial for forming a Hamiltonian path.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Starting with the highest degree vertex and ensuring it is connected to the next vertex chosen.
2. Keeping track of the path and ensuring each vertex is visited exactly once.
3. Using the information about disconnected vertices provided by the query to avoid selecting disconnected vertices.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
