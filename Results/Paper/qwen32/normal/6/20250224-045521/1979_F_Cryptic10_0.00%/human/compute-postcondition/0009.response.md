The code snippet `path.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the list `path`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the value of `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive; `d` is n - 1; `v` is 0; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`. Additionally, `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**
