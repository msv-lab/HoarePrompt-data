The code snippet `v, u = func_1(d)` updates the values of `v` and `u` with the values returned by the function `func_1(d)`. The initial state specifies that `v` and `u` are the first and second values returned by `func_1(d)`, respectively. The values of `n` and `d` remain unchanged, and the state of `path` and `remaining_vertices` depends on the new value of `v`.

Given that `v` and `u` are reassigned by the function call, the output state will reflect these new assignments. The values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` are contingent on the new value of `v` and whether it is in `remaining_vertices`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is n - 3; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; if `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `path` is a list containing the element `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n inclusive.**
