### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph after removing (n-2) edges from a complete graph with n vertices. The solution involves using queries to gather information about the graph and then constructing the Hamiltonian path.

Let's break down the provided solution:

1. **Function `func_1(d)`**:
   - It sends a query to the interactor with a degree `d`.
   - It expects a response with two integers: `v` (a vertex with degree at least `d`) and `u` (a vertex not connected to `v`).
   - If `v` is 0, it means no vertex with degree at least `d` was found, and it continues to the next query.
   - Otherwise, it returns the pair `(v, u)`.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices of the Hamiltonian path.
   - It initializes a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates until all vertices are removed from `remaining_vertices`:
     - For each degree `d` from `n-1` down to 0, it calls `func_1(d)` to get a vertex `v` and a vertex `u` not connected to `v`.
     - If `v` is 0, it skips to the next degree.
     - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
     - It breaks the loop after finding a valid vertex `v`.
   - Once all vertices are in `path`, it prints the Hamiltonian path.

### Analysis:

- **Query Strategy**: The function starts with the highest possible degree (`n-1`) and decreases it. This ensures that the first vertex found will have the maximum possible degree, which is crucial for building the Hamiltonian path correctly.
- **Vertex Selection**: The function ensures that the vertex `v` with the minimum degree (among those with degree at least `d`) and the smallest number is selected. This is important for maintaining the order of vertices in the path.
- **Path Construction**: The function constructs the path by appending vertices to `path` and removing them from `remaining_vertices`. This ensures that each vertex is included exactly once.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly implements the strategy to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph. It adheres to the problem constraints and correctly handles the interaction with the interactor. Therefore, the solution is correct.
