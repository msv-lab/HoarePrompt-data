Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is n - 3; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged, meaning `path` is an empty list and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to n inclusive. If `v` is not 0 and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains `v` at the end of the list, and `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the state remains unchanged, meaning `path` is an empty list and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to n inclusive.**
