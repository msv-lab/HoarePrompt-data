The code snippet provided appends the value of `v` to the `path` list. The values of `d`, `v`, and `u` are determined by the function `func_1(d)`, and the state of `d` is updated to `x-1` where `x` is the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration. The if block is executed if `v` is 0, otherwise, it is skipped.

Given the initial state, the value of `d` is updated to `x-1`, and `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The value of `v` is appended to the `path` list. Since the specific values of `d`, `v`, and `u` are not provided, we will express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`d` is `x-1` where `x` is the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `path` has `v` appended to it.**
