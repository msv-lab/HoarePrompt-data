Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is n - 3; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged, meaning `path` is an empty list and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to n inclusive. Otherwise, `path` is a list containing the element `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`. `path` now contains `v` at the end of the list. `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v`.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `remaining_vertices` has been updated to no longer include the value `v`. All other variables (`n`, `d`, `v`, `u`, and `path`) remain unchanged from their initial state descriptions.
