Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is n - 3; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged, meaning `path` is an empty list and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to n inclusive. Otherwise, `path` is a list containing the element `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`. `path` now contains `v` at the end of the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` remains a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is still guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5. `d` remains as `n - 3`. `v` and `u` remain the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, `path` remains an empty list and `remaining_vertices` still contains integers from 1 to n inclusive. Otherwise, `path` now includes `v` at the end of the list, and `remaining_vertices` still contains integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`.
