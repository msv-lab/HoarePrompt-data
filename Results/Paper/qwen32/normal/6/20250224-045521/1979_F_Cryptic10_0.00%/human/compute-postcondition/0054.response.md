Let's break down the code snippet and its impact on the variables given the initial state.

The initial state specifies:
- `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
- If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is a list containing three vertices `[v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v` (now removed).
- If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.
- If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged.

The code snippet is:
```python
path.append(v)
```

This line appends the value of `v` to the `path` list.

Let's consider the possible scenarios based on the initial state:

1. **If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before removal):**
   - `path` was `[v, v, v]` before the append operation.
   - After appending `v`, `path` becomes `[v, v, v, v]`.

2. **If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` (before removal):**
   - `path` was `[v, v]` before the append operation.
   - After appending `v`, `path` becomes `[v, v, v]`.

3. **If `v` is 0:**
   - The state remains unchanged as described.

Combining these scenarios, the output state will depend on the initial condition of `v` with respect to `remaining_vertices`. Here is the output state in the required format:

Output State: **If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is `[v, v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is `[v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged.**
