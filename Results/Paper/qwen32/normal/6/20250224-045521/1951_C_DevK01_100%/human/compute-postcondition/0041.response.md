The code snippet assigns the variable `M` a new list of integers obtained from the input string. The initial state of `t` and `L` are not affected by this code. Therefore, `t` remains `t - 1` and `L` remains a list of integers obtained from the input string. The new variable `M` is a list of integers from the new input string.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `M` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string.**
