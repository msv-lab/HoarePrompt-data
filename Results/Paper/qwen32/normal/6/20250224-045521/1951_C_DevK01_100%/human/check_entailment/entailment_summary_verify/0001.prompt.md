You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific cost based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers. The cost is determined by sorting the list, selecting a subset of the smallest integers, and applying a formula that involves the values of `m` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day, the price of a ticket is given, and we can buy up to `m` tickets per day.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Key Points:
1. **Sorting Prices**: The program sorts the prices in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.
2. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets**: The program calculates how many days it needs to buy tickets (`q = math.ceil(k / m)`). This is correct because if we need to buy `k` tickets and can buy up to `m` tickets per day, we will need at least `ceil(k / m)` days.
3. **Handling the Last Day**: The program handles the case where the number of tickets bought on the last day is less than `m` by popping the last element from the sorted list and calculating the cost for the remaining tickets separately. This is necessary because the cost calculation for the last day is different from the previous days.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Sorting**: `M.sort()`
   - This ensures that we buy tickets at the lowest prices first, which is a greedy approach.
2. **Calculating Days (`q`)**: `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`
   - This correctly determines the minimum number of days needed to buy `k` tickets.
3. **Handling Full Days**: 
   - `N = M[:q]` selects the first `q` days with the lowest prices.
   - `n = len(N)` is the number of days we will buy tickets.
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy `m` tickets on each of these `q` days, and the cost can be calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This formula accounts for the increasing prices.
4. **Handling the Last Day**:
   - If `n * m != k`, it means the last day will have fewer than `m` tickets bought.
   - `w = N.pop()` removes the last element (the highest price among the selected days).
   - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m` calculates the number of tickets to buy on the last day.
   - The cost is then calculated as `mu * w` for the last day plus the cost for the previous days.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
4
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
4 2 8
8 6 4 2
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
6 3 9
5 5 5 5 5 5
```

**Output:**
```
10
64
1
72
```

The program produces the correct output for the given examples, which suggests that it is likely correct.
