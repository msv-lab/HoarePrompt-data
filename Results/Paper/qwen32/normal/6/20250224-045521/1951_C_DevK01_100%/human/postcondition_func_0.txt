The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific cost based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers. The cost is determined by sorting the list, selecting a subset of the smallest integers, and applying a formula that involves the values of `m` and `k`.
