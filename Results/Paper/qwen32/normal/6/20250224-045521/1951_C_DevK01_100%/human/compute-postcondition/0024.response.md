The code snippet assigns the first three elements of the list `L` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. Given the initial state, `t` is an input integer that has been decremented by 1, and `L` and `M` are lists of integers obtained from input. After the code execution, `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the values of `L[0]`, `L[1]`, and `L[2]` respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is `L[1]`; `k` is `L[2]`.**
