Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input line; `n` is the length of `N` minus 1; `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w`.**

Explanation: The value of `cost` is calculated as `mu * w`. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
