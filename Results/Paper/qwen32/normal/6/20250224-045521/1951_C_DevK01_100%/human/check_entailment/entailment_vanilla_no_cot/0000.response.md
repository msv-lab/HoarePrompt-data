Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in the logic used to calculate the minimum cost to purchase the tickets. The program incorrectly assumes that the optimal strategy is to always buy tickets from the cheapest available days, which is not necessarily true due to the price increase mechanism.

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Price Increase Mechanism**: When tickets are purchased on a given day, the prices for all subsequent days increase by the number of tickets purchased. This means that the optimal strategy involves balancing the immediate cost of tickets with the future cost increases.

2. **Incorrect Greedy Approach**: The program sorts the days by price and then greedily buys tickets from the cheapest days. However, this approach does not account for the future price increases, which can lead to higher total costs.

3. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic in the program is flawed. It incorrectly calculates the total cost by summing the prices of the cheapest days and adding the price increases, but it does not correctly handle the cases where the number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of the maximum tickets that can be bought per day.

To solve this problem correctly, a dynamic programming or binary search approach is typically used to find the optimal number of tickets to buy on each day while considering the price increases. The program needs to be revised to correctly implement such an approach.
