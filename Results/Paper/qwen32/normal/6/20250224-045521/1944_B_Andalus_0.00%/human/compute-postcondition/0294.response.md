Postcondition: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is increased by 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
