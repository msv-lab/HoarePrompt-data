The code `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`. Given that `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and `rdb` was initially an empty list, after executing the code, `rdb` will contain the value of `rgt[i]`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end. `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element. `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element. `rdb` is a list containing `rgt[i]`. `i` is 1 and `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.**
