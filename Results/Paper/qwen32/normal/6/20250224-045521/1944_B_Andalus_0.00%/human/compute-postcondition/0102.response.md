To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the conditions provided.

The loop iterates over the elements in `rdb`, which is a list of elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element. For each element in `rdb`, if `k - sz >= 2`, it prints the element twice and increments `sz` by 2. The loop breaks if `sz` becomes greater than or equal to `k`.

Given:
- `sz` starts at 0.
- The loop runs 3 times in the provided output states, indicating there are at least 3 elements in `rdb` that are printed twice.
- The loop will continue until `sz` is no longer less than `k` or there are no more elements in `rdb` to process.

Let's assume `k` is some value such that the loop can run at least 3 times. Since the loop runs 3 times, `sz` would have been incremented by 2 three times, making `sz = 6` after the third iteration.

The loop will stop if:
- `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`.
- There are no more elements in `rdb` to process.

If `k` is greater than 6, the loop will continue processing more elements from `rdb` until `sz` reaches `k` or there are no more elements. If `k` is exactly 6, the loop will stop after the third iteration.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we'll assume the loop stops after `sz` reaches `k`. Therefore, the final value of `sz` will be `k` if `k` is a multiple of 2 and there are enough elements in `rdb` to reach that value. If `k` is not a multiple of 2 or there are not enough elements in `rdb`, `sz` will be the largest even number less than `k`.

For simplicity, we'll assume `k` is such that the loop can run until `sz` reaches `k`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, `i` is `n - 1`, `sz` is `k`.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, the variable `sz` will be equal to `k`, and all other variables will remain unchanged from their initial states as described in the precondition.
