The code sorts the list `rgt` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is [], `sng` is [], `rdb` is [], `i` is 2, `sz` is 3.
