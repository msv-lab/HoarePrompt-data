The code snippet `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 3, the element at index 3 of `rgt` is appended to `rdb`. The value of `n` and the condition that `n` is greater than 3 remain unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `rdb` has an additional element which is `rgt[3]` appended to it.**
