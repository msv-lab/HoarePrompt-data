The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `rdb`. For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` needs to be the next element in `rdb`.

At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the current element in `rdb`. For the next iteration, `elem` should be the next element in `rdb`.

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least one element, `i` is `n - 1`, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `k - sz >= 2`, `sz` is increased by 2. No other changes are made to the variables.**

Since `elem` has already been used in the current iteration, `elem` should be updated to the next element in `rdb` for the next iteration.

Given that `elem` is the current element, the next state should reflect `elem` being updated to the subsequent element in `rdb`.
