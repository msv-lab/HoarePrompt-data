The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sz` is `min(k, 2*m) + 2`, `sng` is an iterable with at least one more element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz >= k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no specific action is taken for the else part.
