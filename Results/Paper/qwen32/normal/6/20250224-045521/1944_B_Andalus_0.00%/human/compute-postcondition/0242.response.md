The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `lst`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `sz` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. `T` is also not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input.**
