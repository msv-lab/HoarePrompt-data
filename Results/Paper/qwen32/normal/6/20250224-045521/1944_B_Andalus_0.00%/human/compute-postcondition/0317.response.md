The code snippet `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Given the initial state, `sz` was `k + 2` (or the largest even number less than `k` plus 2 if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed). After the increment, `sz` becomes `k + 3` (or the largest even number less than `k` plus 3 under the same condition).

The other variables (`rdb`, `sng`, `elem`, and `k`) remain unchanged. The condition `sz >= k` might now be true if it wasn't before, potentially leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the current state of the variables directly.

Output State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `sz` is `k + 3` (or the largest even number less than `k` plus 3 if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed), `sng` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`.**
