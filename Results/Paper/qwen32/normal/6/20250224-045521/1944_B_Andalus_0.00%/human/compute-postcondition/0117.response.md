Let's break down the given initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `T`: An integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t`: An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n`: Set to 3.
- `k`: The second integer from the input (value not explicitly given, but we know it's an integer).
- `lst`: A list of integers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- `lft`: A list of integers `[1, 2, 3]`.
- `rgt`: A list of integers `[4, 5]`.
- `ldb`: An empty list `[]`.
- `sng`: A list of integers `[2, 3]`.
- `rdb`: An empty list `[]`.
- `i`: Set to 2.
- `sz`: Calculated as `k + 2`.
- `elem`: Set to 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the value of the variable `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

From the initial state, we know that `elem` is explicitly set to the integer value 3.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `elem`, which is 3, followed by a space.

Output: **3 **
