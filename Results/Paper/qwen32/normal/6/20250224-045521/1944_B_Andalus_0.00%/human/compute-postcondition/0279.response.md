To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it affects the `rdb` list.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. During each iteration, the loop checks if the current element in `rgt` (i.e., `rgt[i]`) is equal to the previous element in `rgt` (i.e., `rgt[i - 1]`). If they are equal, it appends `rgt[i]` to the `rdb` list.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final state of `rdb` will contain all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that are consecutive.

### Output State Calculation:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is an input integer.
  - `k` is an input integer.
  - `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`.
  - `T` is at least 1.
  - `lst` is a list of integers from the input.
  - `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`.
  - `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
  - `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element.
  - `rdb` is an empty list.
  - `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their adjacent elements (both previous and next).

- **Loop Behavior**:
  - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.
  - For each `i`, if `rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]`, then `rgt[i]` is appended to `rdb`.

### Final Output State:
- The `rdb` list will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list.

### Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
The final output state is that the `rdb` list will have all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their immediate preceding element. This means if there are any consecutive repeated elements in `rgt`, they will be added to `rdb`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state except for `rdb`, which is populated based on the described condition.
