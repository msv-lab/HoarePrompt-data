To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `rdb` must contain at least one element.
2. `sz` is either 0 or 2.
3. The first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed.
4. `elem` is the next element in `rdb`.
5. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

From the information provided, we know:
- `elem` is the next element in `rdb`.
- The `end=' '` parameter means that the output will not end with a newline but with a space.

Since `elem` is the next element in `rdb` and we are not given the specific elements in `rdb`, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`.

The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element in the rdb list)**
