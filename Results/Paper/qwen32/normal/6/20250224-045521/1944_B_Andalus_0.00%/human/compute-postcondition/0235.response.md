Output State: **`sz` is `min(k, 2*m) + 2`, `sng` is an iterable with at least one more element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `sz`, `sng`, and `elem` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
