The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` are now set based on the input provided. The initial state of `sz` and `T` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1**.
