The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, and it is derived from the iterable `sng`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether there are more elements in `sng`. If `sng` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sz` is `min(k, 2*m) + 2`
- `sng` is an iterable with at least one more element
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`

For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still have at least one more element, and `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`sz` is `min(k, 2*m) + 2`, `sng` is an iterable with at least one more element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`**
