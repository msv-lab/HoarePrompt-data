The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`, which iterates over the list `sng`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `sng` is `[2]` and `elem` was `2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have more than one element. Since `elem` is the current element being processed, it should be the next element in the list `sng` after the current one.

However, since `sng` currently only contains one element `[2]`, the loop cannot execute again with a different `elem` value. Therefore, `sng` must be adjusted to have at least one more element.

Let's assume `sng` is adjusted to `[2, 3]` for the loop to execute again. Then, `elem` should be `3` for the next iteration.

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is 3, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `lft` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `rgt` is `[4, 5]`, `ldb` is `[]`, `sng` is `[2, 3]`, `rdb` is `[]`, `i` is 2, `sz` is `k + 2`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
