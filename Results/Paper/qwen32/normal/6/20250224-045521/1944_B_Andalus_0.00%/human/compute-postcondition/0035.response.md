The code snippet `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the element at index `i` in the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the element at `rgt[2]` is added to `rdb`. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end. `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element. `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element. `i` is 2. `rdb` is a list containing `rgt[2]`.**

In simpler terms, after executing the code, `rdb` now includes the element at index 2 of `rgt`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
