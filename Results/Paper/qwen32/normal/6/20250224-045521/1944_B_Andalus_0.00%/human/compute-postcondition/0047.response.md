To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `T` is an integer (greater than or equal to 1) representing the number of test cases.
   - `t` is an integer (1 <= `t` <= 5000) representing the current test case number.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1) and represents the number of elements in the left part of the list.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
   - `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element.
   - `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element.
   - `i` is `n` - 1.
   - `ldb` must contain at least one element.
   - `elem` is the first element of `ldb`.
   - `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, where `sz` is not explicitly defined in the given state but is implied to be a size or count related to some part of the list.

2. **Key Variables for the Print Statement:**
   - `elem` is the first element of `ldb`, which is a list of elements in `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element.

3. **Output Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.
   - This means `elem` will be printed twice, separated by a space, and no newline character will be added at the end (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, separated by a space.

Given the information, the output can be described as follows:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the first element of the list `ldb` containing duplicates from `lft`)**
