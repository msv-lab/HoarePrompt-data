To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the code and how the variables evolve with each iteration. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Loop Iteration Overview**:
   - The loop runs `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it processes a list `lst` of `2n` integers where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice.
   - It splits `lst` into two halves: `lft` and `rgt`.
   - It identifies duplicate elements in `lft` and `rgt` (`ldb` and `rdb`), and single elements in `lft` (`sng`).
   - It prints `k` elements from `ldb` and `sng` (if available) from both `lft` and `rgt`.

2. **State Evolution**:
   - **Initial State**: `T` test cases, each with `n` and `k`, and `lst` of `2n` integers.
   - **After each Iteration**:
     - `lft` and `rgt` are sorted.
     - `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are populated based on duplicates and single elements in `lft` and `rgt`.
     - `sz` counts the number of elements printed.
     - For each iteration, `k` elements are printed from `ldb` and `sng` from both `lft` and `rgt`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After all `T` iterations, each test case will have processed its respective `lst` and printed the required `k` elements.
   - The variables `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` will be reset for each new test case.
   - The only variable that will retain its value across iterations is `T`, which will decrement to `0` after all test cases are processed.

Given this understanding, the **Output State** after all iterations will be:

Output State: **T is 0, all test cases have been processed, and the required k elements have been printed for each test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop has finished processing all test cases, and the number of remaining test cases `T` is `0`. The variables `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` will be in their initial state for the next test case or will be out of scope if all test cases are done.
