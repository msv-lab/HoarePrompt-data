The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given the provided state, `T` is an integer read from input, representing the number of test cases, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. To ensure the loop executes, `T` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the execution of the loop, we do not need to adjust its state.

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**
