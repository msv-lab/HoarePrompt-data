To determine the output, we need to analyze the given information about the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `sz` is defined as `min(k, 2*m) + 2`.
2. `sng` is an iterable with at least one more element.
3. `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
4. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, no additional actions are taken with respect to `sz`, `sng`, or `elem`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `elem` is the next element in the iterable `sng`. Since `sng` is an iterable with at least one more element, `elem` will be the first element when the `print` statement is executed.
- The `print` statement will output `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`), but it will not add a newline character at the end.

### Output:
The output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the iterable sng) followed by a space**
