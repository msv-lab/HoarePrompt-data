The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`, which iterates over the elements in `ldb`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `elem` to the next element in `ldb` if there is one.

Given:
- `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list.
- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is increased by 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.

Since the loop iterates over `ldb`, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in `ldb`. The states of `rdb`, `sz`, and `k` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

Let's assume the current `elem` is the `i`-th element of `ldb`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` should be the `(i+1)`-th element of `ldb`.

State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `ldb` contains at least one element, and `sz` is increased by 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged. `elem` is the next element in `ldb`.**
