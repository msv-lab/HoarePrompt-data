The code snippet `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `sz` is `k + 2`, after the increment, `sz` becomes `k + 3`.

The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is 3, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `lft` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `rgt` is `[4, 5]`, `ldb` is `[]`, `sng` is `[2, 3]`, `rdb` is `[]`, `i` is 2, and `elem` is 3 still holds true. The only change is in the value of `sz`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is 3, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `lft` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `rgt` is `[4, 5]`, `ldb` is `[]`, `sng` is `[2, 3]`, `rdb` is `[]`, `i` is 2, `sz` is `k + 3`, `elem` is 3.**
