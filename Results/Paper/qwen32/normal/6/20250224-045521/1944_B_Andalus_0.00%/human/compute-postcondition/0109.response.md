The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `sng` is `[2]`, and `elem` was `2`. Since `sng` only contains one element, the loop cannot execute again because there are no more elements to iterate over.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because there are no more elements in `sng` to process.

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is 3, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `lft` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `rgt` is `[4, 5]`, `ldb` is `[]`, `sng` is `[2]`, `rdb` is `[]`, `i` is 2, `sz` is `k + 1`**
