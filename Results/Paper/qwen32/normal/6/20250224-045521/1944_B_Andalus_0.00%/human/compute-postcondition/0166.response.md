To determine the output of the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to understand the context and the current state of the variables involved. However, the provided initial state does not explicitly define the variable `elem`. Given the information, we can infer that `elem` must be a variable that holds a specific value or is derived from the provided data structures (`lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`).

Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can make some reasonable assumptions based on the context:

1. `elem` could be an element from `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, or `rdb`.
2. The statement prints `elem` twice, separated by a space, and the output ends with an additional space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Without a specific value for `elem`, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`:

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and the output will end with an additional space.

Therefore, the output can be described as:

Output: **elem elem ** (where `elem` is the value of the variable `elem`)

If `elem` were to be a specific value, for example, `5`, the output would be:

Output: **5 5 **

However, since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, the most precise description is:

Output: **elem elem ** (where `elem` is the value of the variable `elem`)
