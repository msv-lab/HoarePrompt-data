Output State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is either 0, 2, or 4, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language explanation: The values of `rdb`, `sz`, `sng`, and `elem` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
