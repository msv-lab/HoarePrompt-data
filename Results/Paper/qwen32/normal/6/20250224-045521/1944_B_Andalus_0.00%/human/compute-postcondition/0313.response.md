The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has more elements, the loop will continue executing. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least one more element after `elem`.

State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `sz` is `k + 2` (or the largest even number less than `k` plus 2 if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed), `sng` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`**
