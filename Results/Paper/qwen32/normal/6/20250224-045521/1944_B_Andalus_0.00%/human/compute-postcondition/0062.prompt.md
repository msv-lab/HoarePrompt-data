Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer such that T is greater than or equal to 1, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, k is the second integer from the input, lst is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, lft is a sorted list containing the first n elements of lst, rgt is a sorted list containing the elements of lst from index n to the end, ldb contains all elements from lft that are duplicates of the previous element, sng contains all elements from lft that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, rdb contains all elements from rgt that are duplicates of the previous element, i is n - 1, sz is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, `i` is `n` - 1, `ldb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least two elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, `i` is `n` - 1, `elem` is the second element of `ldb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is incremented by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` after the increment, `sz` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition. If `k - sz < 2`, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `elem` is the third element of `ldb`. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no changes occur to `sz`. The condition regarding the breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement based on the comparison between `sz` and `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
