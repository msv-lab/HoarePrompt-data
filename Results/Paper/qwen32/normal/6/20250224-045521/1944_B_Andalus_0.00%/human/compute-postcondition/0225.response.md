Output State: **`sz` is `min(k, 2*m)` and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. `sng` is an iterable with at least one element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of `sz` and `sng` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
