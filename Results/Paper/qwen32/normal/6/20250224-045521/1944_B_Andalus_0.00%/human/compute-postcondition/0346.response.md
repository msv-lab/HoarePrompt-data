The `break` statement will exit the current loop or control flow structure it is placed in. This does not affect the values of the variables directly but changes the flow of the program by terminating the loop. The variables `rdb`, `sz`, `k`, and `sng` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rdb` has been processed up to the point where `sz` reaches `k` or the end of `rdb` is reached, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. Additionally, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. `sng` must contain at least one element, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
