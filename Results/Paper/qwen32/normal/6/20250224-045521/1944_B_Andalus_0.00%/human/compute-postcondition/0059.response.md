Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `elem` is the third element of the list `ldb`.
- `sz` and `k` are mentioned, but their specific values are not provided. However, the condition `if sz >= k` does not affect the value of `elem` directly.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function indicates that a space will be printed after the output instead of the default newline.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and ends with a space instead of a newline.
- Since `elem` is defined as the third element of the list `ldb`, the output will be the value of `ldb[2]` printed twice, followed by a space.

### Output:
Since the exact contents of the list `ldb` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical or string value of `elem`. However, we know that `elem` is the third element of `ldb`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the third element of the list `ldb`)**
