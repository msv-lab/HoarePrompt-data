The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. The value of `elem` remains unchanged as it is the third element of `ldb`. The condition that if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` will be checked with the new value of `sz`. If the condition is met, the most internal loop or if statement will be broken out of. Otherwise, no changes will occur.

Output State: **`elem` is the third element of `ldb`; `sz` is increased by 2.**
