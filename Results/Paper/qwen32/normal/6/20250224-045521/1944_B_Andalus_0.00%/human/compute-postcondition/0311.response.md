To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the context provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`rdb`**: Contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list.
2. **`sz`**: Defined as `k + 1` or the largest even number less than `k` plus 1 if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed.
3. **`sng`**: A list that must have at least two elements.
4. **`elem`**: The next element in the `sng` list.
5. **Condition**: If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Analysis:
- The variable `elem` is described as "the next element in `sng`". This means that `elem` is a specific element from the list `sng`.
- The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space, not a newline.

### Output Description:
Since the exact contents of `sng` are not provided, we can't determine the specific value of `elem`. However, based on the precondition, we know that `elem` is an element from the `sng` list.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the sng list)**
