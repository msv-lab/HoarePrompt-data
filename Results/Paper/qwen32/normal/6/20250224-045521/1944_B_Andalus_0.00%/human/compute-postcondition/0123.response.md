The code snippet `lft = lst[:n]` updates the value of `lft` to be the first `n` elements of the list `lst`.

Given the initial state, `lft` was `[1, 2, 3]`. After executing the code, `lft` will be the first `n` elements of `lst`, where `n` is `input_n`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is [4, 5], `ldb` is [], `sng` is [2, 3], `rdb` is [], `i` is 2, `sz` is 3.**
