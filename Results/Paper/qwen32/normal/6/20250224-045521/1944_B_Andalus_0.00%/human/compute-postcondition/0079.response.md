Output State: **T is an integer such that T is greater than or equal to 1, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, k is the second integer from the input, lst is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, lft is a sorted list containing the first n elements of lst, rgt is a sorted list containing the elements of lst from index n to the end, ldb contains all elements from lft that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements, sng contains all elements from lft that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, rdb contains all elements from rgt that are duplicates of the previous element, i is n - 1, sz is the minimum of 6 + len(sng) and k.**

In natural language: The loop will continue executing until either all elements in `sng` have been printed or `sz` reaches `k`. After all iterations, `sz` will be the minimum of `6 + len(sng)` (which accounts for the initial value of `sz` plus the number of elements printed) and `k`. The state of other variables remains unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's execution.
