Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains at least one element from `lft` that has at least one duplicate next to it, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them`. If `k - sz >= 2`, `elem` is the next element in `ldb` after the previous `elem` and `sz` is the previous value of `sz` plus 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `k - sz < 2`, `elem` remains the same and `sz` remains unchanged.**
