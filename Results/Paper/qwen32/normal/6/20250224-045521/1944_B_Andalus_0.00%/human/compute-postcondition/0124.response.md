The code snippet assigns the value of `lst[n:]` to `rgt`. This means `rgt` will now hold the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, and `n` is `input_n`, `rgt` will now contain the sublist of `lst` starting from the `n`-th index.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is `lst[n:]`, `ldb` is [], `sng` is [2, 3], `rdb` is [], `i` is 2, `sz` is 3.**
