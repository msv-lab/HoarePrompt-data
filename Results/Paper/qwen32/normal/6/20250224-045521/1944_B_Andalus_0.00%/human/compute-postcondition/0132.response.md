The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is 2 and `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, the value being appended is the same as `lft[1]`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is [lft[2]], `sng` is [], `rdb` is [], `i` is 2, `sz` is 3, and `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`.**
