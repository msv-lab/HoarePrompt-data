To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables involved.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1` (inclusive), checking if the current element in `rgt` is equal to the previous one. If they are equal, it appends the current element to `rdb`.

Let's break down the final state:

- **T, t, n, k, lst, lft, sng, and ldb**: These variables remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop body.
- **i**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`.
- **rgt**: This list is not modified within the loop, so it remains the same.
- **rdb**: This list will contain all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element.

Given that the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`, `rdb` will contain all values in `rgt` from index `1` to `n - 1` that are equal to the previous element.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **T is an integer such that T is greater than or equal to 1, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, k is the second integer from the input, lst is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, lft is a sorted list containing the first n elements of lst, rgt is a sorted list containing the elements of lst from index n to the end, ldb contains all elements from lft that are duplicates of the previous element, sng contains all elements from lft that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, rdb contains all elements from rgt that are duplicates of the previous element, i is n - 1.**

In plain English, the final state is that `T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `sng` remain the same. `i` is set to `n - 1`. `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element.
