The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `sz`, `sng`, and `elem` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sz` is `min(k, 2*m) + 1`, `sng` is an iterable with at least one more element, `elem` is the next element in `sng` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
