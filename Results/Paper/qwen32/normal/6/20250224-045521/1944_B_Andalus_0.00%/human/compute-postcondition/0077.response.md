To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `T` is an integer such that T is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input.
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
- `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements.
- `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element and must contain at least one more element.
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `sz` is 8.
- `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the last processed element.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Analysis:
The variable `elem` is described as "the next element in `sng` after the last processed element". The list `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, and it must contain at least one more element.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `sng`, and `elem` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, we know that `elem` must be one of the elements from `sng`.

### Output:
The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space. Since `elem` is an element from `sng`, we can describe the output in terms of `elem` being an element from `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from the list `sng`)**
