The code snippet provided appends the element `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is 3, and `rgt` is a sorted list of integers starting from the `n`-th element of `lst`. The value of `rgt[i]` is the fourth element in the `rgt` list (since list indices start at 0).

The variable `rdb` already contains `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`. If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, then `rdb` includes `rgt[2]`. The code snippet does not change the conditions for these existing elements in `rdb`; it only appends `rgt[i]` to `rdb`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3, `sz` is 3, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, and `rdb` contains the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`. If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, then `rdb` includes `rgt[2]`. Additionally, `rdb` now includes `rgt[3]`.**
