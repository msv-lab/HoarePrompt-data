The code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` modifies the list `sng` by appending the value of `lft[i]` to it. According to the initial state, `i` is 3, so `lft[i]` is `lft[3]`.

If `lft[3]` was not already in `sng` (which it would not be, given the initial conditions that `sng` is either `[lft[i]]` or empty), it will now be added to `sng`. Therefore, `sng` will contain `lft[3]` as an additional element.

The other variables (`T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `i`, `sz`, `ldb`, and `rdb`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3, `sz` is 3, `ldb` is `[lft[2]]` if `lft[3]` equals `lft[2]`, otherwise `ldb` is empty, `sng` is `[lft[3]]` if `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[4]`, otherwise `sng` is empty, and `rdb` is empty. `sng` now contains `lft[3]` as an additional element.**
