### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of players.
     - `m`: Number of throws.
     - `x`: Starting player.
     - `m` lines of throw information: `r_i` (throw distance) and `c_i` (direction).

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case:
     - Number of possible players who could have the ball.
     - Sorted list of these players.

3. **Logic**:
   - Start with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw:
     - If the direction is clockwise (`'0'`), move `r` steps clockwise.
     - If the direction is counterclockwise (`'1'`), move `r` steps counterclockwise.
     - If the direction is unknown (`'?'`), consider both clockwise and counterclockwise moves.
   - Use a set to keep track of all possible positions the ball could be in after all throws.
   - Adjust for circular indexing (using modulo `n`).
   - Handle the edge case where the modulo operation results in `0` by converting it to `n`.

#### Functions Analysis:
- **`func_1()`**: Reads and returns a line from standard input, stripped of whitespace.
- **`func_2()`**: Reads a line from standard input and returns it as an integer.
- **`func_3()`**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of integers.
- **`func_4()`**: Handles the logic for each test case:
  - Reads `n`, `m`, and `x`.
  - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
  - Iterates over each throw, updating the set of possible positions based on the direction (`'0'`, `'1'`, or `'?'`).
  - Adjusts for circular indexing.
  - Prints the number of unique positions and the sorted list of these positions.

### Correctness:
The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a set to track all possible positions the ball could be in after each throw, considering both possible directions when the direction is unknown. The use of modulo `n` ensures that the positions wrap around correctly in the circular arrangement of players. The edge case where the modulo operation results in `0` is handled by converting it to `n`.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
