Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least two elements, and `r` is an integer. `q` is the next element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains `(q - r) % n` as an additional element. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` also contains `(next_q + r) % n` and `(q + r) % n` as additional elements. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged. Since the `if` condition is `c == '1' or c == '?'`, `temp` now also contains `(q - r) % n`.**
