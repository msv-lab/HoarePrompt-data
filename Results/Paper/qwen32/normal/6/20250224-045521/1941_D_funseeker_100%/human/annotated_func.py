#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_1` reads a line from standard input and returns it as a stripped string. It does not take any parameters and does not have any direct relationship with the variables mentioned in the problem description.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a stripped string read from standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line from standard input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the cleaned string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters and does not contribute directly to the solution based on the provided code snippet. However, if we assume `func_1()` returns a string representation of an integer, then `func_2()` returns an integer value. No specific precondition can be derived from the given function signature alone.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer value that is the integer representation of the string returned by `func_1()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is the integer representation of the string returned by `func_1`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not take any parameters. It implicitly relies on the output of another function `func_1`, which is expected to return a string that can be split into a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are the result of splitting the string returned by `func_1()` and converting each split element into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of integers by splitting a string obtained from `func_1()` and converting each split element into an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer representing the number of throws made such that 1 <= m <= 1000, x is an integer representing the initial player number who throws the ball first such that 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `ans` is a set containing all possible values that can be reached by iteratively applying the operations defined by `r` and `c` for `m` times starting from `x`.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `ans` is a set containing all possible values that can be reached by iteratively applying the operations defined by `r` and `c` for `m` times starting from `x`. If `0` is in `ans`, `ans` also includes the value `n`. If `0` is not in `ans`, then `ans` does not include `n`.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of unique values in the set `ans`)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted values of `ans` (where if `0` is in `ans`, `n` is also included)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the number of unique player positions that can be reached after `m` throws of a ball, starting from player `x` among `n` players, based on the operations defined by `r` and `c` for each throw. It also prints the sorted list of these unique positions.
