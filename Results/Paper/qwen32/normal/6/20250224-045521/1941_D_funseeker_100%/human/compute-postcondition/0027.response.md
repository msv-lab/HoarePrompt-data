The code snippet converts the variable `r`, which is the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`, into an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is an integer (converted from the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` and is either '0' or '?'**.
