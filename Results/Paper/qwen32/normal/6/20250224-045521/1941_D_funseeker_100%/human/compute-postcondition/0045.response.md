Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least one unprocessed element, `r` is an integer, `q` is the next element in `ans` that has not yet been processed, which is `q_next`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q_next + r) % n`, `(q + r) % n`, and/or `(q_next - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`.**
