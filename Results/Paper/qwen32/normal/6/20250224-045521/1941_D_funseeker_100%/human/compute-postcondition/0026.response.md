The code snippet provided assigns the values returned by `func_1()` to `r` and `c` after splitting the output of `func_1()` into two parts. The specific values of `r` and `c` depend on what `func_1()` returns. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that it returns a string that can be split into two parts.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and the precondition that `c` is either '0' or '?' remain unchanged. The only changes are to the values of `r` and `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` and is either '0' or '?'**
