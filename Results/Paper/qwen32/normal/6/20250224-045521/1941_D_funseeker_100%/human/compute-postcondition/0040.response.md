Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, and `q` is the next element in `ans` that has not yet been processed. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, if `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing only the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0', '1', nor '?', `temp` remains an empty set.**
