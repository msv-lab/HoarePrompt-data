The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q - r) % n`. The initial state specifies that `temp` already contains one element, which is `(q + r) % n`. After the code execution, `temp` will contain two elements: `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, and `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
