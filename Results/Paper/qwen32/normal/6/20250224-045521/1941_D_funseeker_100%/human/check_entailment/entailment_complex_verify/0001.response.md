### Reasoning:

Let's carefully review the program and the annotations to ensure the program's correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It reads each throw's distance `r` and direction `c` using `func_1()`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` based on the direction `c` and the distance `r`:
     - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it adds the position after a clockwise throw: `(q + r) % n`.
     - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it adds the position after a counterclockwise throw: `(q - r) % n`.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the position wraps around the circle correctly.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` to handle 1-based indexing.
   - This step ensures that the output player numbers are within the valid range `[1, n]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic for updating the set `ans` with possible positions after each throw is correct.
  - The use of a set ensures that each player number is unique.
  - The handling of the 1-based indexing by converting `0` to `n` is appropriate.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where the direction is unknown (`'?'`) by considering both possible directions.
  - It also correctly handles the wrapping around of player positions using the modulo operation.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of a set for `ans` and the efficient input reading methods ensure that the program can handle the upper limits of the input constraints.

### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each throw and updates the set `ans` accordingly.
- The annotations also confirm that the program correctly handles the 1-based indexing by converting `0` to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It efficiently processes each test case and handles all specified edge cases.

**Final: True**
