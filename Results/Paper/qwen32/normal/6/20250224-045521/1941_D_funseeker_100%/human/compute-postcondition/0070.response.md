Output State: **`temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` depending on the value of `c`; `ans` is now equal to `temp`; `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.**

In simple terms, the set `temp` which contains specific computed values based on the elements of `ans`, `r`, `n`, and `c`, is now assigned to `ans`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c`) retain their original values.
