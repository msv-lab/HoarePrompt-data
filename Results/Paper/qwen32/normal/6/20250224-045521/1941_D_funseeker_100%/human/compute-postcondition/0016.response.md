The code snippet adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given that `temp` initially contains the value `(q + r) % n`, after the execution of the code, `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the values `x` and `y`, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0' or '?'. The set `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
