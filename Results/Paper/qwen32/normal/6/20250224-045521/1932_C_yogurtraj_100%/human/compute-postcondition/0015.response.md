Output State: **`t` is a string (the input value), `n` is the first integer read from input, `m` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1`, and the last character of `t` is not 'L'.**

Explanation: The value of `q2` has been updated to `l + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
