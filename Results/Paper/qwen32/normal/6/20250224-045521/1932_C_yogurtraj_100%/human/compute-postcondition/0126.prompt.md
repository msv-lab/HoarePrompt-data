Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input string, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and the rest are 0, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `k` is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y[i] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the new input string, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input string, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is now `k`, `ii` is `ii + 1`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is `((a[l] % m) * a[l + 1]) % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 2`. Otherwise, `k` is `(k * a[q1]) % m`, `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the new input string, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input string, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is now `k`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `i` is `i - 1`, `k` is updated based on the condition involving 'R' or 'L', `q1` and `q2` are adjusted accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the new input string, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input string, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is now `k`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `i` is 1, `k` is updated based on the conditions provided, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the conditions provided.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
