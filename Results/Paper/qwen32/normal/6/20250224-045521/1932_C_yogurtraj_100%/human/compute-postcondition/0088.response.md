The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new input string, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means the previous value of `a` is overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input string, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element from `n-2` to `0` has been updated to the corresponding value of `k` after all iterations, `ii` is `ii + 1`**.

In natural language: The list `a` is updated to the new list of integers obtained from the new input string. All other variables retain their previous values.
