To determine what will be printed by the `print(*y)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **`t`**: The new input string.
2. **`n`**: The first integer from the input.
3. **`m`**: The second integer from the input.
4. **`a`**: A list of integers obtained from the new input.
5. **`l`**: The number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`.
6. **`y`**: A list of `n` elements where each element from `n-2` to `0` has been updated to the corresponding value of `k` after all iterations.
7. **`ii`**: The loop variable `i` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
8. **`k`**: The final value after all iterations.
9. **`q1` and `q2`**: Adjusted based on the number of 'L's and 'R's encountered.

### Key Focus: The List `y`

The list `y` is described as having `n` elements, and it seems to be updated during some iterations or operations. The specific details of these operations are not provided, but we know that:

- The elements from `n-2` to `0` are updated to the value of `k`.
- The exact values of `y` before these updates are not specified.

Since we do not have the specific values of `n`, `k`, or the initial state of `y` before the updates, we can only describe the final state of `y` based on the given information.

### Final State of `y`

- The last element of `y` (i.e., `y[n-1]`) remains unchanged from its initial value.
- All other elements (from `y[n-2]` to `y[0]`) are set to the final value of `k`.

### Output Description

Given the above analysis, the output of `print(*y)` will be a list where the first `n-1` elements are the value of `k`, and the last element is the initial value of `y[n-1]` (which is not explicitly described but can be assumed to be the initial value before the updates).

### Final Output

Output: **k, k, k, ..., k, y[n-1] (where there are `n-1` occurrences of `k` and `y[n-1]` is the initial value of the last element of `y`)**

This description captures the most precise information we can deduce from the given initial state.
