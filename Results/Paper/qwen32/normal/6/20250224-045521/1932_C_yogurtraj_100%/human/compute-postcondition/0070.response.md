The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `(n - 2, -1, -1)`. This means the loop starts at `n - 2` and decrements `i` by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `i` should be the previous value of `i` plus 1 (since it gets decremented at the start of the loop).

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, if `ii` is the loop variable `i` incremented by 1, then `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `ii - 1`.

State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element updated to `k` and the `i`-th element updated to `k`, `ii` is the loop variable `i` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `k` is the value used to update `y[i]`, `q1` and `q2` are as defined by the conditions in the problem statement, `i` is `ii - 1`**
