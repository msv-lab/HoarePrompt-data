Let's break down the given initial state and understand what the code snippet will print.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- **`t`**: This is the new input string.
- **`n`**: The first integer extracted from the input string `t`.
- **`m`**: The second integer extracted from the input string `t`.
- **`a`**: A list of integers obtained from the input string `t`.
- **`l`**: The number of occurrences of the character 'L' in the string `t`.
- **`y`**: A list of `n` elements where each element is the value of `k` at each iteration of the loop.
- **`ii`**: This variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
- **`k`**: This is the final value after the last iteration of the loop.
- **`q1` and `q2`**: These are adjusted based on the last character processed in the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*y)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(*y)` statement will print the elements of the list `y` separated by spaces. According to the initial state, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the value of `k` at each iteration of the loop. 

Since the exact values of `y` depend on the input and the loop's behavior, we cannot provide the exact numerical values of the elements in `y`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

### Output Description:
The `print(*y)` statement will print the values of `k` for each iteration of the loop, separated by spaces. The exact values of these elements depend on the input string `t`, the integers `n` and `m`, and the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **the values of `k` for each iteration of the loop, separated by spaces (where `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the value of `k` at each iteration of the loop)**
