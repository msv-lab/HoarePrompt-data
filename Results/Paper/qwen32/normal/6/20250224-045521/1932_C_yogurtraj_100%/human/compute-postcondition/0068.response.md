Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element updated to `k`, and `ii` is the loop variable `ii` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If the current character of `t` at index `i` is 'R', then `k` is `(k * a[l + 1]) % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 2`. Otherwise, if the current character of `t` at index `i` is not 'R', then `k` is `(k * a[q1]) % m`, `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`.**
