Output State: **`t` is a string (the input value), `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `m` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `(k * a[q2]) % m`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `l + 2`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element being `k`, and `t[i]` is 'R' for some index `i`.**

In natural language: The value of `q2` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values as described in the initial state.
