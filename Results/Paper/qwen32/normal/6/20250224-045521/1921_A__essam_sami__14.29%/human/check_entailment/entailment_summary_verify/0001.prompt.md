You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the corners of a square and prints the area of the smaller square between two calculated values `n` and `x`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, and we are guaranteed that the input points indeed form a valid square with a positive area.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
1. **Identify Distances**: Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between two points horizontally or vertically can help us determine the side length of the square.
2. **Calculate Side Length**: The side length of the square can be either the horizontal distance between two points or the vertical distance between two points.
3. **Compute Area**: Once we have the side length, the area of the square is simply the side length squared.

### Examination of the Provided Program
The provided program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then prints the smaller of the two squared distances. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates.
2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - It calculates the squared distance between the first and third points: `n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.
   - It calculates the squared distance between the second and fourth points: `x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`.
3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - It compares the two squared distances and prints the smaller one.

### Issues in the Program
The program assumes that the first and third points, and the second and fourth points, are opposite corners of the square. This assumption is incorrect because the points are given in random order. Therefore, the program may not always select the correct pair of opposite corners to calculate the side length.

### Correct Approach
To correctly determine the side length, we need to consider all possible pairs of points and find the minimum non-zero distance (either horizontal or vertical). The correct side length will be the minimum non-zero distance between any pair of points.

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it makes an incorrect assumption about the order of the points and does not correctly determine the side length of the square.
