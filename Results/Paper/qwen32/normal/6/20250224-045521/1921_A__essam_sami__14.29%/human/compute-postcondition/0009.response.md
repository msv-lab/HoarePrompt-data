To determine what will be printed by the `print(n)` statement, we need to understand the calculation of `n` based on the given initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers provided as input.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).
- The current value of `x` is greater than `n`.

From this, we can see that `n` is the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `e`, and `b` and `f`. The exact numerical value of `n` depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f`, which are not provided. However, we know the formula to compute `n`.

Therefore, the `print(n)` statement will output the value of `n` as calculated by the formula \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).

Output: **n (where n is calculated as (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f))**
