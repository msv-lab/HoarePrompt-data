Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the area of a square given its four corner coordinates.
- The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
- The coordinates are provided in random order.
- The area of the square should be strictly greater than 0.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of the square. It calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two squared distances as the area of the square.

### Issues in the Program:
The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then prints the smaller of the two distances. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly determine the side length of the square. The program should calculate the distances between all pairs of points and determine the correct side length of the square.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the area of the square, we need to calculate the distances between all pairs of points and identify the side length of the square. Since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the unique differences in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the points.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```
The correct area of the square is \(4\). However, the program might calculate the distance between \((0, 0)\) and \((2, 0)\) as \(4\) and the distance between \((0, 0)\) and \((0, 2)\) as \(4\), and then incorrectly print \(4\) as the area, which is actually correct in this case but not due to the logic used. However, if we consider a case where the points are not in a straightforward order, the program might fail.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly because it does not properly identify the side length of the square. It only compares two distances and prints the smaller one, which is not a reliable method to determine the area of the square.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly determine the side length of the square in all cases. It only compares two distances and prints the smaller one, which is not a reliable method to determine the area of the square. A correct approach would involve calculating the distances between all pairs of points and identifying the correct side length of the square.
