The given Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `g` and `h`. This means that the values of `g` and `h` will be updated based on the new input, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a` and `b` are the two integers provided as input; `c` and `d` are the two integers from the input split by space; `e` and `f` are the two integers from the new input split by space; `g` and `h` are the two integers from the latest input split by space.**
