Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers provided as input; `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is calculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. If `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
