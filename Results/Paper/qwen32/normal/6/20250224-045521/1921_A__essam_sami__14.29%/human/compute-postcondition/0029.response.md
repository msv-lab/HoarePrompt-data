The code snippet recalculates the value of `x` based on the provided formula. The value of `x` is updated to `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a`, `b` are integers read from input; `c`, `d` are the new integers read from input; `e`, `f` are the integers read from the latest input; `g`, `h` are the new integers read from input; `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`; If `x` is greater than `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`; `steps` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `steps` at the end of the previous iteration.**
