numbers is a list of integers where the first integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
