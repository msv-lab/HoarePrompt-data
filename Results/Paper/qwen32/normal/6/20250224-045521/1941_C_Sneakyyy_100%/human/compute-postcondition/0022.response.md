The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than `i + 2`; `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`; If the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 3 and `i` is 9, otherwise `ans` is 2 or 1 and `i` is 5.
