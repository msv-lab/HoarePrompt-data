Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful. The current implementation only checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" in non-overlapping segments of three characters and removes them if found. However, it does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to minimize the total deletions.

For example, consider the input string "azapie". The program would check "aza", "zap", and "api" in sequence. It would not find "map" or "pie" in these segments and thus output 0 deletions, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 2 deletions to remove either "map" or "pie" by deleting the appropriate characters.

To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach or a more sophisticated greedy algorithm would be needed to ensure that overlapping substrings are handled and the minimum deletions are calculated.
