Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" in chunks of three consecutive characters and removes them by incrementing the index by 3 and increasing the count of deletions. However, this approach does not guarantee that the minimum number of deletions is made to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
7
pimapei
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

The string "pimapei" contains "pie" starting at index 2 and "map" starting at index 3. The provided program will only remove one of these substrings (either "pie" or "map") because it increments the index by 3 after finding a match. However, to make the string beautiful, we need to remove both "pie" and "map", resulting in 2 deletions.

The correct approach should be to find and remove overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string while keeping track of the minimum deletions required. The provided program fails to handle such cases correctly, making it incorrect.
