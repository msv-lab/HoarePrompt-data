The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` by reading an integer input. The value of `iterations` and the loop counter (which is `iterations - 1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())`, and the loop counter is `iterations - 1`; `n` is an input integer.**
