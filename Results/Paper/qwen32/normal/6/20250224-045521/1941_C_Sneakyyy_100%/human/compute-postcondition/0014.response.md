The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `s` to be the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a string with length greater than 5 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `a` is a string with length greater than 2.
- `s` is the first three characters of `a`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.

The value of `i` is 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 1 otherwise. Therefore, the substring `a[i:i + 3]` will be the characters from index `i` to `i + 2` in the string `a`.

If `s` was initially 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3, and `s` will be updated to `a[3:6]`.
If `s` was initially anything else, then `i` is 1, and `s` will be updated to `a[1:4]`.

Thus, the new value of `s` will be the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than 5 if the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `a` is a string with length greater than 2; `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`; If the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**
