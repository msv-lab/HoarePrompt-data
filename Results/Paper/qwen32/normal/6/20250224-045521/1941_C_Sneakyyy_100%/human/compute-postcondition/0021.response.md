The code snippet `i += 3` increments the value of `i` by 3. Given the initial state, `i` has a value based on the substring `s` of `a`:
- If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `i` is initially 6, so after the increment, `i` becomes 9.
- If `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', `i` is initially 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 5.

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by the increment of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than `i + 2`; `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`; If the original `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 9, otherwise `ans` is 1 or 0 and `i` is 5.**
