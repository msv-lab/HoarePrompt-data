The value of `i` is incremented by 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than 2; `ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `s` is the first three characters of `a`, and `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'.**
