The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `i`. This does not affect the values of `iterations`, `n`, `a`, or `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())`, and the loop counter is `iterations - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the value obtained from `input()`; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0.**
