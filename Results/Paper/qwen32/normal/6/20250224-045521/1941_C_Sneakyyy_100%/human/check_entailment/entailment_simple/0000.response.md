### Reasoning:
The given program is intended to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to ensure that it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The program iterates through each character of the string in chunks of three and checks if the current chunk is "map" or "pie". If it is, it increments the count of deletions (`ans`) by one and skips the next two characters (thus effectively removing the three-character substring "map" or "pie"). If the chunk is not "map" or "pie", it moves to the next character.

However, there is a flaw in this approach. The program only checks for "map" and "pie" in non-overlapping chunks of three characters. This means that if there are overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie", the program might not count all necessary deletions. For example, in the string "pmapie", the program would only count one deletion (for "map"), but in reality, two deletions are needed to make the string beautiful (removing the 'm' in "map" and the 'p' in "pie").

Let's consider the test case "pppiepieeee":
- The program will check "ppp", "pie", "pie", "eee".
- It will count one deletion for the "pie" at index 1-3 and another for the "pie" at index 4-6, resulting in an output of 2.
- However, the optimal solution is to remove the 'p' at index 1 and the 'p' at index 4, resulting in "piepieeee", which can then be further reduced to "eeee" by removing the remaining "pie" at index 0-2, resulting in a total of 3 deletions. But the optimal solution should be 2, which can be achieved by removing the 'p' at index 1 and the 'p' at index 4, resulting in "piepieeee", and then removing the 'p' at index 0 and the 'e' at index 5, resulting in "eeee".

The provided program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly and might not always return the minimum number of deletions required.
