The code snippet `a = input().strip()` will overwrite the value of `a` with a new input string, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters (as provided by the new input), `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer greater than 1, and `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
