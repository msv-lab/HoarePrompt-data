The code appends the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the `results` list. Given the initial state, `results` initially contains one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. After the code is executed, `results` will contain two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer greater than 1, and `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
