### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The matching criteria for the template are:
- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be the same as the i-th letter of the template.
- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of the template.

Given the test cases and the behavior of the functions, let's analyze if the provided program meets the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To check if there exists at least one position in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` where the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the character in `c`.
- **Logic**: The function iterates through each character position of the strings. If it finds a position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, it returns 'YES'. If no such position is found after checking all positions, it returns 'NO'.
- **Correctness**: This logic correctly checks the condition for the existence of a template `t` where `a` and `b` match it but `c` does not. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, it means we can choose an uppercase letter in the template at position `i` to match `a[i]` and `b[i]` while not matching `c[i]`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases.
- **Logic**: It reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly reads the input for each test case and processes it using `func_1`. It then prints the results, which are the correct answers according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It checks the conditions for each character position and determines if a suitable template exists for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
