The code snippet `c = input().strip()` takes a new input string, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters (as provided by the new input), `t` is an input integer greater than 1, and `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
