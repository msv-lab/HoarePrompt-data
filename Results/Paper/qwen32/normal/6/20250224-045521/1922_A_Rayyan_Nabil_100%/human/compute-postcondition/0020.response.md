Output State: **`n` is the input integer from the last iteration, `a` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `b` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `c` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `t` is the input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last iteration. The variable `t` will remain the same as the initial input integer that determined the number of iterations. The `results` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with the corresponding `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` values from each iteration.
