Reasoning: 
The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_2` function handles the input and output for multiple test cases, while `func_1` contains the logic to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not.

The `func_1` function checks each position of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` to see if there is at least one position where the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the character in `c`. If such a position is found, it returns 'YES'. If no such position exists, it returns 'NO'. This logic is correct based on the problem statement, as it ensures that the template can be constructed such that `a` and `b` match the template (either by matching lowercase letters or differing from uppercase letters), while `c` does not match.

However, the output hints for `func_2` are incorrect. The description provided for `func_2` does not match its actual functionality. The actual functionality of `func_2` is to read the test cases and use `func_1` to determine if there exists a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`, and then print 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The description instead mentions checking lexicographical order, which is not what the code does.

Despite the mismatch in the description of `func_2`, the code itself correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
