The provided code snippet is:

```python
n = int(input().strip())
```

This line of code reads an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts the input to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, and other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `results`) are already defined with specific conditions.

Since the code only modifies `n` and does not affect the other variables, the updated state will reflect the new value of `n` as provided by the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
