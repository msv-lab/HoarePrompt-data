You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: `n` is the input integer from the last iteration, `a` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `b` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `c` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `t` is the input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `n` is the input integer from the last iteration, `a` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `b` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `c` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `t` is the input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration. The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20. The function returns a value based on the comparison of these strings. Case_1: If `a` is lexicographically smaller than `b` and `b` is lexicographically smaller than `c`, the function returns "increasing". Case_2: If `a` is lexicographically larger than `b` and `b` is lexicographically larger than `c`, the function returns "decreasing". Case_3: In all other cases, the function returns "neither".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
