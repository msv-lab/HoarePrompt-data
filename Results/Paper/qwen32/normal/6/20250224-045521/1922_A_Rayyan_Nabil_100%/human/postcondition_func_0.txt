The function `func_1` checks if there exists at least one position in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n`) where the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the character in `c`. If such a position is found, it returns 'YES'. If no such position exists after checking all positions, it returns 'NO'.
