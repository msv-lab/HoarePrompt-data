The code snippet `a = input().strip()` updates the value of `a` by reading a new input from the user and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state specifies that `a` was a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, but this value is overwritten by the new input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters (as per the new input), `b` and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, and `results` is an empty list.**
