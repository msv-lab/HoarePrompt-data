The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use inside the loop. Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, we do not need to adjust its value for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to execute as long as the range `t` has not been exhausted.

Given that `t` is an input integer greater than 1, at the end of the previous iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1 (implicitly by the loop mechanism). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state and the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head, we do not need to modify them.

State: **`n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**
