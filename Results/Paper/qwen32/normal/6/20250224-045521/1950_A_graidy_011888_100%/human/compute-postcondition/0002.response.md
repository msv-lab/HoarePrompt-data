The code snippet reads three integers from the input, assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, and updates their values accordingly. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `n` must be greater than 0. However, `n` is not affected by the provided code snippet.

After executing the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided in the input. The output state should reflect these changes while keeping other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `n` must be greater than 0.**
