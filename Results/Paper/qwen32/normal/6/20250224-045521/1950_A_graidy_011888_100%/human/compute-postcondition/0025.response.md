Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, `n` is greater than 5, and `i` is 5. If `a < b < c`, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.**

Since the values of all variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged in both the if and else parts, the overall postcondition simply states that these variables retain their initial values after the execution of the if-else block.
