The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `n` is greater than 5, with `i` being 5. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are initially not assigned specific values but are constrained to be between 0 and 9.

After executing the code snippet, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values read from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, `n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5**.
