You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: After `n` iterations, the loop has finished executing. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of integers read from the input, and `i` is equal to `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was in the initial state, and `n` remains the same as well.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints "STAIR" if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, prints "PEAK" if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, and prints "NONE" for all other cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `n`.
2. It then iterates through each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
4. It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If true, it prints "STAIR".
5. If the first condition is not met, it checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If true, it prints "PEAK".
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description for determining if the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all possible cases as described.

Correctness: **True**
