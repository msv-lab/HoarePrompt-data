Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, and `n` is greater than 0. The condition `a < b < c` is false. If `a < b` and `b > c`, the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this condition. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b and b > c`.**
