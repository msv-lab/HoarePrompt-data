Given the initial state, we have the following conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
- The condition `a < b < c` is false.
- The current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy `a < b` and `b > c`.
- `n` is greater than 0, but `n` is not used in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

The value to be printed is explicitly given in the `print` statement. The string 'PEAK' is directly printed regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, or `t`.

Output: **PEAK**
