Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `n`.
2. It then iterates through each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
4. It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If true, it prints "STAIR".
5. If the first condition is not met, it checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If true, it prints "PEAK".
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description for determining if the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all possible cases as described.

Correctness: **True**
