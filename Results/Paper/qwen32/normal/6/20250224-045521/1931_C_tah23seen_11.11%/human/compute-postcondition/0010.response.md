The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition provided. After the increment, if `i` was initially 0, it becomes 1. If `i` was initially 1, it becomes 2. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is `n - 1`, and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; if the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is `n - 1`, and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.**
