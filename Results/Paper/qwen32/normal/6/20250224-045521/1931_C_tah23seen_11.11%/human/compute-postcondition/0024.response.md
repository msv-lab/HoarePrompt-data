The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The condition `i` is not greater than `j` still holds because the increment does not change the relative order of `i` and `j`. The condition `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` is now applied to the new value of `i`. The state of `j` and the array `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is unchanged, and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` for the new value of `i`.**
