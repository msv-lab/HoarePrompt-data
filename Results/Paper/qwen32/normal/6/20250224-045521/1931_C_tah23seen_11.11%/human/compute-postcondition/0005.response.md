Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `i` is 1; `j` is `n - 2`. The first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
