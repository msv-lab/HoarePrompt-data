To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop continues to execute as long as `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is true, and during each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute until it reaches an index `i` where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]`. At this point, the loop will terminate.

From the output states after the first 3 iterations, we know that:
- After 1 iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.
- After 2 iterations, `i` is incremented by 2, and `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1] == arr[i + 2]`.
- After 3 iterations, `i` is incremented by 3, and `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1] == arr[i + 2]` and `arr[i + 2] == arr[i + 3]`.

This pattern continues until `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]`. Therefore, the final state of `i` will be the index where this inequality first holds true. The variable `j` remains unchanged throughout the loop.

**Output State: i is the index where arr[i] != arr[i + 1], and j is unchanged.**

In natural language: The final output state is that `i` will be the index of the first element in the array that is not equal to the next element, and `j` will remain the same as it was in the initial state.
