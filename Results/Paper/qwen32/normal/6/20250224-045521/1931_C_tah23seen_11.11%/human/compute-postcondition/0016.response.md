Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is 1, `j` is -1**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged.
