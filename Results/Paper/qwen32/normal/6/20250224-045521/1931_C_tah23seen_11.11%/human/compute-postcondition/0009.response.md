The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `j`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`. At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `i` and `j` are given based on the condition of the first and last elements of the list `arr`.

If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `i` remains 0 and `j` remains `n - 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `i` is still less than or equal to `j` after the previous iteration. This means that we need to adjust `i` and `j` accordingly.

If `i` is 1 and `j` is `n - 2`, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be less than or equal to `n - 2`. This condition is generally true unless `n` is very small (specifically, `n` must be at least 3 for `j` to be at least 1).

If `i` is 0 and `j` is `n - 1`, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be less than or equal to `n - 1`. This condition is always true for any valid `n` (i.e., `n` ≥ 1).

Given these conditions, we can conclude that the loop can certainly execute one more time unless `n` is 2 and `arr[0] == arr[1]` (which would make `i` = 1 and `j` = 0, thus `i` > `j`).

However, since the problem specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, we can assume that `n` is large enough to satisfy the condition `i <= j` in most cases. Therefore, we do not need to make any specific adjustments to `i` and `j` unless we are in the specific edge case where `n` is 2 and `arr[0] == arr[1]`.

For the general case, we can simply repeat the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `i` remains 0 and `j` remains `n - 1`, and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.**
