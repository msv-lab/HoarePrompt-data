To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop condition is `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. This means that for the loop to execute again, the condition must still be true after the current iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `j` is unchanged (though `j` is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` for the new value of `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr[i]` must still be equal to `arr[i + 1]` after `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]` after the increment.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is unchanged, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `arr[i + 1]` must be equal to `arr[i + 2]`**.
