To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given initial state and the conditions that lead to the output states after the first three iterations.

The loop continues to execute as long as `i <= j`. In each iteration:
- If `arr[i] == arr[j]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is decremented by 1.
- If `arr[i] != arr[j]`, the loop breaks.

The loop will terminate when either `i` exceeds `j` or when `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.

From the given output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration, if `arr[i] == arr[j]`, `i` becomes 1 and `j` becomes `n - 2`.
- After 2 iterations, if `arr[i] == arr[j]` in both iterations, `i` becomes 2 and `j` becomes `n - 3`.
- After 3 iterations, if `arr[i] == arr[j]` in all iterations, `i` becomes 3 and `j` becomes `n - 4`.

This pattern continues until `i > j` or `arr[i] != arr[j]`. The loop will stop when either `i` surpasses `j` or when the elements at the `i`-th and `j`-th positions are not equal.

The final output state will be when the loop terminates, which means either `i` has become greater than `j` or `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.

**Output State: i = k, j = n - k - 1** where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed until `arr[i] != arr[j]` or `i > j`.

In simpler terms, the output state will be when `i` and `j` are such that `i > j` or `arr[i] != arr[j]`.

Since the exact number of iterations depends on the specific values in `arr`, the final output state can be described as:
- `i` and `j` will be such that `i > j` if all elements matched until the end, or
- `i` and `j` will be such that `arr[i] != arr[j]` if a mismatch was found.

Given the nature of the loop, the final state will be when the loop condition `i <= j` is no longer satisfied or a mismatch is found.

Output State: **i and j are such that either i > j or arr[i] != arr[j].**
