Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; if the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is `n - 3`. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is `n - 2`, and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, `j` was initially `n - 2` and is now `n - 3`. If the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`, `j` was initially `n - 1` and is now `n - 2`. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
