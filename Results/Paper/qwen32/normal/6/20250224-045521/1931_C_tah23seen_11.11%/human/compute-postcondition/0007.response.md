Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `i` is 0; `j` is `n - 1`; and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `arr`, `i`, `j`, and the condition that the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
