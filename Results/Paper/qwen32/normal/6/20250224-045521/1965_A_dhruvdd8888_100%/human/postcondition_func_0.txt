The function reads input for multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It processes these integers to determine the outcome of a game between Alice and Bob, printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the processed list. The function does not modify the input values `t`, `n`, or the list of integers; it only outputs the result of each test case.
