Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i` is `i - 1`, and `nums` remain the same. `len(nums)` is at least 3. `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements. If `nums[i]` was 1, `cw` is `False`; otherwise, `cw` is `True`. `nw` is `cw`. If `nums[i]` was 1, `cw` is now the opposite of its initial value; otherwise, `cw` remains `True`.**
