The code snippet provided only assigns the value `True` to the variable `cw`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables as described in the initial state, with the addition that `cw` is now `True`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same; `n` remains the same; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain the same; `N` remains the same; `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements; `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list; `i` will be `len(nums) - 1` (the last index of `nums`); `nw` is `True`; `cw` is `True`.**
