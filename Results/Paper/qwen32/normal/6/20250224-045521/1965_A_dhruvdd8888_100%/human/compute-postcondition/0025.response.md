The code snippet provided flips the value of `cw` by setting it to the opposite of `nw`. Given the initial state, `nw` is equal to `cw`, so after executing `cw = not nw`, `cw` will be the opposite of its initial value.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i` is `i - 1`, and `nums` remain the same. `len(nums)` is at least 3. `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements. If `nums[i]` was 1, `cw` was `False`; otherwise, `cw` was `True`. `nw` is `cw`. `cw` is now the opposite of its initial value.**

In simpler terms, the value of `cw` has been flipped to its opposite, while all other variables remain unchanged.
