The code snippet `cw = True` sets the variable `cw` to `True`. Since the variable `cw` is already `True` according to the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same; `n` remains the same; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain the same; `N` remains the same; `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements; `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list; `i` is `len(nums) - 2`; `nw` is `True`; `cw` is `True`; `len(nums)` must be at least 3; `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.**
