The code snippet `ls += nums[i]` updates the value of `ls` by adding the value of `nums[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `ls` is initially set to `nums[0]`, and `i` is set to 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `ls` will be the sum of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `N` is an input integer; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers obtained from the input string and includes the integer `0`, with `nums[i]` reduced by `nums[0]`; `ls` is `nums[0] + nums[1]`; `i` is 1**
