The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `nums`. Since the loop iterates over the indices of `nums`, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to point to the next index in `nums`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `N` is an input integer; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers obtained from the input string and includes the integer `0`; `ls` is `nums[0]`; `i` is 1**
