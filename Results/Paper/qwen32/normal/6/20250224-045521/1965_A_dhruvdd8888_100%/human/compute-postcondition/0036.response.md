Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t`, `n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, `N`, `ls` are mentioned but their specific values are not provided.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `nums` is a list (though its contents are not specified).
- `nw` is set to `True` if `nums[1]` is not 1, otherwise `False`.
- `cw` is set to `True`.
- It is explicitly stated that `nums[1]` is not 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables listed in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

### Output:
Output: **Alice**
