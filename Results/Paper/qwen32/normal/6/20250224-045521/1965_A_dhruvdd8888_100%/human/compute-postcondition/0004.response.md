Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `N` is an input integer; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers obtained from the input string and includes the integer `0`; `ls` is 0.**

The variable `ls` has been initialized to `0`. All other variables retain their initial values.
