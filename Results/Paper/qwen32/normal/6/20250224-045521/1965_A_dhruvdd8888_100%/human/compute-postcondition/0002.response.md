The code snippet `nums.add('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the set `nums`. The set `nums` initially contains unique substrings from the input string. After adding `'0'`, the set `nums` will include this new element, unless `'0'` was already present in the set.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `N` is an input integer; `nums` is a set of unique substrings obtained from the input string and includes the string `'0'`.**
