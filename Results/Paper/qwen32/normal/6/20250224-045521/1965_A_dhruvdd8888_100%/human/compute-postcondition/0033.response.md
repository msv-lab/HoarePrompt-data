Given the code snippet `nw = cw`, the value of `nw` is being updated to be equal to the current value of `cw`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i` is `i + 1`, `nums` remains the same, `len(nums)` is at least 3, `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements. If `nums[i]` was 1, `cw` is the opposite of `nw` and `nw` is equal to the original `cw`. Otherwise, `cw` is `True` and `nw` is equal to `cw`. `nw` is equal to `cw`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `nw` is now the same as the value of `cw`. All other variables remain unchanged.
