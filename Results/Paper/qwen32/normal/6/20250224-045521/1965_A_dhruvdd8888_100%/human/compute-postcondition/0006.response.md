The code snippet `nums[i] -= ls` modifies the value at index `i` of the list `nums` by subtracting the value of `ls` from it. Given the initial state, `ls` is 0, so subtracting `ls` from `nums[i]` does not change the value of `nums[i]`. Therefore, the list `nums` remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `i`) remain as they were.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `N` is an input integer; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers obtained from the input string and includes the integer `0`; `ls` is 0; `i` is 0**
