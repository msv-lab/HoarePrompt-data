Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity (even or odd) of the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Here's the reasoning behind it:

1. **Game Analysis**: The game is essentially about the parity of the total number of coins. If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins. If it's odd, Alice wins. This is because the game ends when one player cannot make a move, and the player who is forced to face an even total (after their turn) will eventually lose if both play optimally. This is due to the fact that the game state alternates between even and odd sums with each move, and the player starting with an odd sum can always force the opponent into an even sum, and vice versa.

2. **Program Logic**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks the parity of the sum of these coins using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`). If the result is `0`, the sum is even, and the program outputs 'Bob'. Otherwise, it outputs 'Alice'.

3. **Execution Summary**: The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, which aligns with the game analysis. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Given that the program accurately reflects the logic needed to solve the problem, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
