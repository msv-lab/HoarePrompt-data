Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, `test` is greater than 0, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd. Specifically, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, then `a + b & 1 == 0` evaluates to true. Otherwise, if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, then `a + b & 1 == 0` evaluates to false.**
