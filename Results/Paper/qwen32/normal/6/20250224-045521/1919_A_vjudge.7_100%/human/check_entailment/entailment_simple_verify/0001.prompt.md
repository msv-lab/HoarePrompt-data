You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that `t` equals `test`, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input in the last iteration, `test` is greater than 0, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd. The loop has completed all `test` iterations, printing 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, or 'Alice' if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the logic behind the game and see if the program correctly implements that logic.

### Game Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup:** Alice and Bob each have a certain number of coins, `a` and `b` respectively.
2. **Turns and Moves:** Players take turns, starting with Alice. On each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not, and then must remove one coin from their current wallet.
3. **Winning Condition:** The player who cannot make a move (i.e., whose wallet is empty and the opponent's wallet is also empty) loses.

### Key Insight:
The game can be analyzed by considering the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `a + b`.

- **If `a + b` is even:** Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves, ensuring that the game ends with Bob making the last move. This is because each time Alice makes a move, Bob can make a corresponding move, and vice versa. Since the total number of coins is even, Bob will always be the one to make the last move, and Alice will lose.
- **If `a + b` is odd:** Alice can make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, forcing Bob into the losing position where he will eventually be unable to make a move.

### Program Logic:
The given program checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`:
- If `a + b` is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
- If `a + b` is odd, it prints "Alice".

### Verification:
Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:
1. **Example 1:** `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - `a + b = 2` (even), so Bob wins.
2. **Example 2:** `a = 1`, `b = 4`
   - `a + b = 5` (odd), so Alice wins.
3. **Example 3:** `a = 5`, `b = 3`
   - `a + b = 8` (even), so Bob wins.
4. **Example 4:** `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - `a + b = 9` (odd), so Alice wins.
5. **Example 5:** `a = 11`, `b = 9`
   - `a + b = 20` (even), so Bob wins.
6. **Example 6:** `a = 83`, `b = 91`
   - `a + b = 174` (even), so Bob wins.
7. **Example 7:** `a = 1032`, `b = 9307`
   - `a + b = 10339` (odd), so Alice wins.
8. **Example 8:** `a = 839204`, `b = 7281`
   - `a + b = 846485` (odd), so Alice wins.
9. **Example 9:** `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - `a + b = 2000000000` (even), so Bob wins.
10. **Example 10:** `a = 53110`, `b = 2024`
    - `a + b = 55134` (even), so Bob wins.

All these examples match the expected output, confirming that the program's logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
