The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `test` is greater than 0, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to the integers read from the input. The other variables (`t` and `test`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `test` is greater than 0, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd.**
