Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is updated to the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max`; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`; `i` is incremented by 1; `temp` is now sorted in ascending order. If the second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max`, `max` is updated to this second element.**
