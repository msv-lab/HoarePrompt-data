Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer, and if `n` is equal to 2, the current value of `n` remains 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    temp = a[i:i + 3]
    temp.sort()
    if temp[1] > max:
        max = temp[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is updated to the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max`; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is updated to the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max`; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`; `i` is incremented by 1; `temp` is now sorted in ascending order. If the second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max`, `max` is updated to this second element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is updated to the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max`; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`; `i` is 4; `temp` is now the sorted slice `a[4:7]` of the list `a`. If the second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
