The code snippet `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. Given that `temp` is a sorted slice of the list `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, after sorting, `temp` will remain sorted. Since `temp` was already a slice of `a` and is being sorted, the sorting operation does not change the state of other variables such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, or `max`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is 3, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `max` remains unchanged.**
