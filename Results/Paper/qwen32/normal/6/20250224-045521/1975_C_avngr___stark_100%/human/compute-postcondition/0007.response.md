Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer, and if `n` is equal to 2, the current value of `n` remains 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `n` is not equal to 2, the postcondition does not specify any changes to `n`.**
