Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). The initial state for the array length `n` and the array elements `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains unchanged as the code snippet only reads the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(min(a))
        continue
    max = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        temp = a[i:i + 3]
        temp.sort()
        if temp[1] > max:
            max = temp[1]
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is the maximum value of the middle elements of all possible 3-element sorted slices of the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any triplet of consecutive elements in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), n is 5, a is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, _ is x + 3 where x is the value of _ at the end of the previous iteration, and max is the maximum value of the second smallest elements from the slices a[0:3], a[1:4], and a[2:5].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
