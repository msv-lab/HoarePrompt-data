The value of `max` is updated to be the second element of the list `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is the second element of `temp`; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. The second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max`.**
