The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` updates the `temp` variable to be a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 3` (non-inclusive). This means `temp` will contain the elements at positions `i`, `i + 1`, and `i + 2` from the list `a`.

Given the initial state, the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, and `i`) remain unchanged except for `temp`, which is now a specific slice of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is updated to the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max`; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`; `i` is incremented by 1; `temp` is now `a[i:i + 3]`.**
