To determine what will be printed by the `print(max)` statement, let's break down the given initial state step by step:

1. **Input `t`**: This is the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499). It tells us how many sets of data (specifically, the list `a` for each test case) will be processed.

2. **Variable `n`**: It is mentioned that `n` is greater than 2. This indicates that each list `a` will have at least three elements, which is necessary to form triplets.

3. **List `a`**: This list is obtained from the input for each test case. The exact contents of this list are not specified in the initial state, but we know that it contains integers and has at least three elements.

4. **Variable `max`**: This variable holds the maximum value of the second smallest element in any triplet of consecutive elements in `a`. To find this value, we would need to:
   - Iterate through the list `a` and form triplets of consecutive elements.
   - For each triplet, determine the three elements, find the second smallest among them, and keep track of the maximum such second smallest value encountered.

Since the exact contents of the list `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `max`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `max` as described.

Therefore, the output of the `print(max)` statement will be the maximum value of the second smallest element in any triplet of consecutive elements in the list `a`.

Output: **max (where max is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any triplet of consecutive elements in the list `a`)**
