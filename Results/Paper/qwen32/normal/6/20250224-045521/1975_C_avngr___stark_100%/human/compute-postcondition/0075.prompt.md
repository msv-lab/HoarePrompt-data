Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is the integer value from the input, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `max` is 0, and `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration. If `n` is equal to 2, the loop continues to the next iteration without modifying `t`, `a`, `max`, or `_`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition since there is no else part.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    temp = a[i:i + 3]
    temp.sort()
    if temp[1] > max:
        max = temp[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is 3, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is 3, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If `temp[1]` (the second smallest element in `temp`) is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is 3, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is the sorted list `a[1:4]`. If `temp[1]` (the second smallest element in `a[1:4]`) is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to be the second smallest element in `a[1:4]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
