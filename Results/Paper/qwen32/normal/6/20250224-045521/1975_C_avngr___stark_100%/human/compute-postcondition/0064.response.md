Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is 3, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
