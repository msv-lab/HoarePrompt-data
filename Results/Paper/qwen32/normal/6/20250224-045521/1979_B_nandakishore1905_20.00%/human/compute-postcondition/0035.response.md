Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4). 
   - This variable `t` is mentioned in the initial state but is not used in the provided code snippet.
   
2. `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
   - These variables `n` and `m` are not explicitly given numerical values, but we know they are integers derived from some input.

3. `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`.
   - This means `k = abs(n - m)`.
   - The exact value of `k` depends on the values of `n` and `m`.

4. `i` is incremented by 1.
   - This statement (`i` is incremented by 1) does not affect the value of `k` or anything that is printed in the code snippet.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`.
- Since `k` is defined as the absolute value of the difference between `n` and `m`, the output will be `abs(n - m)`.

### Output:
Given that we do not have specific values for `n` and `m`, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **abs(n - m)**
