The value of `q` is calculated as `2 ** (p - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the provided initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`; `i` is incremented by 1; `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string; `p` is the length of the string `l`; `q` is `2 ** (p - 1)`**.
