Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The values of `n` and `m` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input().split()` splits the input into two parts, and `map(int, ...)` converts these parts into integers.
