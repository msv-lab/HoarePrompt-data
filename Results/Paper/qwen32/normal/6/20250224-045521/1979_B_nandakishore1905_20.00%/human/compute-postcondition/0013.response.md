The code snippet calculates the length of the binary representation of `k` and assigns it to `p`. The value of `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and it is given that `k` is not a power of 2 and `l` is the binary representation of `k`.

The only variable that changes is `p`, which is assigned the length of the string `l`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`; `k` is not a power of 2; either `n` is not 0, or `m` is even; it is not the case that `n` is 0 and `m` is even; `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string; `p` is the length of `l`.**
