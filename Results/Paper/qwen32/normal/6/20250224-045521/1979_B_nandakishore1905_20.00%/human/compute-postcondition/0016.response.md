Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`; `k` is not a power of 2; either `n` is not 0, or `m` is even; if `n` is 0 and `m` is even, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is set to 2.**
