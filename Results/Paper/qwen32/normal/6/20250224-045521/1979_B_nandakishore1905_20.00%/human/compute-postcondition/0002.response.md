Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`.**

In this output state, the variable `k` is introduced and is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `m` retain their initial states as described.
