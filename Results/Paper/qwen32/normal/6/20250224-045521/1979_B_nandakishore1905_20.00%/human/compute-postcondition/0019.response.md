The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer value obtained from the input. Therefore, to proceed to the next iteration, we simply need to increment `i` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only variable we need to adjust is `i`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `k` is a power of 2, no further changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `k`. If `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is set to 2. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, no further changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `k`. `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.**

Since the loop iterates based on the value of `i` and the input integer, the state of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` (and any related variables `l`, `p`, and `q`) remains unchanged. Only `i` needs to be incremented.

If `k` is a power of 2, no further changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `k`.

If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, no further changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `k`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
