The code snippet converts the absolute value of the difference between `n` and `m` (which is `k`) to its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. This binary string is then assigned to the variable `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, while `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`; `i` is incremented by 1; `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string.**
