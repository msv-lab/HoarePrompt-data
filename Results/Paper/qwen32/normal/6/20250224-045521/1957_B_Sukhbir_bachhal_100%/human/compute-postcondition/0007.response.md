The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `n` right-shifted by 1 bit, which means `n` has been divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0 after the right shift.

Since `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit in each iteration, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must have been an odd number before the right shift (so that after the right shift, it remains at least 1). Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 before the right shift to ensure it is greater than 0 after the right shift.

State: **`position` is 1, `n` must be at least 2 before the right shift**
