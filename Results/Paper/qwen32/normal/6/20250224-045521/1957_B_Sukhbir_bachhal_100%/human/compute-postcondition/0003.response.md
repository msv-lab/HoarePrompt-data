The provided code snippet only initializes a variable `position` to 0. It does not affect any other variables or the function's input parameters `n` and `k`. Therefore, the initial state remains largely unchanged except for the addition of the `position` variable.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is intended to take two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and `k` is the sum of these integers. The constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, with the first input being the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Additionally, `n` is not equal to 0. `position` is 0.**
