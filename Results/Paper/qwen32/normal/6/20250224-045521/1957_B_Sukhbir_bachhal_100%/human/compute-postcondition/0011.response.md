The code `n >>= 1` performs a right bitwise shift on the variable `n`. Given that `n` must be at least 2, if `n` is 2, the operation will change `n` to 1 (since 2 in binary is `10`, and shifting it right by one position results in `1`, which is 1 in decimal). Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`position` is 2, `n` is 1**
