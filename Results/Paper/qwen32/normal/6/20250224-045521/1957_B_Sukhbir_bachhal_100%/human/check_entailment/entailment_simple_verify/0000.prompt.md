You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1

        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Code

The code is designed to solve the problem by constructing a sequence of non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

#### Key Points:
1. **Single Integer Case (`n == 1`)**:
   - If `n` is 1, the sequence consists of a single integer `k`. This is correct because there is no other integer to OR with, so the number of 1s in the binary representation is simply the number of 1s in `k`.

2. **Multiple Integer Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - The code calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` using the `func_1` function.
   - It then appends `2^counter - 1` and `k - (2^counter - 1)` to the sequence, where `counter` is the position of the highest bit in `k`.
   - The rest of the sequence is filled with zeros.

#### Potential Issues:
- **Maximizing the Number of 1s**:
  - The approach of using the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and then filling the rest with zeros is a reasonable heuristic, but it does not guarantee the maximum number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
  - For example, consider the case where `k` is a number with many 1s in its binary representation, and `n` is large. The current solution might not distribute the bits optimally to maximize the number of 1s in the OR result.

### Example to Test the Code

Let's test the code with the following input:
```
1
4 15
```
The expected output should be a sequence of 4 numbers that sum to 15 and maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. One possible correct output could be:
```
8 4 2 1
```
Here, `8 | 4 | 2 | 1 = 15` and the binary representation of 15 is `1111`, which has 4 ones.

However, the provided code will output:
```
7 8 0 0
```
Here, `7 | 8 | 0 | 0 = 15` and the binary representation of 15 is `1111`, which also has 4 ones. This specific case seems to work, but let's consider another case.

#### Another Test Case:
```
1
3 7
```
The expected output should be a sequence of 3 numbers that sum to 7 and maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. One possible correct output could be:
```
4 2 1
```
Here, `4 | 2 | 1 = 7` and the binary representation of 7 is `111`, which has 3 ones.

However, the provided code will output:
```
7 0 0
```
Here, `7 | 0 | 0 = 7` and the binary representation of 7 is `111`, which also has 3 ones. This specific case seems to work as well.

### Conclusion
While the provided code seems to work for the given examples, it does not guarantee the maximum number of 1s in the bitwise OR for all possible inputs. The heuristic of using the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and filling the rest with zeros is not optimal for all cases.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The code does not guarantee the maximum number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence for all possible inputs. While it may work for some cases, it does not handle all edge cases optimally.
