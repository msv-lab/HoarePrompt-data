The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input.**
