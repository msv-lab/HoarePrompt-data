Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a new list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by `abs(x[i])`; `bullets_used` is 0; `can_survive` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a new list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by `abs(x[i])` and must contain at least one tuple; `bullets_used` is `bullets_used + health`; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a new list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by `abs(x[i])` and must contain at least one tuple; `bullets_used` is `bullets_used + health`; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`; `pos` is `pos_next`; `health` is `health_next`; if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a new list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by `abs(x[i])` and must contain at least one more tuple; `bullets_used` is `bullets_used + health`; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`; `pos` is `pos_next`; `health` is `health_next`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
