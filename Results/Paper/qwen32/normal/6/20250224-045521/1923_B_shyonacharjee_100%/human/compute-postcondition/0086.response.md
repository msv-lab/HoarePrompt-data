Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples based on the absolute value of the first element of each tuple and must have at least two tuples, `bullets_used` is `2 * health_next`, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health_next` (which is `3 * health_next`), `can_survive` is `True` if `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`, otherwise `False`, `pos` is `pos_next`, `health` is `health_next`**

In this output state, the value of `distance` has been updated to `abs(pos)`. All other variables remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
