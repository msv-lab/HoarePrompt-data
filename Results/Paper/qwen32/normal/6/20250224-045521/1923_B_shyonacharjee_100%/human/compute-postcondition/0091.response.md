Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples based on the absolute value of the first element of each tuple and must have at least two tuples, `bullets_used` is `2 * health_next + health`, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `total_bullets_needed` is `3 * health_next`, `pos` is `pos_next`, `health` is `health_next`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains unchanged.**

In simple terms, the number of `bullets_used` has been increased by the value of `health`. All other variables remain unchanged.
