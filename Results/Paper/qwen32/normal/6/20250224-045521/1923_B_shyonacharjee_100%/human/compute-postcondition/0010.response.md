Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by `abs(x[i])` and must have at least one tuple `(pos, health)`; `bullets_used` is 0; `can_survive` is True; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`.**

In this output state, the variable `total_bullets_needed` has been updated to be the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
