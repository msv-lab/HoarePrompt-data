Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a new list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by `abs(x[i])`; `bullets_used` is 0; `can_survive` is `False` if at any point `total_bullets_needed` exceeds `distance * k` for any monster, otherwise `True`.**

Natural Language Description: The variable `bullets_used` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
