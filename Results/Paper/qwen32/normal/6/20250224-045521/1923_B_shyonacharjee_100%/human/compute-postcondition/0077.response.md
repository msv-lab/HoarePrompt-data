Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples based on the absolute value of the first element of each tuple and must have at least one tuple, `bullets_used` is `health`, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is `False`. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains `True`.**

Explanation: The value of `bullets_used` is updated to be equal to `health`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
