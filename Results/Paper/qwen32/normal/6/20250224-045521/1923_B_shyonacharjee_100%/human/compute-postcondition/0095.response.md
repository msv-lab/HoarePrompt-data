Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements, an integer `k`, and two lists `a` and `x` of length `n`. The list `a` contains integers between 1 and 10^9, and the list `x` contains strictly increasing integers between -n and n, excluding zero. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
