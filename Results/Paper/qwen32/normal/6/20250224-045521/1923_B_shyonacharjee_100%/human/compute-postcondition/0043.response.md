Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a new list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by `abs(x[i])` and must contain at least one tuple; `bullets_used` is 0; `can_survive` is `False`; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `health`. Additionally, `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `can_survive` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values.
