Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `s` is a rearranged string with the second half moved to the front, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the original string `s`, and the length of `a` is greater than 1; `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`; `newstr` is equal to `s`. If `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, the condition is met as stated. Otherwise, `isreverse` is equal to `s`.**
