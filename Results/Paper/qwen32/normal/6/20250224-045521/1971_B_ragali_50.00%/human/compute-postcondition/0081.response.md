Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then checks if the string contains more than one unique character. If it does, it prints 'YES' and attempts to print a modified version of the string, which could be a rotated version or the reverse of the string, depending on certain conditions. If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'.**
