Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is updated based on the comparison with `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated accordingly. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1]]` or an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 1. After the if statement, if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[1], 1]`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, no changes are made to `new_segment`.**
