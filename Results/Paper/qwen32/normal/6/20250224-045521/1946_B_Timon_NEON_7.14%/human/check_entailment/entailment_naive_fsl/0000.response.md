Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The code includes three functions, but none of them seem to perform the necessary operations to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.

1. `func_1(number)`: This function simply returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). While this is part of the problem's requirements, it is not enough to solve the problem.

2. `func_2(arr)`: This function seems to be trying to find the maximum sum subarray, but it is incomplete and does not return the correct result. The logic is flawed and does not handle all edge cases, such as arrays with all negative numbers or arrays with zero elements.

3. `func_3(number, quantity)`: This function is not implemented at all and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations, but it is currently just a placeholder.

The main logic to solve the problem involves finding the maximum sum subarray (using Kadane's algorithm or similar) and then repeatedly adding this subarray's sum to the total sum of the array. The provided code does not include this logic, and thus it is incorrect.

To correct the program, you would need to implement the logic to find the maximum sum subarray and then add its sum to the total sum of the array up to k times, taking care to apply the modulo operation at each step to prevent overflow.
