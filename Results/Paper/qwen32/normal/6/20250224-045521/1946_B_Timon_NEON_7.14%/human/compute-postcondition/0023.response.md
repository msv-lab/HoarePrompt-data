Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list. `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `max_segment[0]` has been updated to `arr[0] + max_segment[0]`, which initially is `arr[0] + 0`. Therefore, `max_segment` becomes `[arr[0], 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
