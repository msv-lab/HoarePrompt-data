Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]` and `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` is an empty list and `max_segment` is either `[arr[0], 0]` (if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0) or determined by the comparison logic (if `arr[0]` is less than 0). `segments_variants` is updated to include `max_segment + [0]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1], [arr[0], 0, 0]]` or `[[arr[0], 0, 0]]` depending on its initial state. `max_sum` is -1 and `i` is 1.**
