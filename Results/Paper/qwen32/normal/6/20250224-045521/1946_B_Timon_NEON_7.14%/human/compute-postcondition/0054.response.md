The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. This new segment is formed by concatenating the `max_segment` list with the index `len(arr) - 1`.

Given the initial state, `max_segment` is `[sum(arr), 0]`. Therefore, the new segment added to `segments_variants` will be `[sum(arr), 0, len(arr) - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the last segment of non-negative numbers with its starting index, `max_segment` is `[sum(arr), 0]`, `segments_variants` contains all segments that ended with a negative number plus `[sum(arr), 0, len(arr) - 1]`, and `max_sum` is -1.**
