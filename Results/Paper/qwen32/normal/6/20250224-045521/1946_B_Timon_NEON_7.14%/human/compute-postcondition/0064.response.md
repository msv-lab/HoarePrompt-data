The only objects in the loop head are the variable `segment` and the list `segments_variants`. Therefore, we can only adjust these ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants` list. If there are more elements in `segments_variants` to iterate over, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `segments_variants` to be assigned to `segment`.

Let's denote the current `segment` as `segment_prev`. The next `segment` in the list `segments_variants` would be the element that comes after `segment_prev`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the last segment of non-negative numbers with its starting index, `max_segment` is `[sum(arr), 0]`, `segments_variants` contains all segments that ended with a negative number plus `[sum(arr), 0, len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1, `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants` after the current `segment`**
