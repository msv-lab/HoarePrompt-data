Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2, `new_segment` is `[arr[2], 2]`**

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged as a list of integers with at least one integer. The variable `max_sum` still holds the value -1, and `i` still holds the value 2. A new variable `new_segment` is created and assigned the value `[arr[2], 2]`.
