You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment
                new_segment = []
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                new_segment = [arr[i], i]
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the last segment of non-negative numbers with its starting index, `max_segment` is `[sum(arr), 0]`, `segments_variants` contains all segments that ended with a negative number, and `max_sum` is -1.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: `total_max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum from `segments_variants`.
    if (len(total_max_segment) == 1) :
        total_max_segment = [-1]
    #State: `total_max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum from `segments_variants`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, then `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` retains its original value.
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns `total_max_segment`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it is `[-1]`. Otherwise, it retains its original value.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It returns `total_max_segment`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it returns `[-1]`; otherwise, it returns `total_max_segment` with its original value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `total_max_segment`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it is `[-1]`. Otherwise, it retains its original value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
