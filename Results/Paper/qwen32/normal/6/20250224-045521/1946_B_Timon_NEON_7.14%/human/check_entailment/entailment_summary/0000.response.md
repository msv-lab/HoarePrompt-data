### Reasoning:

The provided Python program seems to be solving the problem as described, but there are some points to consider:

1. **Function `func_1`:** This function correctly returns the remainder of the provided number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This is crucial for ensuring that the final answer is within the required modulo constraint.

2. **Function `func_2`:** This function is intended to find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum. It uses a modified version of Kadane's algorithm to achieve this. However, there are some issues:
   - The function initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` with `[0, 0]`. This can lead to incorrect results if all elements in the array are negative, as it will not properly identify the segment with the maximum sum.
   - The logic for updating `segments_variants` and `max_segment` can be simplified and made more robust. The current logic may not handle edge cases correctly, especially for arrays with all negative numbers.
   - The function correctly returns `[-1]` if no non-negative segment is found, but it does not handle the edge case where the array has all negative numbers properly.

3. **Main Execution Logic:**
   - The main logic calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. It does this by finding the maximum segment sum, then using that sum to calculate the final answer.
   - The formula used for the final answer is `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`. This formula seems correct based on the problem description, assuming `max_segment[0]` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
   - The final answer is then passed to `func_1` to ensure it is within the modulo constraint.

### Correctness:

While the program's logic seems correct in principle, there are some issues with `func_2` that need to be addressed to ensure correctness for all edge cases, particularly for arrays with all negative numbers. Given the current implementation of `func_2`, it may not handle such cases correctly.

However, based on the provided execution summaries and assuming that `func_2` is correctly implemented to handle all edge cases (which it currently does not), the main logic of the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Given the current implementation of `func_2`, there are some edge cases that are not handled correctly. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is questionable.

**Correctness: False**
