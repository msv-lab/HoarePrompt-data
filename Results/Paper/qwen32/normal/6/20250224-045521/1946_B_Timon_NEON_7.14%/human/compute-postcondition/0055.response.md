The code snippet appends `new_segment` with the last index of `arr` to `segments_variants`. Therefore, `segments_variants` now includes the new segment with its starting index and the last index of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the last segment of non-negative numbers with its starting index, `max_segment` is `[sum(arr), 0]`, `segments_variants` contains all segments that ended with a negative number plus `[sum(arr), 0, len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, and `max_sum` is -1.**

In simple terms, `segments_variants` now includes an additional segment which is `new_segment` with the last index of `arr` appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
