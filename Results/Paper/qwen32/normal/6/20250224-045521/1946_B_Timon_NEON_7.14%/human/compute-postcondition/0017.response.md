The code snippet `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` adds the value of `arr[i]` to the first element of the `new_segment` list. Given that `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` is a non-empty list, the first element of `new_segment` will increase by the value of `arr[i]`.

Therefore, the first element of `new_segment` will be updated to its original value plus `arr[i]`. The values of `arr`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is a non-empty list where the first element has been increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is `[arr[i], 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0, and `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
