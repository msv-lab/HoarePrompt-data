Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. If the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`, then `max_segment` remains `[0, 0]` and `segments_variants` is `[[0, 0, -1]]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is `[new_segment + [-1]]`.**
