To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables defined in the loop head, which in this case is only `i`. The variable `i` is used to index into the list `arr` and controls the number of iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer.
- `max_sum` is -1.
- `i` is 1.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(len(arr)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since `i` is already 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted because there are no other variables defined in the loop head.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2**.
