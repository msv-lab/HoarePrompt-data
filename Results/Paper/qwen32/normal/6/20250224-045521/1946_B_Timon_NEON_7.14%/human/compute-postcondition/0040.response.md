The given code snippet appends a new list to `segments_variants`, which is composed of `max_segment` and the integer `i - 1`. The value of `i` is 2, so `i - 1` evaluates to 1. Therefore, `segments_variants` will have a new entry which is `max_segment` with `1` appended to it. The values of `arr`, `max_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2, `segments_variants` includes `max_segment` with `1` appended to it.**
