Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Let's go through the potential problems:

1. **Undefined Function `func_1`**:
   The function `func_1` is used in the code but is not defined. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is executed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `k`**:
   The program attempts to find values of `k` by using the factors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`. However, the logic for determining valid `k` values is flawed. The program checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`, but this does not correctly map to the problem's requirements for `k`.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   The program does not correctly handle all edge cases. For example, when `x` is 1 or when `n` and `x` have specific relationships that require careful calculation of `k`.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider a simple test case to demonstrate the failure:
```
Input:
1
10 2

Expected Output:
4

Actual Output:
Error (due to undefined function `func_1`)
```
Even if we assume `func_1` is defined correctly, the logic for calculating `k` might still be incorrect. Let's manually check the logic:
- For `n = 10` and `x = 2`, valid `k` values are 2, 3, 5, and 6.
- The program's logic might not correctly identify these values due to the incorrect use of factors and the condition checks.

### Conclusion:
Given the undefined function and the potential logical errors, the program is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
