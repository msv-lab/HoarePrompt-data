The provided code snippet only initializes a new list named `output2` and does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the initial state of `func_1` being incorrectly defined and `output1` being an empty list remains unchanged. The only change is the introduction of `output2` as an empty list.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined based on the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, x):` where `n` and `x` are integers such that `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`. `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list.**
