The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. The loop runs as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `x` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

Let's verify if `i` (which would be 3) is still within the range:
- The range is from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- Since `x` is at least 4, `int(x ** 0.5)` is at least 2.
- Therefore, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is at least 3.
- This means `i` can still be 3 and the loop can execute again.

The states of `output1` and `output2` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head's variables.

State: **`i` is 3, `x` is at least 4, `output1` contains the element 1**
