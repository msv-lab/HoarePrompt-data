Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r` and `l` which are integers representing a range within the list `lst`, and `lst` which is a list of non-negative integers. The function also accepts `ops` which is a list that will store the operations performed. The function modifies the list `lst` such that all elements from index `r` to `l` are set to `n`, where `n` is the length of the range `l - r + 1`, and then returns the modified list `lst`.**
