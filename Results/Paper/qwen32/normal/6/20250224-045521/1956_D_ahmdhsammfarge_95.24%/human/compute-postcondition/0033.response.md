Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`, `r` is set to `len(lst) - 2` and `l` is set to `len(lst)`, and `over_sum` is set to `sm` if the new `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.**

Explanation: The value of `sm` has been recalculated to be the sum of elements before index `i`, the sum of elements after index `j`, and the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus one. The variables `i`, `j`, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` may have been updated based on the new value of `sm`.
