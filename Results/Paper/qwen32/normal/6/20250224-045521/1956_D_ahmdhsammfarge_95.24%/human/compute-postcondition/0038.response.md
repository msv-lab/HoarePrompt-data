The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `lst`. If `i` is less than the length of `lst`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not explicitly given, but we know it must have been `len(lst) - 1` for the loop to have just ended.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented by 1. However, since the loop has just ended, `i` would need to be reset to 0 for the loop to start again from the beginning.

State: **`r` and `l` are `[len(lst) - 2, len(lst) - 1]`, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:len(lst) - 2]) + 4` if `sum(lst[:len(lst) - 2]) + 4` is greater than the initial `over_sum`. Otherwise, `r` and `l` remain unchanged, `i` is 0**
