### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided code using the problem description, the annotated code, and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a series of operations where each operation replaces a subarray with its MEX (Minimum Excluded Value). The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. We need to output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

#### Provided Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function is intended to find the best subarray to replace, but it uses a flawed logic to determine this. Instead of calculating the MEX of the subarray, it calculates a sum based on a formula and tries to maximize it. This is not aligned with the problem's requirement to use the MEX value.
   - **Annotation**: The function finds indices `[i, j]` that maximize a sum based on an incorrect formula. This does not align with the problem's requirement to use the MEX value to maximize the sum.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function seems to be recursively adding operations, but the logic is unclear and does not align with the problem's requirements. It does not ensure that the operations are maximizing the sum of the array.
   - **Annotation**: The function recursively adds operations, but the logic is unclear and does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to replace the subarray with its MEX value, but the logic is flawed. It replaces the subarray with the length of the subarray, which is not the correct approach.
   - **Annotation**: The function replaces the subarray with the length of the subarray, which is not the correct approach to maximize the sum using the MEX value.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, the following steps should be taken:
1. Compute the MEX of the entire array.
2. Replace subarrays with their MEX values to maximize the sum.
3. Ensure that the operations do not exceed the limit of \(5 \times 10^5\).

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not follow the problem description and does not compute the MEX value correctly. The code uses an arbitrary sum formula and does not ensure that the operations are maximizing the sum of the array.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. It uses an incorrect formula to determine the subarray to replace and does not compute the MEX value correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
