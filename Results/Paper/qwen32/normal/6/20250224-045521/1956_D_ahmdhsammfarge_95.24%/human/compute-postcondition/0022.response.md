Let's break down the code snippet:

Given:
- `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is `len(lst) - 2`
- `j` is `len(lst) - 1`

The code snippet:
```python
sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
```

This line calculates the sum of elements in `lst` excluding the elements from index `i` to `j` (inclusive), and adds the square of the number of elements from `i` to `j` (inclusive).

Now, let's calculate the output state:

- `sm` is calculated as the sum of elements from the start of `lst` up to, but not including, index `i`, plus the sum of elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst`, plus the square of the number of elements from `i` to `j` (inclusive).

Since `i` is `len(lst) - 2` and `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, the number of elements from `i` to `j` is `2` (inclusive). Therefore, `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is `(2) ** 2` which equals `4`.

Hence, `sm` is:
- `sum(lst[:len(lst) - 2]) + sum(lst[len(lst):]) + 4`
- `sum(lst[:len(lst) - 2]) + 0 + 4` (since `sum(lst[len(lst):])` is an empty sum and equals `0`)

So, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the last two elements, plus `4`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the last two elements, plus 4.**
