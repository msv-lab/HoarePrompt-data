Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list that includes the operations performed, including the new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]`, and `n` is `l - r + 1`.**

Natural language: The variables `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops` remain unchanged. A new variable `n` is introduced and is assigned the value `l - r + 1`.
