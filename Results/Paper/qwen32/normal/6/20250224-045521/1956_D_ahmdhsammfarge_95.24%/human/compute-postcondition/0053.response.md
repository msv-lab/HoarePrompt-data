The code snippet `over_sum = sm` updates the value of `over_sum` to the value of `sm`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**

In natural language: The value of `over_sum` is now equal to `sm`, which is calculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. The values of `r`, `l`, `i`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
