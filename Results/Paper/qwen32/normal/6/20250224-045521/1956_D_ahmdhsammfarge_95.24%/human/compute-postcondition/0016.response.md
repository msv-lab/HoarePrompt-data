Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, `l` is 1 if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `l` remains 0, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4` if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `over_sum` remains the sum of the elements in `lst`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, `j` is 2, `r` is 0, `l` is 2.**

After executing the code snippet `r, l = [i, j]`, the variables `r` and `l` are updated to the values of `i` and `j` respectively. Therefore, `r` becomes 0 and `l` becomes 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
