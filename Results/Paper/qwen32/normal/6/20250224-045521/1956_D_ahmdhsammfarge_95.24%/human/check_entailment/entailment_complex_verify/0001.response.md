### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step based on the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by performing operations that set a subarray to its MEX (minimum excluded value) as many times as needed, up to 500,000 operations.

#### Program Analysis

##### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
- **Purpose**: Find the subarray `[i, j]` that, when set to its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
- **Implementation**: The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates a new sum `sm` as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`.
- **Issue**: The formula for `sm` does not correctly represent the sum after setting the subarray to its MEX. The MEX value is not computed and used in the sum calculation.
- **Annotation**: The annotation confirms the incorrect calculation of `sm` and the incorrect return of indices `r` and `l`.

##### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: Generate operations to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value.
- **Implementation**: Recursively calls itself with the subarray `[r, l-1]` and adds operations to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value.
- **Issue**: The logic for generating operations is flawed and does not necessarily achieve the goal of setting the subarray to its MEX value.
- **Annotation**: The annotation highlights the recursive calls and the incorrect logic for generating operations.

##### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: Set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value and generate the corresponding operations.
- **Implementation**: Adds operations to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value and then calls `func_2` to generate more operations. The subarray is set to the length of the subarray `n` instead of the MEX value.
- **Issue**: The subarray is incorrectly set to the length `n` instead of the MEX value.
- **Annotation**: The annotation confirms the incorrect setting of the subarray and the recursive calls to `func_2`.

#### Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not compute the MEX value and does not generate the correct operations to maximize the sum of the array. The logic in each function is flawed, and the program does not achieve the desired result.

#### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the annotations, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The functions do not compute the MEX value, and the operations generated do not maximize the sum of the array.

### Final Answer
Final: **False**
