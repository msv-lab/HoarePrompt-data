To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the function call `func_2(r, l, ops)`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided snippet, so we must assume what it does based on the given information and typical practices.

Given the description, we can infer that `func_2` might perform some operation using the parameters `r`, `l`, and `ops`. The only specific detail we have is that `ops` will store operations performed, including a new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]`.

Therefore, the only change we can definitively make to the initial state is to add the new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the `ops` list.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed, including the new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]`. The new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` has been added to `ops`.**
