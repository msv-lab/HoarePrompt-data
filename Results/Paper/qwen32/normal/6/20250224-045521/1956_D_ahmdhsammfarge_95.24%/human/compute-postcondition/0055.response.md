To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` evolve with each iteration.

The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` to the end of the list `lst`. For each `j`, it calculates a sum `sm` which includes the sum of elements before index `i`, the sum of elements after index `j`, and a penalty term `(j - i + 1) ** 2`. If this `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, it updates `r` and `l` to `[i, j]` and sets `over_sum` to `sm`.

Given that `i` remains 0 throughout the loop, the loop essentially checks all possible pairs `(0, j)` for `j` ranging from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`. The final values of `r` and `l` will be those corresponding to the pair `(0, j)` that maximizes `sm`.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `r` and `l` will be the pair `[0, j]` that maximizes `sm`.
- `over_sum` will be the maximum `sm` found during the loop.
- `i` remains 0.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **r and l are [0, j] (where j maximizes sm), over_sum is the maximum sm found, and i is 0.**

In natural language: After all iterations, `r` and `l` will be the indices `[0, j]` that result in the highest calculated sum `sm`. The variable `over_sum` will hold this maximum sum, and `i` will remain 0.
