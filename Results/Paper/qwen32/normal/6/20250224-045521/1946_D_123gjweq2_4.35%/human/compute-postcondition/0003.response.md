The code snippet initializes an empty list `new_arr`. This action does not affect the values of `cur_arr` or `bit`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `new_arr` while keeping `cur_arr` as a list of non-negative integers and `bit` as an integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list**.
