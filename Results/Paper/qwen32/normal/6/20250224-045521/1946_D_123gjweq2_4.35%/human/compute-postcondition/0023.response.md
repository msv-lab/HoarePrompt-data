To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop given the initial state and the conditions under which `new_arr` is populated.

### Initial State Recap:
- `cur_arr`: A list of non-negative integers.
- `bit`: An integer such that 0 <= bit < 30.
- `new_arr`: An empty list.
- `xor`: 0.
- `thing1`: 0 (though `thing1` is not used in the loop, it remains unchanged).

### Loop Behavior:
For each element `i` in `cur_arr`:
1. `xor` is updated to `xor ^ i` (bitwise XOR of the current `xor` and `i`).
2. The loop checks if the bit at position `bit` in the binary representation of `xor` is 0 (`not xor >> bit & 1`).
3. If the condition is true, `xor` is appended to `new_arr`, and `xor` is reset to 0.

### Final Output State:
- `cur_arr`: Remains unchanged as it is the input list being iterated over.
- `bit`: Remains unchanged as it is a constant used in the condition.
- `new_arr`: Contains elements from `cur_arr` that satisfy the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` after each iteration.
- `xor`: Will be 0 if the last element in `cur_arr` caused `new_arr` to be updated, otherwise it will retain the value of the final `xor` after the loop.
- `thing1`: Remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.

### Explanation in Natural Language:
After the loop has processed all elements in `cur_arr`, `new_arr` will contain the cumulative XOR values that had a 0 at the position specified by `bit`. The final value of `xor` will be 0 if the last element caused a reset; otherwise, it will be the result of the last XOR operation. All other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, and `thing1`) remain unchanged.

### Final Output State in Specified Format:
Output State: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains elements from `cur_arr` that satisfied the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` after each iteration, `xor` is 0 if the last element caused a reset, otherwise it is the result of the last XOR operation, `thing1` is unchanged.**
