The code snippet `xor ^= i` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and `i`. Given that `i` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `i` is intended to be an element from `cur_arr` as it's a common practice in such scenarios. However, since `i` is not specified, we'll treat it as a variable that can hold any value from `cur_arr`.

Given that `xor` is initially 0, the result of `xor ^= i` will be the value of `i` itself because XORing 0 with any number `i` results in `i`.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is `i`, `thing1` is 0**

In simple terms, the value of `xor` is now equal to the value of `i`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
