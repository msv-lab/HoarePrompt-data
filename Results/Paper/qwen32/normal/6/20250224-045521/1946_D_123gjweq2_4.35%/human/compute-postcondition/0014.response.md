The code snippet `new_arr.append(xor)` appends the value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. Given the initial state, `new_arr` is either an empty list or a list containing `i` based on the condition related to the bit in the binary representation of `xor`. After appending `xor` to `new_arr`, the list `new_arr` will now contain `xor` as its last element.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is the result of the previous `xor` XOR `i`, `thing1` is 0, and `new_arr` is a list that now contains the previous elements (if any) and the new element `xor`. `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
