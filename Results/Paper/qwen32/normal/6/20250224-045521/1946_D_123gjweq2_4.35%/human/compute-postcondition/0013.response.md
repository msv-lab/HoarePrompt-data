Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is the result of the previous `xor` XOR `i`, `thing1` is 0, and if the bit at position `bit` in the binary representation of the new `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing `i`. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list. `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**

Natural Language: The value of `xor` has been updated to the result of the previous `xor` XOR `i`. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `thing1`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The condition for `new_arr` to contain `i` or remain empty is re-evaluated based on the updated `xor` value.
