You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_max(arr, 31)

#Function 2:
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (where 0 <= bit < 30) and recursively determines a maximum value based on the specified bit. If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of `cur_arr`. Otherwise, it partitions `cur_arr` into a new list `new_arr` based on a specific condition related to the `bit`-th bit of the cumulative XOR of elements in `cur_arr`, and then recursively calculates the maximum value between the length of `new_arr` and the result of further recursive calls on `cur_arr` and `new_arr` with `bit - 1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. Let's analyze why it is incorrect:

The main function `func_1` calls `find_max` with `bit` set to 31. This suggests that the function is trying to process the array based on the 31st bit (since the maximum possible value for `x` is less than \(2^{30}\), it would typically involve 30 bits, but the code uses 31).

The recursive function `find_max` processes the array by splitting it into subarrays where the cumulative XOR up to the current element does not have the current bit set. If the cumulative XOR has the current bit set, it starts a new subarray. The function then recursively processes the new subarrays with the next lower bit.

However, the function does not correctly handle the bitwise OR condition specified in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not ensure that the cumulative OR of the XORs of the subarrays is less than or equal to `x`. Instead, it only checks if the cumulative XOR of each subarray does not have the current bit set, which is not sufficient.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2
1 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of the Correct Output:**
The optimal way to split the array is into two subarrays: `[1]` and `[3, 3]`. The XOR of `[1]` is `1` and the XOR of `[3, 3]` is `0`. The cumulative OR of these XORs is `1 | 0 = 1`, which is less than or equal to `2`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will likely return `1` for this input because it will not correctly handle the OR condition and will not be able to split the array into two valid subarrays.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect as it does not handle the bitwise OR condition correctly, and it fails to find the maximum number of valid subarrays for some inputs.
