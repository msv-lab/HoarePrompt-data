Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (all 0s followed by all 1s) using cyclic shifts on any substring and minimizing the total cost. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r-l+1` is `r-l+1`.

### Program Analysis

#### `func_1` Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads a binary string, but it uses `input().split()`, which is incorrect for reading a single string without spaces. It should use `input().strip()` to read the string directly.
2. **Logic**: 
   - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to store the total cost.
   - It iterates through the string:
     - If it encounters a '1', it increments `n`.
     - If it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Output**: The function prints the total cost `ans`.

#### `func_2` Analysis
- This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Check
Let's verify if the logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

**Key Insight:**
- To sort a binary string, all '1's need to be moved to the right of all '0's.
- The cost to move a '1' past a '0' is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one (the cost of the cyclic shift).

### Example Walkthrough
Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement: `101011`.

- Initially, `n = 0` and `ans = 0`.
- First character is '1': `n = 1`.
- Second character is '0': `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (move the '1' past the '0').
- Third character is '1': `n = 2`.
- Fourth character is '0': `ans = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5` (move the two '1's past the '0').
- Fifth character is '1': `n = 3`.
- Sixth character is '1': `n = 4`.

The total cost is `5`, which matches the expected output.

### Issues and Corrections
1. **Input Handling**: The input handling in `func_1` is incorrect. It should read the string directly using `input().strip()` instead of `input().split()`.
2. **Output**: The function prints the result directly, which is appropriate for the problem's output requirements.

### Conclusion
The logic in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string, but there is a critical issue with how it reads the input. The input handling needs to be corrected.

**Final Evaluation:**
Given the incorrect input handling in `func_1`, the program does not correctly read the binary string, which would lead to incorrect results. 

Final: **False**
