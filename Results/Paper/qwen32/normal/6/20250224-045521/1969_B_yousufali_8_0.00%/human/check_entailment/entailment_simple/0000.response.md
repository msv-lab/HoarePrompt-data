### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

The provided program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. 

- `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` reads a binary string `s`, counts the number of `1`s encountered (`n`), and calculates the cost (`ans`) based on the number of `1`s encountered before each `0`.

The cost calculation in `func_1` is done as follows:
- For each `0` encountered after at least one `1` has been encountered, the cost increases by `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of `1`s encountered so far. This is because each `0` needs to be shifted past all the `1`s encountered before it, and the cost of shifting a substring of length `n + 1` (including the `0` and all the `1`s before it) is `n + 1`.

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input: `10`**
   - `n` = 1 (one `1` encountered)
   - `ans` = 2 (one `0` encountered after `1`, cost is `n + 1` = 2)
   - Output: `2`

2. **Input: `0000`**
   - No `1`s encountered, so `ans` remains 0.
   - Output: `0`

3. **Input: `11000`**
   - `n` = 2 (two `1`s encountered)
   - `ans` = 9 (three `0`s encountered after `1`s, cost is `2 + 1` three times = 9)
   - Output: `9`

4. **Input: `101011`**
   - `n` = 1 (one `1` encountered before the first `0`)
   - `ans` = 5 (one `0` encountered after one `1`, cost is `1 + 1` = 2; then `n` = 2 for the next `0`, cost is `2 + 1` = 3; total cost = 2 + 3 = 5)
   - Output: `5`

5. **Input: `01101001`**
   - `n` = 1 (one `1` encountered before the first `0`)
   - `ans` = 11 (one `0` encountered after one `1`, cost is `1 + 1` = 2; then `n` = 2 for the next `0`, cost is `2 + 1` = 3; then `n` = 3 for the next `0`, cost is `3 + 1` = 4; total cost = 2 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 11)
   - Output: `11`

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case, as verified by the examples.

### Correctness: **True**
