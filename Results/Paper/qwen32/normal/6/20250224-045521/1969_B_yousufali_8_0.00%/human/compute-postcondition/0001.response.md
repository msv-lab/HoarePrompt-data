In the given task, the for loop iterates `_` times, where `_` is a throwaway variable that is not used within the loop body. The number of iterations is determined by the variable `t`, which is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `t` so that it is greater than or equal to 1. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains `t`, which determines the number of iterations.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given that `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that it meets the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, we adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
