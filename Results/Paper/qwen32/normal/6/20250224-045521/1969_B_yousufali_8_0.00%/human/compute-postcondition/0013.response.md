Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element. If the current element `s[i]` is 1, then `n` is set to 1 or 2, and `ans` remains 0 or is set to 2 if a previous `s[i]` was 1. If the current element `s[i]` is 0, then `n` remains 0 or is set to 2, and `ans` is set to 2 if `n` was not 0. `i` is incremented by 1 in all cases.

The given code snippet is:
```
ans += n + 1
```

This line of code increments `ans` by `n + 1`. The value of `n` can be either 0, 1, or 2 based on the conditions provided in the initial state.

Let's consider the possible values of `n` and the corresponding changes to `ans`:

1. If `n` is 0, then `ans` is incremented by `0 + 1`, so `ans` becomes `ans + 1`.
2. If `n` is 1, then `ans` is incremented by `1 + 1`, so `ans` becomes `ans + 2`.
3. If `n` is 2, then `ans` is incremented by `2 + 1`, so `ans` becomes `ans + 3`.

The other variables (`s`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element. `i` is incremented by 1 in all cases. `ans` is incremented by `n + 1`, where `n` can be 0, 1, or 2 based on the conditions provided in the initial state.**

In simpler terms:
Output State: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is increased by `n + 1`, where `n` is either 0, 1, or 2 based on the conditions provided.**
