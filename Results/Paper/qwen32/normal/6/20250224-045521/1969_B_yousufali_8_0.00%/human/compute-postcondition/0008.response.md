To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the given information:

- The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, `func_1()` is called.
- The output states after the first 3 iterations are provided, and we know that `t` must be at least 3 for these states to hold.

From the loop code `for _ in range(t): func_1()`, it is clear that `func_1()` is called `t` times. The variable `t` is not modified within the loop, so its value remains the same throughout the loop's execution.

The output state after all iterations would be that `func_1()` has been called `t` times, and `t` remains unchanged from its initial value.

Output State: **`func_1()` has been called `t` times, and `t` remains the same as the initial input integer.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the function `func_1()` will have been called `t` times, and the value of `t` will still be the same as it was when the loop started.
