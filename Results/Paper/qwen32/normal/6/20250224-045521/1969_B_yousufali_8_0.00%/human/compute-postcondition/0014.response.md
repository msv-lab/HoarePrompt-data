Postcondition: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element. `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] == 0` and `n != 0`, then `ans` is increased by `n + 1`, where `n` is either 0, 1, or 2 based on the conditions provided. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
