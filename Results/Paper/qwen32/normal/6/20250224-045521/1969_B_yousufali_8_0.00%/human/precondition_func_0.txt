s is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing a binary string. n is an integer initialized to 0, and ans is an integer initialized to 0. The variable n counts the number of 1s encountered in the list s up to the current index, and ans accumulates the cost based on the number of 1s encountered before each 0.
