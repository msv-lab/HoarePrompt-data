To provide the Output State, I need to know the definition of `func_1()` since it directly impacts the variables and their values. Without knowing what `func_1()` does, I can't determine how the initial state is affected.

However, if you provide the definition of `func_1()`, I can accurately simulate the execution and provide the Output State.

For the sake of this example, let's assume `func_1()` is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1():
    global t
    t = t + 1
```

Given this definition, the code snippet `func_1()` will increment the value of `t` by 1.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and `t` is incremented by 1.**
