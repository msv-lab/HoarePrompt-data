The code appends the string representation of `ans` to the `results` list. The values of `t`, `data[1]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `data`, `idx`, `v`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only change is that `results` now contains the string representation of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original input string, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `data` starting from index 2, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for each `i` where `v[i] >= 2` and `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for each `i` where `v[i] >= 3`.**
