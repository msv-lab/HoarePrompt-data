The code snippet `x = int(data[idx])` converts the string at index `idx` in the `data` list to an integer and assigns it to the variable `x`. Given that `idx` is 2, `x` will be assigned the integer value of the string at index 2 of the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original input string, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**
