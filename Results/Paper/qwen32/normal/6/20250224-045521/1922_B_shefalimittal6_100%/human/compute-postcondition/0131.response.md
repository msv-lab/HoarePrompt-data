Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is between 0 and `n`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided integers.**
