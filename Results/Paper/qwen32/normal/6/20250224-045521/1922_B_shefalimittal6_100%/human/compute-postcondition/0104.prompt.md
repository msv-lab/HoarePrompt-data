Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 3` elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is `2n + 4`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and the string representation of `ans` again, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is `sum(v)`, `ans` is the accumulated sum from all iterations of the loop, `n` is the integer value of `data[2n + 3]`, and `i` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    v[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 3` elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is `2n + 5`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and the string representation of `ans` again, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` being 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the accumulated sum from all iterations of the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2n + 4]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 4` elements where `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is `2n + 6`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and the string representation of `ans` again, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` being 2, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the accumulated sum from all iterations of the loop, `n` is a positive integer and is now `n + 1`, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2n + 5]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 4` elements where `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is `2n + 7`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and the string representation of `ans` again, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` being 3, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the accumulated sum from all iterations of the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2n + 6]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
