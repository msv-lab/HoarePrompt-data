Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `idx` is calculated as `1 + t * (n + 1)`. Given `t` is 0, `idx` simplifies to `1 + 0 * (n + 1)`, which is 1. However, `n` is not defined in the initial state, but this does not affect the `results` list directly.
   - `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` for each of the `t` iterations. Since `t` is 0, there are no iterations, and thus `results` is an empty list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   - `print('\n'.join(results))`
   - The `join` method is used to concatenate all elements in the `results` list, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Since `results` is an empty list, joining an empty list results in an empty string.

Based on this analysis, the output of the `print` statement will be an empty string.

Output: **(an empty string)**
