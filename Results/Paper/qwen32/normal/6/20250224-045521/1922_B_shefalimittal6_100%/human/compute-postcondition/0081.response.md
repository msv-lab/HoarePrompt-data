Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least `0`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where `0 <= a_i <= n`, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 3` elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is `2n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element is the count of the corresponding integer read from `data`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[0] + v[1]`, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to it. All other variables retain their previous values.
