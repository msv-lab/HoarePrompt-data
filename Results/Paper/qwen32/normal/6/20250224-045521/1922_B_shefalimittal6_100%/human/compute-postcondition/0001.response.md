The code snippet splits the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This means that `data` will be a list where each element is a substring from the original `input` string.

Given the initial state, `input` is a string containing the entire input, which includes multiple integers separated by spaces. After executing the code, `data` will be a list of these integers in string form.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 <= a_i <= n; `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original `input` string.**
