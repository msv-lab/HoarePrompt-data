Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the lexicographically largest array `b` is constructed by strategically selecting indices `i` in each of the three-step operations. Instead, it simply adds the modified elements to a set, counts duplicates, and sorts the unique elements in decreasing order. This approach does not consider the optimal order of operations to maximize the lexicographical order of the resulting array `b`.

To achieve the lexicographically largest `b`, Stack should always add the largest possible value to the set `S` in each step. This can be done by selecting the largest element in the array `a` (considering the modification `a_i + i`) in each operation. The program should be modified to implement this strategy.
