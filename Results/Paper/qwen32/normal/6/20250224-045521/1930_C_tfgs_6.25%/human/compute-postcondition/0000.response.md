The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables, including the array `a`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array `a`, and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array `a`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `n` is assigned the value of the input integer.**
