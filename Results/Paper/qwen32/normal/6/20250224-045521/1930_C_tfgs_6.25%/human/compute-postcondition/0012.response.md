The variable `cnt` is assigned the value of `n - len(a)`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, but `counter` is still described as a Counter object that holds the frequency of each element in the original updated list `a` and is no longer accurate for the current `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that holds the frequency of each element in the original updated list `a` and is no longer accurate for the current `a`; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`**.
