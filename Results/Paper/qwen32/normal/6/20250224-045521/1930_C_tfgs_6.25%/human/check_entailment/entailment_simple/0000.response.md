### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

**Problem Breakdown:**
1. **Initial Setup**: We start with an array `a` of length `n` and an empty set `S`.
2. **Operation**: We perform the following operations `n` times:
   - Select an index `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ |a|`.
   - Insert `a[i] + i` into `S`. Since `S` is a set, only unique values are kept.
   - Delete `a[i]` from `a`.
3. **Result Construction**: After all operations, we construct an array `b` which is the sorted version of `S` in decreasing order.
4. **Objective**: Find the lexicographically largest possible array `b`.

**Program Breakdown:**
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.
2. **Transformation**: It modifies each element of `a` to `a[i] + i + 1` (note the program uses `i + 1` instead of `i`, which is consistent with the problem statement).
3. **Counting and Sorting**: It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences and converts `a` to a set to get unique elements, then sorts it in descending order.
4. **Constructing `b`**:
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements, adding them to `ans`.
   - For each pair of consecutive elements, it inserts additional elements between them based on the count of the larger element and the remaining slots (`cnt`).
   - If there are still slots left after processing all unique elements, it appends the smallest possible values to `ans` to reach the required length `n`.
5. **Output**: It prints the constructed `b`.

**Correctness Check:**
- **Transformation**: The transformation of `a[i]` to `a[i] + i + 1` is correct.
- **Uniqueness and Sorting**: The use of a set ensures uniqueness, and sorting in descending order aligns with the problem's requirement.
- **Constructing `b`**: The logic for inserting additional elements between consecutive unique elements and appending the smallest possible values is correct to ensure the lexicographically largest `b`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
