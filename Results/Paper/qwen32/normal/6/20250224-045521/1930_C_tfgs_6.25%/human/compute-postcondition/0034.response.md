Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with consecutive elements having a difference of at least 2, `counter` is a Counter object with `counter[a[i - 1]]` > 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - len(ans) - adv` > 0 if `i > 0` otherwise `cnt` is `n - len(a)` > 0, `ans` is a list containing all the values appended during the loop with `a[i]` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended to it, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])` > 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `ans` now includes an additional element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `j` has increased by 1, and the list `ans` has a new element added to it, which is the result of `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
