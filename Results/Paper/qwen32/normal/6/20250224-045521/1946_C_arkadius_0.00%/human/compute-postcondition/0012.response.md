The method `root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` is called on the `tree` object. This method is likely responsible for setting up or modifying the tree structure, particularly setting the root and possibly performing some form of traversal or processing. Since the exact implementation of `root_tree_non_recursive` is not provided, we can infer that the method will affect the internal state of the `tree` object, specifically setting the root to node `0` and using `-1` as a marker for the root's parent (indicating it has no parent).

Given that the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` remain unchanged and `tree` contains `n-1` edges added from input pairs, we can assume that the method call will not alter the values of `n` and `k`, but it will modify the internal structure of `tree`.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged; `k` remains unchanged; `tree` has been processed with `root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)`, setting the root to node `0`.**
