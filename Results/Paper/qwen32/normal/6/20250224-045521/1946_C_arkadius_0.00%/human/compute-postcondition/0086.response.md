Output State: **`postorder` is not empty, `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one more element that has not been processed, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not been processed yet, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In natural language: The `postorder` list remains unchanged and is not empty. The variable `v` still holds the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, and `postorder` still holds the second element of that tuple before the append operation. The `stack` maintains its structure with as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`. The second-to-last element of `stack` is still `(v, postorder)`. The `tree.vertices[v].children` list still has at least one more element that has not been processed, and `u` is still the next child of `v` that has not been processed yet. The `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been updated to the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been updated to the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.
