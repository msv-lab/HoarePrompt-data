Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tree` representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute, an integer `s` representing the starting vertex, and a non-negative integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component. It returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the vertex `s` in the `tree`.**
