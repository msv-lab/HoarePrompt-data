Postcondition: **`postorder` is not empty. If `postorder` was initially empty, `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the new last element of `stack` is `(u, False)` where `u` is the last child of `v`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have been fully processed. If `postorder` was not empty, no changes are made to `stack` and `v` and `postorder` retain their initial state.**
