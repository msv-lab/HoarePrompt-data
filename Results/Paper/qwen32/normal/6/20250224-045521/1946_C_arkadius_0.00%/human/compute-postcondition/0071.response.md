The only object in the loop head is the variable `u`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[v].children` has more than one element, the loop will execute again for the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `u` was the second-to-last element in `tree.vertices[v].children`. For the loop to execute one more time, `u` needs to be updated to the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

Given that `tree.vertices[v].children` has more than one element and `u` was the second-to-last element, the next `u` should be the last element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

State: **`v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has two more elements than before and the new last element of `stack` is `(u, False)`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have more than one element, `u` is the last element in `tree.vertices[v].children`**
