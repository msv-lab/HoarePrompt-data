Output State: **`v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has two more elements than before and the new last element of `stack` is `(u, False)`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have more than one element, `u` is the second-to-last element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**

In simple terms: The `stack` now has two more elements than before, with the last element being `(u, False)` and the second-to-last element being `(v, postorder)`. All other conditions and variable states remain the same.
