### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Tree Representation and Initialization**:
   - The program defines a `TreeNode` class to represent each vertex of the tree, which includes attributes for edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size.
   - The `Tree` class represents the entire tree and provides methods to add edges and root the tree.

2. **Rooting the Tree**:
   - The tree is rooted using a non-recursive method (`root_tree_non_recursive`) to avoid hitting Python's recursion limit. This method sets up the parent-child relationships and calculates the subtree sizes.

3. **Calculating Good Components and Remaining Size**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` implement a post-order traversal to calculate the number of "good components" (components whose size is at least \( x \)) and the remaining size of components that are smaller than \( x \) for each vertex.
   - The `good_components` count is incremented for each child component that meets the size requirement \( x \), and the `remaining_size` is updated accordingly.

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices. This is done by comparing the `good_components` count with \( k \) and ensuring that the remaining size meets the requirement.

5. **Binary Search for Maximum \( x \)**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) for which `func_3` returns `True`. It iteratively narrows down the range by checking the midpoint value.

6. **Main Function**:
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to determine the maximum \( x \). The result is printed for each test case.

### Verification Against Example:

The program's logic is consistent with the problem description and the provided example. The example input-output pair is correctly handled by the program, indicating that the binary search and component calculations are functioning as intended.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning and the consistency with the problem description and example, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
