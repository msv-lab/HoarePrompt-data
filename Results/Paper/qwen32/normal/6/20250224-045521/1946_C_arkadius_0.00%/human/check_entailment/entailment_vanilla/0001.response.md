Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges from a tree results in each connected component having at least `x` vertices.

### Program Explanation

#### Data Structure
The program uses a `Tree` data structure which is not defined in the provided code snippet. We can infer that this `Tree` class should have methods to handle vertices and edges, and it should be capable of representing a tree structure.

#### Functions
1. **func_1**: This function performs a post-order traversal of the tree starting from vertex `s`. It calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at `s`. A good component is defined as a subtree whose size is at least `x`.
2. **func_2**: This function is similar to `func_1` and also performs a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at `v`.
3. **func_3**: This function checks if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. It uses the results from `func_1`.
4. **func_4**: This function uses binary search to find the maximum possible `x`. It adjusts the range based on the result of `func_3`.
5. **func_5**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`.

### Correctness and Logic
1. **Tree Representation**: The `Tree` class is assumed to correctly represent the tree structure. The methods `add_edge` and `root_tree_non_recursive` are used to construct and root the tree, respectively.
2. **Traversal and Calculation**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` perform post-order traversals to correctly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
3. **Binary Search**: `func_4` uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition. The search range is from 1 to `n`, and the mid-point is adjusted based on the result of `func_3`.
4. **Condition Checking**: `func_3` checks the condition by comparing the number of good components and the remaining size against `k` and `x`.

### Conclusion
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. It uses a combination of tree traversal, dynamic programming (via post-order traversal), and binary search to find the maximum `x`. The assumptions about the `Tree` class are reasonable given the context.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
