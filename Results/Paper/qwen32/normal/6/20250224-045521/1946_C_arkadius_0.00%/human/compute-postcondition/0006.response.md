The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 4, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, an edge is added to the tree between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`, and `i` is 4.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `u` and `v` will be updated to the integers read from the input. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, an edge is added to the tree between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`, `i` is 4.**
