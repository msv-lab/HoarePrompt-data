The only variable in the loop head is `u`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `tree.vertices[v].children`. At the end of the last iteration, `u` was the last element in `tree.vertices[v].children`. For the loop to execute again, there must be more elements in `tree.vertices[v].children` that `u` can take on.

Given that `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element at the start, and since we just finished an iteration with `u` being the last element, for the loop to execute again, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have more than one element, and `u` should be the next element in the list.

State: **`v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has one more element than before and the new last element of `stack` is `(u, False)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have more than one element, `u` is the second-to-last element in `tree.vertices[v].children`**
