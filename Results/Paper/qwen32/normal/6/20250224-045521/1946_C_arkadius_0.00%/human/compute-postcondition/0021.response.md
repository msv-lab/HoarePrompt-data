Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `tree`, which is an object representing a tree structure with `n` vertices, and `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. It also accepts an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed, with the condition that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5. The function returns `beg`, which is the largest value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`.**
