### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` together meet the problem description. Here is a detailed breakdown of each function's role and how they contribute to solving the problem:

1. **TreeNode Class**:
   - Represents each node in the tree.
   - Attributes include `edges`, `children`, `subtree_size`, `parent`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`.

2. **Tree Class**:
   - Represents the tree structure.
   - Methods include `add_edge` to add edges between nodes, and `root_tree_non_recursive` to root the tree at a given vertex.

3. **func_1**:
   - This function processes the tree to calculate the number of "good components" and the remaining size of each component starting from a specified vertex `s`.
   - It uses a stack to perform a post-order traversal of the tree.
   - It updates each vertex's `good_components` and `remaining_size` based on its children.
   - It returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the starting vertex `s`.

4. **func_2**:
   - Similar to `func_1`, this function also calculates the number of "good components" and the remaining size of each component starting from a specified vertex `v`.
   - It performs a recursive post-order traversal of the tree.
   - It returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the starting vertex `v`.

5. **func_3**:
   - This function determines if it is possible to remove `k` edges from the tree such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses `func_1` to get the `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
   - It checks if the conditions are met and returns `True` or `False`.

6. **func_4**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum value `x` for which it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses `func_3` to check the feasibility of each `x` value.
   - It returns the largest value `x` that satisfies the condition.

7. **func_5**:
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it at vertex 0, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum value `x`.

### Analysis:

- **TreeNode and Tree Classes**: These classes correctly represent the tree structure and provide methods to manipulate and traverse the tree.
- **func_1 and func_2**: Both functions perform a post-order traversal to calculate the `good_components` and `remaining_size`. They are logically equivalent, but `func_1` uses an iterative approach while `func_2` uses recursion. The iterative approach in `func_1` is necessary to handle the large input size constraints.
- **func_3**: This function correctly checks if the conditions for `x` are met by using the results from `func_1`.
- **func_4**: This function correctly performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` value using `func_3`.
- **func_5**: This function correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to find and print the result.

### Conclusion:

The program is well-structured and correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Given the constraints and the problem description, the program should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

**Correctness: True**
