The only variable in the loop head is `u`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute once for each child in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not been processed yet.

At the end of the last iteration, `u` was the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` that had not been processed yet. For the loop to execute one more time, `u` must be the next unprocessed child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

Let's denote the list of children of `v` as `children_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `u` was `children_list[i]` for some index `i`. For the next iteration, `u` should be `children_list[i+1]`, provided that `i+1` is within the bounds of `children_list`.

State: **`postorder` is not empty, `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one more element that has not been processed, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not been processed yet. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

Given the above, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `u` is now the next unprocessed child of `v`.

State: **`postorder` is not empty, `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not been processed yet.**
