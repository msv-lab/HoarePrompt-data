Output State: **`v` is the last element of `stack` (first element of the tuple), `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple in `stack`, `stack` has one less element than before.**

In simpler terms, the variable `v` is now assigned the first value of the last tuple that was in `stack`, `postorder` is assigned the second value of that same tuple, and `stack` now has one less element because the last tuple has been removed. The conditions and relationships involving `tree`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size` remain unchanged.
