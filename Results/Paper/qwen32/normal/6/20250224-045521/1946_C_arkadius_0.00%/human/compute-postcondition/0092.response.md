Postcondition: **`postorder` is not empty, `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not been processed yet. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**
