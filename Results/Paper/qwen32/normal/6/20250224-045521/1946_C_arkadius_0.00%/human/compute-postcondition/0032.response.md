Postcondition: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute. If `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v]` has processed all its children, `stack` remains `[]`, `v` is `s`, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component. Each child `u` of `tree.vertices[v]` has contributed to `tree.vertices[v].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` based on the conditions provided. If `postorder` is `False`, `stack` is `[(s, True), (u1, False), (u2, False), ..., (un, False)]` where `u1, u2, ..., un` are the children of `vertices[s]`, and `v` is `s`.**
