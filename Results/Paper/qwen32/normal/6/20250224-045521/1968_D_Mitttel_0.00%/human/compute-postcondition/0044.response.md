To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context and values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is set to 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`. Since `t` is 1, this simplifies to `data[1 + 4(0) + 2n(0)]`, which further simplifies to `data[1]` because `n(0)` is not defined but we can infer it's 0 for the first iteration. So, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `k` is the integer value of `data[2 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, which simplifies to `data[2]`.
- `PB` is the integer value of `data[3 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, which simplifies to `data[3]`.
- `PS` is the integer value of `data[4 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, which simplifies to `data[4]`.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2) - 1]`. This simplifies to `data[5]` to `data[4 + n]` because `t` is 1 and `n(0)` is inferred to be 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 4n(t-2) - 1]`. This simplifies to `data[5 + n]` to `data[4 + 2n]`.
- `index` is `1 + 4t + 2n(t-1)`, which simplifies to `1 + 4(1) + 2n(0)`, which is `5` because `t` is 1 and `n(0)` is inferred to be 0.
- `results` is a list containing 1 result, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

### Key Points:
- `result` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the context, it seems like it should be `results[0]` since `results` is a list containing one result.
- The value of `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

### Output:
Since `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and we don't have the definition of `func_1` or the exact values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `result`. However, we can describe it based on the given information.

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`)**
