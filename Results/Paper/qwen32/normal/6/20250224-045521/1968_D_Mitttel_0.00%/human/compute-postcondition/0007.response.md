Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input. `index` is 1. `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. `results` is an empty list.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` is now the integer value of the second element in the `data` list (`data[1]`). All other variables retain their initial values.
