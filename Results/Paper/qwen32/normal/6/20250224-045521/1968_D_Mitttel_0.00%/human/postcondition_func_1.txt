The function calculates and returns a cumulative score based on a player's starting position in a permutation and a given number of turns. The score is derived from an array of scores at positions determined by the permutation. If a cycle is detected in the permutation, the score includes the sum of scores from complete cycles plus the scores from the remaining steps in the cycle. If no cycle is detected, the score is the sum of scores from the permutation up to the specified number of turns.
