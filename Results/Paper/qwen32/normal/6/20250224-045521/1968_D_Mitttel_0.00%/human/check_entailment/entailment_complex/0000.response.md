### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to determine the winner based on the scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It calls `calculate_score` for both players' starting positions and compares the scores.
   - The function correctly returns 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at `start_pos` over `k` turns.
   - It handles the case where a cycle is detected in the permutation.
   - The cycle detection is done using a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions and the steps at which they were visited.
   - If a cycle is detected, the function calculates the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps within the cycle.
   - The function correctly computes the score based on the rules provided.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided rules.
- All functions work together to process the input and produce the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
