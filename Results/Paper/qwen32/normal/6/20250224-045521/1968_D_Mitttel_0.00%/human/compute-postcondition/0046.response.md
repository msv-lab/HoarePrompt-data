To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, we need to carefully examine the given initial state and understand the values and relationships of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: The value of `t` is given as 1.
2. **`data`**: This is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input. The exact values in `data` are not provided, but we know how certain elements in `data` are used to define other variables.
3. **`n`**: This is calculated as the integer value of `data[1 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`. Since `t` is 1, this simplifies to `data[1]`. However, since `n` is used in the calculation of the index, we need to assume `n` is known or can be derived from the context.
4. **`k`**: This is the integer value of `data[2 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, which simplifies to `data[2]` when `t` is 1.
5. **`PB`**: This is the integer value of `data[3 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, which simplifies to `data[3]` when `t` is 1.
6. **`PS`**: This is the integer value of `data[4 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, which simplifies to `data[4]` when `t` is 1.
7. **`p`**: This is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2) - 1]`. When `t` is 1, this simplifies to `data[5]` to `data[4 + n]`.
8. **`a`**: This is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 4n(t-2) - 1]`. When `t` is 1, this simplifies to `data[5 + n]` to `data[4 + 2n]`.
9. **`index`**: This is calculated as `1 + 4t + 2n(t-1)`, which simplifies to `5` when `t` is 1.
10. **`results`**: This is a list containing 1 result, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

### Analysis:
- The `print(result)` statement is actually `print(result)` but the initial state describes a list called `results` with one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
- Since `results` is a list with one element, `result` is not directly defined in the initial state. It seems like there might be a typo in the print statement, and it should be `print(results[0])` to print the single element in the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
The `print(result)` statement, as given, seems incorrect based on the initial state. However, if we assume the intention was to print the single element in the `results` list, the output would be the value returned by the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

Output: **results[0] (where results[0] is the value returned by func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a))**
