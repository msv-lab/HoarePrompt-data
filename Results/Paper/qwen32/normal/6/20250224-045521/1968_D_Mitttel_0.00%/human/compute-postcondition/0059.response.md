The code snippet `current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]` updates the value of `current_pos` to the value at the index `current_pos - 1` in the permutation array `p`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`score` is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`; `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`; `steps` is the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle; `visited` is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited; `cycle_start` is the step at which a cycle begins; `cycle_length` is `CL`; `cycle_score` is 90; `cycle_pos` is 1; `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`; `full_cycles` is `(k - steps) // CL`; `remainder_steps` is greater than 0.**
