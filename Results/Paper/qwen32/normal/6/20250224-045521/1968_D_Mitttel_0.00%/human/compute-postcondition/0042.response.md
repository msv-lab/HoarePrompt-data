To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

### Key Observations:
1. **Loop Iterations**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
2. **Index Update**: The `index` variable is updated by adding `4 + 2n` after each iteration.
3. **Results Collection**: The `results` list collects the result of `func_1` for each iteration.

### Generalizing the Pattern:
- After the 1st iteration: `index` becomes `5 + 2n`.
- After the 2nd iteration: `index` becomes `9 + 4n`.
- After the 3rd iteration: `index` becomes `13 + 6n`.

Following this pattern, after `t` iterations, the `index` will be:
\[ \text{index} = 1 + 4t + 2n(t-1) \]

### Final Output State:
- **n, k, PB, PS, p, a**: These variables will be the values corresponding to the last iteration.
- **data**: Remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
- **index**: Calculated as described above.
- **t**: Will be 0 because all iterations are completed.
- **results**: Will contain `t` results, each being the value returned by `func_1` for each iteration.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **n is the integer value of data[1 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)], k is the integer value of data[2 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)], PB is the integer value of data[3 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)], PS is the integer value of data[4 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)], p is a list of n integers from data[5 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)] to data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2) - 1], a is a list of n integers from data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2)] to data[5 + 4(t-1) + 4n(t-2) - 1], data is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, index is 1 + 4t + 2n(t-1), t is 0, results is a list containing t results, each the value returned by func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the state will be such that:
- `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` will hold the values corresponding to the last set of inputs processed in the final iteration.
- `data` will remain unchanged as it is the list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
- `index` will be calculated based on the number of iterations `t` and the values of `n` from the previous iterations.
- `t` will be 0 because all iterations have been completed.
- `results` will be a list containing the results of `func_1` for each iteration.
