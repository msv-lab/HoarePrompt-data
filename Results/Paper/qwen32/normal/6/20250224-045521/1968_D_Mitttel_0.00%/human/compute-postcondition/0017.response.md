The code snippet appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, and since this function call is not provided, we can only state that `result` has been added to `results`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5]` to `data[5 + n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + n]` to `data[5 + 2n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `5 + 2n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.
