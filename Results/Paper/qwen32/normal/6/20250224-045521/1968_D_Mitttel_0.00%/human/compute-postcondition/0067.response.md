Postcondition: **`score` is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where either the steps reach `k` or a cycle is detected. If a cycle is detected (`cycle_start != -1`), `score` includes `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus the scores of the first `remainder_steps` positions in the cycle. `current_pos` is the final position in the permutation before the loop terminates. `steps` is the step at which the loop terminates, either due to reaching `k` or detecting a cycle. `visited` is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited. `cycle_start` is the step at which a cycle begins, or -1 if no cycle is detected. `cycle_length` is `CL`, `cycle_score` is 90, `cycle_pos` is 1, `remaining_steps` is 0, and `full_cycles` is `(k - steps) // CL`. If no cycle is detected, `cycle_start` remains -1 and `full_cycles` and `remainder_steps` are not applicable.**
