The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the loop. However, the loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0. Since the loop will decrement `t` by 1 at the beginning of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to decrement `t` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + 2n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[7 + 2n]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[8 + 2n]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[9 + 2n]` to `data[9 + 3n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `9 + 4n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the value of `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**
