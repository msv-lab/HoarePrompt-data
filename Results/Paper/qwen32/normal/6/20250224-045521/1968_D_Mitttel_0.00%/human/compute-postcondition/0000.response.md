The provided Python code snippet only includes `input = sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, or `a`. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and the array, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array. `input` is the entire input from the standard input.**
