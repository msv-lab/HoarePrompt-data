### Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is responsible for comparing the scores of Bodya and Sasha and determining the winner. It correctly calls `calculate_score` for both players and compares the scores to determine the winner or if it's a draw.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**: This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position. It correctly follows the rules of the game by:
   - Adding the score from the current position.
   - Moving to the next position based on the permutation.
   - Detecting cycles in the permutation to avoid infinite loops.
   - Calculating the score for complete cycles and remaining steps if a cycle is detected.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles input reading and test case processing. It reads the input, processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters, and prints the results. It correctly handles multiple test cases and ensures that the input is parsed correctly.

### Conclusion:
All functions together meet the requirements of the problem description. They correctly handle the input, compute the scores based on the game rules, and determine the winner. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
