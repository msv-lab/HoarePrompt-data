Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5]` to `data[5 + n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + n]` to `data[5 + 2n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `5 + 2n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.

The code calls the function `func_1` with the provided arguments and assigns its return value to the variable `result`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.
