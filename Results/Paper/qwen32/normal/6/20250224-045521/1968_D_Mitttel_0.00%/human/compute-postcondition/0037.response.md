The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `data`, `t`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[9 + 4n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[10 + 4n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `13 + 4n + n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the value of `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.

In simpler terms, `index` has been increased by `n`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
