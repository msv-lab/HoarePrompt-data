Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `score` is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected plus `full_cycles * cycle_score`; `current_pos` is the final position in the permutation before the loop terminates; `steps` is the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle; `visited` is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited; `cycle_start` is the step at which a cycle begins; `cycle_length` is `CL`; `cycle_score` is 90; `cycle_pos` is 1; `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`; `full_cycles` is `(k - steps) // CL`; `remainder_steps` is `(k - steps) % CL`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(remainder_steps):
    score += a[current_pos - 1]
    current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `score` is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`; `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`; `steps` is the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle; `visited` is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited; `cycle_start` is the step at which a cycle begins; `cycle_length` is `CL`; `cycle_score` is 90; `cycle_pos` is 1; `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`; `full_cycles` is `(k - steps) // CL`; `remainder_steps` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `score` is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`; `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`; `steps` is the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle; `visited` is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited; `cycle_start` is the step at which a cycle begins; `cycle_length` is `CL`; `cycle_score` is 90; `cycle_pos` is 1; `remaining_steps` is 1; `full_cycles` is `(k - steps) // CL`; `remainder_steps` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `score` is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`; `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`; `steps` is the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle; `visited` is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited; `cycle_start` is the step at which a cycle begins; `cycle_length` is `CL`; `cycle_score` is 90; `cycle_pos` is 1; `remaining_steps` is 0; `full_cycles` is `(k - steps) // CL`; `remainder_steps` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
