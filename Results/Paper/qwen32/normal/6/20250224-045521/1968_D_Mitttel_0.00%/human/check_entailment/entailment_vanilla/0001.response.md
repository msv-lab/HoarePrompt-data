Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the inputs `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It initializes the score and the current position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions visited and the number of steps taken to reach them.
   - It iterates until `k` steps are taken or a cycle is detected.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by determining how many full cycles can be completed and the remaining steps after full cycles.
   - It returns the final score.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads all input data at once and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case and appends the result to a list.
   - It prints all results after processing all test cases.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Global Variable `k`**:
   - The variable `k` is used within the `calculate_score` function, but it is not passed as a parameter to this function.
   - This means that `k` must be a global variable, which is not defined anywhere in the provided code.
   - This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Indexing Off-by-One Error**:
   - The program uses `current_pos - 1` to index into the arrays `a` and `p`.
   - This is correct if the positions in the permutation are 1-based, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - However, this should be explicitly checked and ensured by the logic.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is designed to handle up to 10^4 test cases with a total of 2 * 10^5 elements in the permutation and array.
   - The logic to detect cycles and calculate scores efficiently handles large values of `k` by optimizing the number of calculations after a cycle is detected.
   - This part of the program seems correct and efficient.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, particularly the undefined global variable `k`, the program is not correct as it stands.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
