### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the rules and conditions given. Here is a detailed analysis of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The `func_2` function reads the input and processes it into test cases. It correctly handles multiple test cases and extracts the required parameters (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`) for each test case.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The `calculate_score` function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position (`start_pos`). It iterates through the permutation `p` up to `k` steps, adding the corresponding values from array `a` to the score.
   - If a cycle is detected in the permutation (i.e., a position is revisited), the function calculates the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps within the cycle to efficiently compute the total score without unnecessary iterations.

3. **Comparison of Scores**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function. It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles large inputs efficiently by using a dictionary to detect cycles and by calculating scores in a way that avoids unnecessary computations.
   - It also correctly processes cases where the number of turns `k` is very large by leveraging cycle detection.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the results for each test case in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all specified constraints and edge cases. The provided code is efficient and should work correctly for the given problem description and constraints.
