The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because the loop iterates `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `t` is already given as the integer value of `data[0]`, so we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and the array, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input. `index` is 1. `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. `results` is an empty list.**
