Output State: **`score` is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected plus `full_cycles * cycle_score`; `current_pos` is the final position in the permutation before the loop terminates; `steps` is the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle; `visited` is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited; `cycle_start` is the step at which a cycle begins; `cycle_length` is `CL`; `cycle_score` is 90; `cycle_pos` is 1; `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`; `full_cycles` is `(k - steps) // CL`; `remainder_steps` is `(k - steps) % CL`.**

In simpler terms, the `score` has been updated by adding the product of `full_cycles` and `cycle_score` to it. All other variables retain their previous values.
