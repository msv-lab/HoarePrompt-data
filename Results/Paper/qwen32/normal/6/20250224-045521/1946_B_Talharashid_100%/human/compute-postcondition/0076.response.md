The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` compares the current values of `c` and `maxi` and assigns the larger of the two to `maxi`. Given the initial state where both `c` and `maxi` are 0, the comparison will result in `maxi` remaining 0.

Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`.**
