Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` ≤ abs(`ele`), `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `c`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and its previous value.**
