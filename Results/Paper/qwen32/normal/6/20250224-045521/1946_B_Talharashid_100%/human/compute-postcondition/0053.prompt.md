Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is 0; `maxi` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele` and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `c`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele` and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of the updated `c` and its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of the updated `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
