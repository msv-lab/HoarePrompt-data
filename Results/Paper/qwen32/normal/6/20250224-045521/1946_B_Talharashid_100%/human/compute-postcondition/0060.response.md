The value of `maxi` is set to 0. The other variables (`c`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
