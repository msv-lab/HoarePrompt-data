The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. This operation does not affect the variables `c`, `maxi`, `i`, `n`, or `k` directly, as they are not involved in the operation. The list `l` is newly created and populated with the input values.

Output State: **`c` is the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in `l` (or 0 if the last element in `l` is negative and `c` was reset); `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
