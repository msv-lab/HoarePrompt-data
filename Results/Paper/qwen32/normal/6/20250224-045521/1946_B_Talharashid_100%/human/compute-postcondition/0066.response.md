`c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. The values of `maxi`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The condition that either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele` is still valid after the execution.

Output State: **`c` is `c` + `ele`, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, and either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`.**
