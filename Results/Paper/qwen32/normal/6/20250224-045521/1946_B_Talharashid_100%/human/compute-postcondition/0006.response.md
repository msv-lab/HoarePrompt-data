Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer; `ele` is an integer that is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`; `c` is 0; `maxi` is 0. The current value of `c` is updated to a value less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**
