Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in `l` (or 0 if the last element in `l` is negative and `c` was reset); `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers (or 0 if the final element resets `c`); `maxi` is the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `l` is the list of integers from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
