The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ele` (which is the second element in the list `l`). The values of `maxi`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is `ele`, `maxi` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, and `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements.

Output State: **`c` is `ele`, `maxi` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements**.
