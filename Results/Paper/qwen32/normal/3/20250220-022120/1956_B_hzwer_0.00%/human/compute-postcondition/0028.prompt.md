Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is `0`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`. Other elements of `dp` remain `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and `j` is decremented by 1 from its current value. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Otherwise, if `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. If `cards.count(j + 1) > 1`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
