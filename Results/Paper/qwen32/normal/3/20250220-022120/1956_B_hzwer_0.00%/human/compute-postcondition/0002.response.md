The code snippet initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, where each element is initially set to `0`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from the input, representing the number of cards in the current test case; `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, representing the sequence of cards; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0`.**
