Output State: **`n` is the integer read from the input, representing the number of cards in the current test case; `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, representing the sequence of cards. The number of test cases `t` and the sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are still to be read and are not affected by this line of code.**

In natural language: The variable `cards` is now a list of integers that were read from the input, representing the sequence of cards. The value of `n` remains the same, representing the number of cards. The number of test cases `t` and the subsequent sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are still to be read and are unaffected by this line of code.
