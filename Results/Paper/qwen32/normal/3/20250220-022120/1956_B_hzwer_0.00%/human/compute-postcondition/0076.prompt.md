Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. Specifically, `i` ranges from `n - 3` down to `0`, and `j` ranges from `n - 1` down to `0`. For each `dp[i][j]`, if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is `0`, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the count is `1`, `dp[i][j]` is `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`. The initial values of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` remain `0`, and all other elements of `dp` are updated according to the loop logic. `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, `dp[1][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 1]`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, `dp[1][n - 1]` is updated to `max(dp[2][n - 1], dp[3][n - 2] + 1)`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1, `dp[1][n - 1]` is recalculated to be `max(dp[2][n - 1], dp[3][n - 2] + 1, dp[2][n - 2] + 1, dp[2][n - 1])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 2`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, `dp[1][n - 2]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 2]`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, `dp[1][n - 2]` is updated to `max(dp[2][n - 2], dp[3][n - 3] + 1)`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1, `dp[1][n - 2]` is recalculated to be `max(dp[2][n - 2], dp[3][n - 3] + 1, dp[2][n - 3] + 1, dp[2][n - 2])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, `dp[1][n - 3]` is set to `dp[2][n - 3]`. Otherwise, `dp[1][n - 3]` is the maximum value among `dp[2][n - 3]`, `dp[3][n - 4] + 1`, and if `cards.count(j + 1) > 1`, also `dp[2][n - 2]`. `i` is 1 and `j` is `n - 3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
