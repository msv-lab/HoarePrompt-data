The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is `n - 1`, the specific value `dp[1][n - 1]` is now equal to `dp[2][n - 1]`. The other variables and the `dp` table remain unchanged except for this specific entry.

Output State: **`dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body, `dp[1][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 1]`, `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, and the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0.**
