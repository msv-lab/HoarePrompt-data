The code snippet `ans += i` adds the value of `i` to the variable `ans`. The values of `t`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `tmp` remain unchanged, and `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the previous `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the previous `i`, and `ans` is increased by the value of `i`.**
