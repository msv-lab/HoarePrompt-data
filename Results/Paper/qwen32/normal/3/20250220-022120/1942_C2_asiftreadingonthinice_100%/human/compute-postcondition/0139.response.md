The code snippet provided sorts the list `tmp`. Since `tmp` contains specific calculated values, sorting it will arrange these values in ascending order. The values of `ans`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged as per the description.

Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the count of differences of 2 in `a`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their input values, `a` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is sorted containing `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for even differences not equal to 2. Additionally, if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 but is even, `tmp` also contains `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.**
