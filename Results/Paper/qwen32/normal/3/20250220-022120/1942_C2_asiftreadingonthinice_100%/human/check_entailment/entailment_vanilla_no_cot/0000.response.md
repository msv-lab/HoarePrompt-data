Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible test cases. The logic for calculating the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake is flawed. Specifically, the approach for handling the gaps between chosen vertices and the circular nature of the polygon is incorrect.

Here are a few key issues with the program:
1. The program incorrectly assumes that gaps of 2 between chosen vertices always allow for an additional triangle.
2. The handling of the circular nature of the polygon (i.e., the gap between the last and first chosen vertex) is not correctly incorporated.
3. The logic for using the additional `y` vertices to maximize the number of triangles is incorrect and overly simplistic.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that correctly handles the circular nature of the polygon and optimally places additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
