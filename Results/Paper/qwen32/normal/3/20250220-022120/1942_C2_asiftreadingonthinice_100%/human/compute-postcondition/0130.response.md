Postcondition: **`ans` is updated based on the difference between the 3rd and 2nd elements of `a`. If the difference is 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. If the difference is even and not equal to 2, `ans` is set to `x + y - 2 + 1` and `tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. If the difference is odd, `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their input values, `a` remains a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 3.**
