The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `p`. This operation does not affect the values of `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, or `ps` directly. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input.**
