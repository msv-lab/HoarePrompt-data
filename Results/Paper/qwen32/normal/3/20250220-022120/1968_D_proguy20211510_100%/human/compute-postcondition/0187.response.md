Postcondition: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`, `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`, and the current value of `ress` is greater than `resb`.**
