Output State: **`i` is 2, `paths` is a list with at least 2 elements, `preb` is the sum of `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` across all iterations, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `i`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress`, `pres`, and `curr` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program exits the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
