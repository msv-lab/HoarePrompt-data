Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program contains a logical error in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the situation where the player can stay in the same position or move to `p_x` on each turn. The program assumes that the player will always move to the next position in the cycle and does not account for the possibility of staying in the same position to maximize the score.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program correctly detects cycles for both Bodya and Sasha by following the permutation `p` until a repeated position is found.
   - However, the program does not account for the possibility of staying in the same position to maximize the score.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the score for each player by summing up the values of `a` for the positions they visit.
   - The program considers the possibility of staying in the same position only implicitly by the condition `if k < i + 1: break`, which stops the summation if the number of turns `k` is less than the number of positions visited so far.
   - However, the program does not explicitly calculate the optimal score considering the possibility of staying in the same position to maximize the score.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The optimal strategy for each player is to maximize their score by either staying in the same position or moving to the next position in the cycle.
   - The program does not correctly handle this strategy, especially when the number of turns `k` is large and the cycle length is small. In such cases, the player might stay in the same position to maximize the score.

**Example Case:**

Consider the following test case:

```
1
4 5 1 1
2 3 4 1
1 100 1 1
```

- **Bodya's Path:** Starts at position 1, moves to position 2, then to position 3, then to position 4, and finally back to position 1.
- **Sasha's Path:** Same as Bodya's path.
- **Scores Calculation:**
  - Bodya's score: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 100 = 104` (staying at position 1 on the 5th turn).
  - Sasha's score: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 100 = 104` (staying at position 1 on the 5th turn).

The correct output should be "Draw", but the program might not correctly handle the case where the player can stay in the same position to maximize the score.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for maximizing the score by staying in the same position.
