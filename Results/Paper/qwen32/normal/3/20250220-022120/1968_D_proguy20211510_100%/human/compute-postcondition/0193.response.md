The loop head in the provided `for` loop only contains the loop variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program other than serving as a counter for the number of iterations. The loop runs for a number of times specified by the user input, and the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body.

Given this, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration does not require any adjustments to variables that are part of the loop head. The variables `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` are not part of the loop head and thus their states should remain as described from the previous iteration.

Here is the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, and `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`. If `resb` was originally greater than `ress`, `resb` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `resb` is updated to the value of `ress`**.
