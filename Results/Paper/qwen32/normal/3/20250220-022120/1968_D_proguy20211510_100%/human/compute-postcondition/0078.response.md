Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `paths` is a list with at least 1 element, `preb` is the sum of `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` across all iterations, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `ress` and `curr`, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, and `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
