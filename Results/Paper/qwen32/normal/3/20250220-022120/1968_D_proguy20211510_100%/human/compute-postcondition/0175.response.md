Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements of `pathb` up to the point where `k < i + 1`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `paths` must have at least one element. If `k < i + 1`, the loop or conditional block is exited. Otherwise, no change occurs regarding `k`. `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simple terms: The value of `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged unless further operations are performed on them in subsequent code.
