t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each testcase, n, k, P_B, and P_S are positive integers such that (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). p is a list of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation. a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
