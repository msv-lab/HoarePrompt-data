The given initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any of these variables. The statement is simply:

```python
print('Draw')
```

This means that regardless of the values of `i`, `pres`, `ress`, `preb`, `resb`, `paths`, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` (before the final update), and `pres` (before the final update), the output of the `print` statement will always be the string `'Draw'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **Draw**
