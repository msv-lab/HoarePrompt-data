The given code snippet modifies the list `vis` by setting the element at index `ps - 1` to 1. This means that the initial state of `vis` being a list of zeros with length `n` is updated to have a 1 at the position `ps - 1`. The other variables (`pathb`, `pb`, and `n`) are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 1; the loop breaks when `vis[pb - 1] == 1`; `pathb` will contain the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `pb` will be the value that causes the cycle detection.**
