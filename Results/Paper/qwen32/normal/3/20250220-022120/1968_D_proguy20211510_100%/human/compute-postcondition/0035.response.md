Postcondition: **`vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, a cycle is detected, the loop breaks, `pathb` contains the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` until the cycle is detected, `pb` is the value that causes the cycle detection, `paths` includes `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is not 1, no action is taken and the loop continues.**
