The code snippet `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` to the value of the element in the list `p` at the index `ps - 1`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ps`. The new value of `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0] to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb`, `resb`, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]`, `pathb` is a list containing all elements `a[pb - 1]` until a cycle is detected.**
