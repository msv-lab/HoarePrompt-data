Output State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]` three times, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement because `vis[pb - 1]` is 1.
