The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state describes a series of variables and their values or conditions, but none of these variables are directly used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply outputting the literal string `'Draw'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('Draw')` statement is executed.
2. The string `'Draw'` is passed to the `print` function.
3. The `print` function outputs the string `'Draw'` to the console.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Draw**
