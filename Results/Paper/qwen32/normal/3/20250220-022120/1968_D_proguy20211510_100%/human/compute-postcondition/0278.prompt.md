Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: vis[pb - 1] is 0, vis[ps - 1] is 1, resb is the maximum value of curr computed during the iterations, ress is 0, preb is the sum of the first i elements of pathb where i is the number of iterations completed, pres is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is the index that causes the loop to terminate, ps is the initial ps, p is a list of integers from the input, a is a list of integers from the input, pathb is a list containing the elements from a corresponding to the indices in the cycle, paths is a list containing three elements, all equal to a[ps - 1].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `preb` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `pathb` where `i` is the number of iterations completed, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is the initial `ps`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the elements from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, `paths` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `preb` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `pathb` where `i` is the number of iterations completed, `pres` is `pres + a[ps - 1]`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is the initial `ps`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the elements from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, `paths` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, and `i` is `i + 1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `preb` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `pathb` where `i` is the number of iterations completed, `pres` is `pres + a[ps - 1]`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is the initial `ps`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the elements from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, `paths` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[2] * (k - 2)`, `i` is 2. If `k < 3`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
