The code snippet reads four values from the input and splits them into the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. These variables are initially undefined in the initial state, but after the code execution, they will hold the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\); `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are strings representing the values provided by the input.**
