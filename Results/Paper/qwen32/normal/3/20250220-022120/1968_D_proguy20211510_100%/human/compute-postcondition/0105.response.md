The code snippet `vis[pb - 1] = 1` sets the element at index `pb - 1` in the list `vis` to 1. Given the initial state, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros. Therefore, after executing this line, the element at index `pb - 1` in `vis` will be 1, and all other elements will remain 0.

Output State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1, `preb`, `resb`, `ps`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**
