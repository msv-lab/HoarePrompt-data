Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in calculating the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case where the number of turns `k` is greater than the length of the cycle in the permutation. The program calculates the score assuming that the player can stay in the same position after completing a cycle, but it does not account for the possibility of the player continuing to move within the cycle after completing one full cycle.

Here is a detailed explanation of the issue:

1. **Cycle Detection**: The program correctly identifies cycles for both Bodya and Sasha.
2. **Score Calculation**: However, when calculating the score, it only considers the first `k` turns without accounting for the possibility of the player continuing to move within the cycle after completing one full cycle.

To fix this, the program should:
- Calculate the sum of the cycle.
- Determine the number of complete cycles within `k` turns.
- Calculate the score for the remaining turns after completing the full cycles.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def calculate_score(start):
            path = []
            seen = [0] * n
            seen[start - 1] = 1
            current = start
            while True:
                path.append(a[current - 1])
                current = p[current - 1]
                if seen[current - 1] == 1:
                    break
                seen[current - 1] = 1
            
            cycle_length = len(path)
            cycle_sum = sum(path)
            full_cycles = k // cycle_length
            remaining_turns = k % cycle_length
            
            # Calculate the score for the full cycles
            score = full_cycles * cycle_sum
            
            # Calculate the score for the remaining turns
            for i in range(remaining_turns):
                score += path[i]
            
            return score
        
        resb = calculate_score(pb)
        ress = calculate_score(ps)
        
        if resb > ress:
            print('Bodya')
        elif ress > resb:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

This corrected version properly handles the cycles and calculates the scores accordingly.
