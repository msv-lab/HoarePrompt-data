To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`. This means that the loop will execute if `len(set_)` is greater than 1, because `range(1, len(set_))` will generate at least one value if `len(set_)` is greater than 1.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile.
- `A` is False.
- `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1.
- `not_c` is True.

We need to ensure that `len(set_)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The initial state mentions that the first element of `set_` is 1, which means `set_` already contains at least one element. To make sure the loop executes, we need to add at least one more unique element to `set_`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `set_` contains more than one element.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile; `A` is False; `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1, and `set_` must contain at least one more unique element; `not_c` is True**. 

To make it more concrete and clear:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile; `A` is False; `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1, and `set_` must contain at least one more unique element (e.g., `set_` could be [1, 2]); `not_c` is True**.
