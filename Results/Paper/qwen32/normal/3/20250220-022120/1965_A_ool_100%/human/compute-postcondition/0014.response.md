The code snippet provided simply sets the variable `not_c` to `False`. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile; `A` is True; `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1, and `set_` must contain at least one more unique element (e.g., `set_` could be [1, 2]); `not_c` is False; `i` is 2**
