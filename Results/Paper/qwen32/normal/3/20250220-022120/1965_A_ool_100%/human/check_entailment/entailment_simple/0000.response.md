### Reasoning:
The problem can be analyzed using the concept of Grundy numbers (or Nimbers) from combinatorial game theory, which is particularly useful for impartial games like this one. However, in this specific game, a simpler approach can be used based on the properties of the piles of stones.

The key observation is that the game can be reduced to a game of Nim where the piles are represented by their stone counts. In this specific game, the strategy revolves around the unique counts of stones in the piles. Here's how the program logic works:

1. **Initial Check for `set_[0] != 1`**:
   - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by removing a number of stones equal to the size of the smallest pile, thereby making the smallest pile size 1. After that, Bob will be forced into a losing position if Alice plays optimally.

2. **Checking Differences Between Consecutive Elements**:
   - If the smallest pile size is 1, the program then checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1. This means the pile sizes are consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - If the pile sizes are consecutive integers starting from 1, the game can be seen as a Nim game where the Grundy number for the entire game is the XOR of all pile sizes. If the number of unique pile sizes is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - If there is any gap in the sequence of pile sizes, Alice can force a win by making the pile sizes consecutive starting from 1.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It first checks if the smallest pile size is not 1. If so, Alice wins.
- If the smallest pile size is 1, it checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1. If they are, the program toggles the value of `A` based on the parity of the number of unique pile sizes.
- Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program correctly determines the winner for each test case by adhering to the optimal strategies derived from the game's properties.
