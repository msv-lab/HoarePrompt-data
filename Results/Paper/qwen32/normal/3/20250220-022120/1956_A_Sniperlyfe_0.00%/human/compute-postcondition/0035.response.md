The code snippet provided resets the `res` list to an empty list. This means the previous contents of `res` (which were the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the original `qs`) are discarded, and `res` is now an empty list. All other variables (`qs`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `q`, `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`qs` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the last integer in the new `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is an empty list.**
