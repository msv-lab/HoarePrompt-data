Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, and `p` is a list of k integers (where k is the length of the sequence a) such that 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100, and each a_i represents the position of the player to be kicked out in each round; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = []
    for n in qs:
        res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the last integer in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers, `res` has the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended for each element in `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the last integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 1, `qs` is a list of integers, and `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `qs` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the last integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are integers in `qs`, where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
