The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, `p` is a list of k integers (where k is the length of the sequence a) such that 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100, and each a_i represents the position of the player to be kicked out in each round; `t` must be greater than 0**
