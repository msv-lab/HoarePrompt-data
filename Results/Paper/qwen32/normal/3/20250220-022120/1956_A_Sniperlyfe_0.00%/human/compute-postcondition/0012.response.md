The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has at least one more integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the next integer in `qs`, and `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one more integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must still have at least one more integer. The variable `n` will be the next integer in `qs`.

State: **`n` is the next integer in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one more integer, `res` has the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it**.

Since `n` is updated to the next integer in `qs` at the start of each iteration, we need to reflect that `n` is now the next integer in `qs` for the upcoming iteration.

State: **`n` is the next integer in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one more integer, `res` has the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it**.

To be more precise, let's denote the next integer in `qs` as `n_next`:

State: **`n` is `n_next`, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one more integer, `res` has the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it**.
