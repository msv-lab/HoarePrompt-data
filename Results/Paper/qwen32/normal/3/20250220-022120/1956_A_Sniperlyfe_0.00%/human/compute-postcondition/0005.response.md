The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `res`. None of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `k`, `q`, `t`, `qs`) are modified by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers, `res` is an empty list.**
