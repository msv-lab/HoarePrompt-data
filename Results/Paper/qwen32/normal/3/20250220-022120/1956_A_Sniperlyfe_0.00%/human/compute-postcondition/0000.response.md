`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `p` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, and `p` is a list of k integers (where k is the length of the sequence a) such that 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100, and each a_i represents the position of the player to be kicked out in each round; `t` is an input integer.**
