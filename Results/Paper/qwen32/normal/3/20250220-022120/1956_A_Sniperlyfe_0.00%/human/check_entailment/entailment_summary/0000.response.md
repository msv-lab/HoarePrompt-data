### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to ensure correctness.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Initial Setup**: We have `n` players lined up.
2. **Rounds**: In each round, players at positions specified by the sequence `a` are kicked out. If a position does not exist, it is skipped.
3. **Termination**: The game ends when no players are kicked out in a round.
4. **Output**: For each value `n_i` in the list of queries, determine how many players remain after the game ends.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Given `n` players and a list `p` of positions to kick out, this function determines how many players remain after all rounds.
- **Logic**:
  - While there are enough players (`n >= min(p)`), reduce `n` by the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.
  - The function returns the final count of players remaining.
- **Execution Summary**: This function correctly models the game's rounds by iteratively reducing the number of players based on the positions to be kicked out.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function reads multiple test cases, processes each one, and prints the results.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of queries `qs`.
  - For each query `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1` to determine the number of remaining players and appends the result to `res`.
  - It prints the results for each test case.
- **Execution Summary**: This function correctly handles the input/output for multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to compute the results.

### Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: The function correctly implements the logic to simulate the game rounds and determine the number of players remaining. It iteratively reduces the count of players based on the positions to be kicked out, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to compute the results for each query. It handles the input/output as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work together correctly to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
