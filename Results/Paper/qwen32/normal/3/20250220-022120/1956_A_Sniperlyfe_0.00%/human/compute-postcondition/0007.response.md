Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `res` has an additional element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**

This means that the list `res` now includes one more element, which is the output of the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `n` and `p`. All other variables retain their initial values.
