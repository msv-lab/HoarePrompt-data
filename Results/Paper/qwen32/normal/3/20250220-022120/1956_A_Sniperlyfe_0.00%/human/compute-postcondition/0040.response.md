Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is the second integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`**

In simple terms, the list `res` now contains two elements, both of which are the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
