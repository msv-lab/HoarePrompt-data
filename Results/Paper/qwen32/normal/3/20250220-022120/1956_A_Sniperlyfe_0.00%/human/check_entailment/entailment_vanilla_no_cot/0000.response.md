Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in each game scenario as per the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly simulate the process of kicking out players based on the positions given by the sequence `a`. The function should simulate each round of the game by removing players at the specified positions and then checking if any players are left to be removed in the next round. The current implementation incorrectly calculates the number of remaining players by subtracting the count of positions that are less than or equal to the current number of players, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules.

The `func_2` function also has issues in that it prints the results after processing each `n` in `qs`, which means it will print intermediate results instead of printing all results for a test case at once as required by the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(n, positions):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        kicked_out = set()
        for pos in positions:
            if pos - 1 < len(players):
                kicked_out.add(players[pos - 1])
        if not kicked_out:
            break
        players = [player for player in players if player not in kicked_out]
    return len(players)

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        results = [simulate_game(n, positions) for n in qs]
        print(' '.join(map(str, results)))

# Call the main function to run the program
main()
```

In this corrected version, `simulate_game` correctly simulates the game by removing players at the specified positions and continues until no more players can be kicked out. The `main` function collects the results for all `n` values in `qs` before printing them, ensuring the output format matches the problem's requirements.
