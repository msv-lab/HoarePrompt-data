Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of players `n`, a list of positions `p` of players to be kicked out in each round, and a list of queries `qs`. For each query in `qs`, it calculates and prints the position of the last player remaining after the specified rounds of kicking out players as defined by `p`.**
