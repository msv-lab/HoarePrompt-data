To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to understand the values and transformations of the variables involved.

### Breakdown of the Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `p` is a list of integers.
- `k` is the first integer read from the input.
- `q` is the second integer read from the input.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
- `res` has an additional element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

### Key Points:
- The `res` list has an additional element, which is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
- The `print` statement converts each element of the `res` list to a string and joins them with a space before printing.

### Output Analysis:
- The `map(str, res)` function will convert each element of the `res` list to a string.
- The `' '.join(...)` function will concatenate these string representations of the elements in `res` with a space in between.

Since the exact values of `n`, `p`, `k`, `q`, `t`, `qs`, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`. However, we know that `res` contains at least one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Final Output:
The output will be a space-separated string of the elements in the `res` list, where each element is the string representation of the original element in `res`.

Output: **[space-separated string of elements in res where each element is the result of converting an element in res to a string] (where res contains at least the result of func_1(n, p))**
