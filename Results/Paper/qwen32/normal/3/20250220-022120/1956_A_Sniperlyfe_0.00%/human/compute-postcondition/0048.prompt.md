You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, and p is a list of k integers (where k is the length of the sequence a) such that 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100, and each a_i represents the position of the player to be kicked out in each round.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: `n` is the last integer in the list `qs` from the last iteration, `p` is the list of integers read from the input during the last iteration, `k` and `q` are the two integers read from the input during the last iteration, `t` is the total number of iterations, `qs` is the list of integers read from the input during the last iteration, and `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, and `p`, a list of integers where each integer represents the position of the player to be kicked out in each round. The function returns the position of the last player remaining in the game after all specified rounds of kicking players out.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
