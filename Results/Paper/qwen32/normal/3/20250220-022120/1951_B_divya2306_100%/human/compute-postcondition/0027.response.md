To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`.

Given:
- `win_with_swap` is `wins + 2`
- `wins` is less than `k - 2`
- The loop runs for `i` in the range from `win_with_swap` to `k - 1`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken a value that is less than `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `k - 1`.

Let's break it down:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `x` such that `win_with_swap <= x < k - 1`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.
- The condition `x + 1 < k - 1` must hold true for the loop to continue.

Since `win_with_swap` and `k` are constants for the loop, they do not need to be adjusted. Only `i` needs to be incremented.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct, `wins` is less than k - 2, `win_with_swap` is wins + 2, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Given that `i` was `win_with_swap` in the previous iteration, it should be `win_with_swap + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct, `wins` is less than k - 2, `win_with_swap` is wins + 2, `i` is `win_with_swap + 1`**.
