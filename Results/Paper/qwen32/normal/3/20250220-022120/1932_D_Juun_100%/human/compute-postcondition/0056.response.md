Postcondition: **`trumps` contains all trump card ranks except the last one that was just popped, `answers` contains all sorted non-trump card pairs plus the new string `'{rank}{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`, and if `trumps` is not empty, it also contains the newly appended string `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`. `suits` contains at least one suit with a non-None rank, `suit` is the next suit in the dictionary, and `rank` is the rank corresponding to the next suit in the dictionary. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns None.**
