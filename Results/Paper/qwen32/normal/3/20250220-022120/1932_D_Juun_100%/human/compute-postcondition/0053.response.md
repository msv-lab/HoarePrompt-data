The code appends a new string to the `answers` list and removes the last element from the `trumps` list. Here's the impact on the variables:

- `answers` gains a new element: `f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`
- `trumps` loses its last element.

The other variables (`suits`, `suit`, `rank`, `popped_trump`, `trump`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`trumps` contains all trump card ranks except the last one that was just popped, `answers` contains all sorted non-trump card pairs plus the new string `'{rank}{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` and the newly appended string `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`, `suits` contains at least one suit with a non-None rank, `suit` is the next suit in the dictionary, `rank` is the rank corresponding to the next suit in the dictionary, `popped_trump` is the last trump card rank that was just popped, and `trump` is the suit of the popped trump card.**
