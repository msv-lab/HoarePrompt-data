The only variable in the loop head is `trumps`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `trumps`. If `trumps` is not an empty list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `trumps` must contain at least one element, which means it should not be empty for the loop to execute one more time.

No other states need to be adjusted since the condition only involves `trumps`.

State: **`trumps` must contain at least one element, `answers` contains all formed pairs, `suits` contains `None` for all suits that had non-None ranks**
