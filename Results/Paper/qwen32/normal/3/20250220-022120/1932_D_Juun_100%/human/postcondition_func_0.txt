The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a number of rounds, a trump suit, and a discard pile of cards. It pairs non-trump cards of the same suit and pairs any remaining unpaired non-trump cards with the highest remaining trump cards. If there are insufficient trump cards to pair all unpaired non-trump cards, it outputs "IMPOSSIBLE". Otherwise, it prints all card pairs, first the non-trump pairs and then the pairs involving trump cards, in a specified order.
