The only variable in the loop head is `answer` from the `answers` list. To proceed with the next iteration of the loop, the `answer` variable should be updated to the next element in the `answers` list.

Given that `answers` must contain at least one pair at the start, and we are at the end of the previous iteration, it implies that the current `answer` was the last one processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there should be at least one more pair in `answers` that hasn't been processed yet.

State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` must contain at least two pairs, `suits` contains `None` for all suits that had non-None ranks**
