Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `trumps` must contain at least one element.
- `answers` contains all formed pairs.
- `suits` contains `None` for all suits that had non-None ranks.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`trumps.pop()`**: This operation removes and returns the last element from the `trumps` list. Since `trumps` must contain at least one element, the first `trumps.pop()` will return the last element of `trumps`.
2. **`{trump}`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state. Since it is referenced in the print statement, we need to assume that `trump` is defined somewhere in the code before this print statement. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `trump` is a variable with some known value, say `trump = '♠'`.
3. **Second `trumps.pop()`**: After the first `trumps.pop()`, the `trumps` list will have one less element. The second `trumps.pop()` will then remove and return the new last element of the `trumps` list.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `trumps` initially contains `['7', '8', '9']` and `trump = '♠'`.

- First `trumps.pop()` will return `'9'`, and `trumps` will be `['7', '8']`.
- The first part of the print statement will be `'9♠'`.
- Second `trumps.pop()` will return `'8'`, and `trumps` will be `['7']`.
- The second part of the print statement will be `'8♠'`.

### Final Output:
The final print statement will be `'9♠ 8♠'`.

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the assumptions made, the output will be the concatenation of the last two elements of the `trumps` list, each followed by the value of the `trump` variable.

### Output:
Output: **[last_element_of_trumps]trump [second_last_element_of_trumps]trump (where trump is the value of the trump variable)**

If we assume `trump = '♠'` and `trumps` initially contains `['7', '8', '9']`, the output will be:
Output: **9♠ 8♠**
