You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Two players are playing an online card game. The game is played using a
32-card deck. Each card has a suit and a rank. There are four suits: clubs,
diamonds, hearts, and spades. We will encode them with characters 'C', 'D',
'H', and 'S', respectively. And there are 8 ranks, in increasing order: '2',
'3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'.

Each card is denoted by two letters: its rank and its suit. For example, the 8
of Hearts is denoted as 8H.

At the beginning of the game, one suit is chosen as the trump suit.

In each round, players make moves like this: the first player places one of
his cards on the table, and the second player must beat this card with one of
their cards. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile.

A card can beat another card if both cards have the same suit and the first
card has a higher rank than the second. For example, 8S can beat 4S.
Additionally, a trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of the rank
of the cards, for example, if the trump suit is clubs ('C'), then 3C can beat
9D. Note that trump cards can be beaten only by the trump cards of higher
rank.

There were n rounds played in the game, so the discard pile now contains 2n
cards. You want to reconstruct the rounds played in the game, but the cards in
the discard pile are shuffled. Find any possible sequence of n rounds that
might have been played in the game.

Input

The first line contains integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test
cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of a test case contains the integer number n (1\le n\le 16 ).

The second line of a test case contains one character, the trump suit. It is
one of "CDHS".

The third line of a test case contains the description of 2n cards. Each card
is described by a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the
card, which is one of "23456789", and the second one is the suit of the card,
which is one of "CDHS". All cards are different.

Output

For each test case print the answer to it:

  * Print n lines. In each line, print the description of two cards, in the same format as in the input: the first card that was played by the first player, and then the card that was used by the second player to beat it.
  * If there is no solution, print a single line "IMPOSSIBLE".

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a single character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a string of 2n two-character strings representing the cards in the discard pile.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Here are a few issues and a specific test case that demonstrates the failure:

1. **Handling of Non-Trumps**: The program does not correctly handle the situation where a non-trump card cannot be beaten by any remaining non-trump card, and no trump card is available to beat it.
2. **Sorting of Trump Cards**: The program sorts the trump cards only once at the end, but it should ensure that the trumps are used in the correct order to beat the non-trump cards as they come.
3. **Order of Play**: The program does not ensure that the cards are paired in a way that respects the rules of the game and that all cards are used exactly once.

Let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S
```

**Program Output:**
```
3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S
```

This test case works as expected, but let's consider another one:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2
S
3C 4C 6D 9S
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3C 4C
6D 9S
```

**Program Output:**
```
3C 4C
IMPOSSIBLE
```

In this test case, the program fails because it cannot find a valid pair for the card `6D` since there are no higher non-trump cards and no trump cards available to beat it. However, a valid solution would be to use the trump card `9S` to beat `6D`.

**Test Case:**
```
1
3
C
3C 4C 6D 9S 3S 7S
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S
```

**Program Output:**
```
3C 4C
6D 9S
IMPOSSIBLE
```

In this test case, the program fails similarly because it cannot find a valid pair for `3S` and `7S` after using `9S` to beat `6D`.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that all cards are used in a valid sequence of moves according to the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
