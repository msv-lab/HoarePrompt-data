The code snippet `suits[suit] = rank` assigns the value of `rank` to the key `suit` in the dictionary `suits`. The values of `t`, `n`, `trump`, `rank`, `suit`, and `card` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16), `trump` is a single character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `rank` is the first character of `next_card`, `suit` is the second character of `next_card`, `card` is `next_card`, `suits[suit]` is `rank`**.
