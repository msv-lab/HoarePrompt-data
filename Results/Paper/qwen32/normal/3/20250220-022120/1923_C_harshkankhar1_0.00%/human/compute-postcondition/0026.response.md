Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `c` of `n` integers. It then processes `q` queries, each consisting of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, it determines if the sum of the elements in `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) is at least as large as the count of elements in that range that are greater than 1, and prints 'YES' if true, otherwise 'NO'.**
