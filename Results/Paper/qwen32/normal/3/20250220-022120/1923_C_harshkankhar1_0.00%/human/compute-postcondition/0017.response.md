Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative sum of the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, a 'NO' is printed if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise 'YES' is printed.**

Natural Language: The output state remains the same as the initial state for all variables except that a value ('NO' or 'YES') is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`. If the condition is met, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed.
