Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative sum of the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES'
        )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative sum of the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, a 'NO' is printed if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative sum of the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, and a value ('YES' or 'NO') has been returned.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is `q - 1`, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative sum of the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, and 'NO' has been returned if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` else 'YES' has been returned.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
