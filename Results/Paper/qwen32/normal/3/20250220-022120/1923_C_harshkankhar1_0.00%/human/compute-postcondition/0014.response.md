Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9.
- `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative sum of the integers read from the input.
- `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*a)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. Let's break down the construction of the list `a`:

1. `a[0]` is explicitly defined as 0.
2. For `i` from 1 to `n`, `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `c` up to index `i-1`.

So, if `c` is a list of integers, `a` will look like this:
- `a[0] = 0`
- `a[1] = c[0]`
- `a[2] = c[0] + c[1]`
- `a[3] = c[0] + c[1] + c[2]`
- ...
- `a[n] = c[0] + c[1] + ... + c[n-1]`

### Output:
The code will print the elements of the list `a` starting from `a[0]` to `a[n]`.

Given that we do not have the exact values of `c`, we can only describe the structure of the output in terms of the cumulative sums of the elements in `c`.

Output: **0 c[0] c[0] + c[1] c[0] + c[1] + c[2] ... c[0] + c[1] + ... + c[n-1]** (where each term is the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `c` up to that index)
