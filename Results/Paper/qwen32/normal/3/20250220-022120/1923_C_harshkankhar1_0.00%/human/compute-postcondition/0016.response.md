The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This does not affect the initial state of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, and `b`). The values of `x` and `y` are now known and are set to the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative sum of the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, `x` is the first integer read from the input, `y` is the second integer read from the input.**
