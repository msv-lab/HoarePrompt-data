Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all of its iterations, the output state is as follows: The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The variable `n` is at least 1, and `q` is an integer between 1 and 300,000 inclusive. The list `c` contains `n` integers, each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1,000,000,000. The list `a` has `n + 1` elements where the first element `a[0]` is 0 and the subsequent elements `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input. The list `b` is updated such that each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of `b[i - 1]` plus `x`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
