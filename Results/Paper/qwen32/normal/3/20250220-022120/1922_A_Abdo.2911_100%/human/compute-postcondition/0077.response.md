Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `possible`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain as specified in the initial state. The only change is the execution flow, which breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
