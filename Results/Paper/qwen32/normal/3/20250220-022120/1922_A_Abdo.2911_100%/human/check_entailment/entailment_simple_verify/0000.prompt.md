You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The main issue lies in the way it checks whether a valid template exists.

Let's analyze the logic step by step:

1. The program iterates through each character position `i` in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are the same, it checks if the character at position `i` in `c` is different. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop.
3. If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are different, it checks if the character at position `i` in `c` is either the same as `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If not, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop.

The problem with this logic is that it does not ensure that a valid template `t` can be constructed for all positions `i` in the strings. Specifically:

- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be an uppercase letter that is different from `a[i]`. The program only checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, but it does not ensure that a valid `t[i]` exists.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be either `a[i]` (uppercase) or `b[i]` (uppercase). The program only checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, but it does not ensure that a valid `t[i]` exists.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each position `i`, there exists a valid `t[i]` that satisfies the conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] == a[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
            else:
                if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func_1()
```

This corrected version properly checks whether a valid template can be constructed for each position `i` in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. If a valid template can be constructed for all positions, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
