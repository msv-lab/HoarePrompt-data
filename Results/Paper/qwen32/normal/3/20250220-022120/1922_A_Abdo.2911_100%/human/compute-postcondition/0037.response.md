The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `possible` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 2; `possible` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
