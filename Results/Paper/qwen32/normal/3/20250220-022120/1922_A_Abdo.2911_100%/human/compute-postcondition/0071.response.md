Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is explicitly set to `True`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) retain their previous states or conditions.
