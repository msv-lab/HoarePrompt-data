Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `possible` has been explicitly set to `True`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial conditions.
