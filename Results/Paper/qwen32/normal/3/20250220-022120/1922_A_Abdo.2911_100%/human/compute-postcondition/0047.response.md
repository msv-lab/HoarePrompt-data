The code snippet assigns `n` the value of an integer input. The value of `possible` remains unchanged, and `t` has already been decremented by 1 before the code snippet is executed. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` and retains the conditions of `possible` and the decremented `t`.

Output State: **`possible` is a boolean, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer**.
