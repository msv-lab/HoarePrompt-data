Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `possible` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`, then `possible` is set to True if the character at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `a`. Otherwise, `possible` remains False. If the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `b`, then `possible` is set to True if the character at index `i` in `c` is neither equal to the character at index `i` in `a` nor the character at index `i` in `b`. Otherwise, `possible` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `possible` remains undetermined. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `possible` remains undetermined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True. Otherwise, `possible` remains undetermined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
