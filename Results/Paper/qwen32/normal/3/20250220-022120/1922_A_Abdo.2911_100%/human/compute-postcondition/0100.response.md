Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`, and the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the variables `possible`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their initial values and conditions. The only change is that the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
