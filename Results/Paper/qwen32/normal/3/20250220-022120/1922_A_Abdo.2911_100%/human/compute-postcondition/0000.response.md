`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as the code snippet only affects `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
