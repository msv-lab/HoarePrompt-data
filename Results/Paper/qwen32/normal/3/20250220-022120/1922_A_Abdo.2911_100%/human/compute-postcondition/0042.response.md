Given the initial state, we know that the variable `possible` is `True`. This means that during the loop, one of the conditions for setting `possible` to `True` was met, and the loop broke. The conditions for `possible` being `True` are:
1. Either `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]`, or
2. `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`.

Since `possible` is `True`, at least one of these conditions was satisfied for some index `i`.

The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, regardless of the value of `possible`. Therefore, the output is not dependent on the specific values of the lists `a`, `b`, or `c`, but only on the fact that the `possible` variable is `True`, which allowed the program to reach this point.

Output: **YES**
