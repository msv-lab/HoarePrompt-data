Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, `i` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
