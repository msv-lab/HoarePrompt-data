Output State: **`possible` is `False`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input value, `b` is the stripped input value, `c` is the stripped input value.**

In this output state, the variable `possible` has been explicitly set to `False`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) retain their initial values and states as described in the initial state.
