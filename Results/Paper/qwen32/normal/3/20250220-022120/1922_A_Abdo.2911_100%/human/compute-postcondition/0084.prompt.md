Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `possible` is `False`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input value, `b` is the stripped input value, `c` is the stripped input value.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `possible` is `True` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, or if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is `False`. `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `possible` retains its previous value. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` retains its previous value. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or if `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `a[i] != b[i]`, `possible` is set to True if `c[i] != a[i]`, and the loop is broken out of. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and the loop is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
