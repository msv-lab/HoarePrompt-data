The code snippet assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 1; `possible` is True**
