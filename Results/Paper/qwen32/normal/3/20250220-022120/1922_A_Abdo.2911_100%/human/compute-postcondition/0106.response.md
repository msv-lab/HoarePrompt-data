Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. Additionally, `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.**

In natural language: The variable `possible` has been set to `True`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
