Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `possible` is True; `i` is 0; the current character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the current character at index `i` in `b`; the current character at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the current character at index `i` in `a` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `possible`, and `i` remain unchanged. The loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement.
