The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 after the decrement, meaning it must have been at least 1 before the decrement.

State: **`possible` is a boolean indicating whether any iteration met the break conditions, `t` is at least 1, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged**.
