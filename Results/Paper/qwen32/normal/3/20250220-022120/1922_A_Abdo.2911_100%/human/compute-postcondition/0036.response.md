The code snippet assigns `True` to the variable `possible`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`. The conditions related to the values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` remain undetermined as they are not evaluated or changed by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 2; `possible` is True.**
