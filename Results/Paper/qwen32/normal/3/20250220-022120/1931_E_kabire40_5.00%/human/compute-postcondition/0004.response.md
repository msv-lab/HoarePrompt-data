The code snippet `operational_list = input().split()` reads an input string from the user, splits it by spaces, and assigns the resulting list to `operational_list`. The other variables (`t`, `y`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, and `max_power`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input by spaces.**
