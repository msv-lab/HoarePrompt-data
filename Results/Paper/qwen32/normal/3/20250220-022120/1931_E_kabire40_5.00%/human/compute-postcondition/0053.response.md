The code snippet updates the values of `list_len` and `max_power` by splitting the input string into two parts. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space.**

Natural language explanation: The values of `list_len` and `max_power` are updated to be the first and second parts of the input string split by space, respectively. The values of `t`, `y`, `rev_val`, and `rev_res` remain unchanged.
