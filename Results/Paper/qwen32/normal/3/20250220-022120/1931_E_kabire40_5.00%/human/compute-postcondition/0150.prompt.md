Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. The list a contains n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_val = []
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = input().split()
    for x in operational_list:
        x_rev = int(x[::-1])
        if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
            rev_res = rev_res + x
        else:
            rev_val.append(x[::-1])
    rev_val.sort()
    for x in range(len(rev_val)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            val_in = int(rev_val[x])
            rev_res += str(val_in)
        else:
            val_in = rev_val[x]
            rev_res += val_in[::-1]
    if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has a different length than the original, `rev_res` is a concatenation of original strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has the same length as the original, plus `str(val_in)` if `x` is even, or the reverse of the current `val_in` if `x` is odd for all `x` in the range of the length of `rev_val`, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, and `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space. If `10

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rev_res` is the concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original string, followed by the processed elements of `rev_val`. If `rev_res` is greater than `10` raised to the power of `max_power`, then `rev_res` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, `rev_res` does not exceed `10` raised to the power of `max_power`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rev_res` is a concatenation of all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` equals the length of `x[::-1]`, followed by the string representation of `int(rev_val[x])` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is odd, for all `x` in the range of `len(rev_val)`. `y` is `y_initial + n`. `rev_val` is a sorted list of `x[::-1]` for all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` does not equal the length of `x[::-1]`. `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` retain their initial values. If `10




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
