The code snippet `rev_res = rev_res + x` concatenates the current value of `rev_res` with the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `rev_res` is either an empty string or the string representation of `x_rev` if the lengths match, and `x` is `operational_list[1]`.

If `rev_res` was an empty string, after the operation, `rev_res` becomes the value of `x`. If `rev_res` was not an empty string, it remains the same string with `x` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input by spaces and must contain at least two elements, `x` is `operational_list[1]`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `operational_list[1]`, `rev_res` is either `operational_list[1]` if it was an empty string or `rev_res` + `operational_list[1]` if it was not empty, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `operational_list[1]` if `rev_res` is an empty string, otherwise `rev_val` is an empty list**.
