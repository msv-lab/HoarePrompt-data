Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has a different length than the original, `rev_res` is a concatenation of original strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has the same length as the original, plus `str(val_in)` if `x` is even, or the reverse of the current `val_in` if `x` is odd for all `x` in the range of the length of `rev_val`, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, and `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space. Additionally, `10 ** int(max_power)` is greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)`**
