Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has a different length than the original, `rev_res` is a concatenation of original strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has the same length as the original, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has a different length than the original and must have at least one element, `rev_res` is a concatenation of original strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has the same length as the original, plus `str(val_in)` if `x` is even, or the original form of `val_in` if `x` is odd, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, and `x` is an integer. If `x` is even, `val_in` is an integer equal to `int(rev_val[x])`. If `x` is odd, `val_in` is the string at index `x` in `rev_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has a different length than the original and must have at least one element, `rev_res` is a concatenation of original strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has the same length as the original, plus `str(val_in)` if `x` is even, or the original form of `val_in` if `x` is odd, plus the reverse of the current `val_in` if `x` is odd, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, and `x` is incremented by 1. If `x` is even, `val_in` is an integer equal to `int(rev_val[x])`. If `x` is odd, `val_in` is `rev_val[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has a different length than the original and must have at least one element, `rev_res` is a concatenation of original strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has the same length as the original, plus `str(val_in)` if `x` is even, or the original form of `val_in` if `x` is odd, plus the reverse of the current `val_in` if `x` is odd, plus `str(val_in)` if `x` is even, or the reverse of the current `val_in` if `x` is odd, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `x` is `x + 1`, and `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is even, or the original form of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is odd.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
