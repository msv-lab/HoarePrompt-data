Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input provided by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers input by the user such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\); `i` is 2. If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` holds true or neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds true.**
