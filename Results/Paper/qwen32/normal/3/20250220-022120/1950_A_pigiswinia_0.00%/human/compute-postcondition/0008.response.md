Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input provided by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers input by the user such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\). It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`. Additionally, it is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`. This means that either `a` is not less than `b`, or `b` is not greater than `c`, or both conditions are false.**
