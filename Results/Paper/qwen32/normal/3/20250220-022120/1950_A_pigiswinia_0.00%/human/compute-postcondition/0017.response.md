Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input provided by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers input by the user such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\). If `a < b > c`, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then `a < b < c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. `i` is 1.**
