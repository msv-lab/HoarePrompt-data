The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'PEAK'. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the value of the variables does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer input by the user, constrained by \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user, each constrained by \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\).
3. The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.

Since the `print` statement is `print('PEAK')`, it will output the string 'PEAK' regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`.

Output: **PEAK**
