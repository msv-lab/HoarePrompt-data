The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

The code snippet directly prints the string `'PEAK'` without referencing any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`. Therefore, the value of these variables does not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Based on the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer input provided by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\).
- There are conditions on the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement.
- `i` is set to 1.

Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'PEAK'`, the output will be:

Output: **PEAK**
