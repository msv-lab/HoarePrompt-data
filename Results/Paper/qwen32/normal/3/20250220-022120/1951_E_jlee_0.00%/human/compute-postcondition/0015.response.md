The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`) are modified.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`, and if `n` is 1, `done` remains False; `x` is the first character of `string` and is not equal to the last character of `string` (`s[-1]`).**
