Functionality: **The function processes a series of strings, each from a separate test case, and determines whether it is possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that the first part is not equal to the second part. For each string, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the split parts if such a split exists; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
