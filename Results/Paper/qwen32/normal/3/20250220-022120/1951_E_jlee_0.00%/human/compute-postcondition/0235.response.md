The provided Python code snippet contains a `print(2)` statement. This statement will output the integer `2` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `x`, `i`, `j`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` as described in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print(2)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.
2. The value `2` is explicitly provided in the `print` function, so it will be the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **2**
