To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and understand the context of the variables and the logic described.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: Greater than 0.
2. **`string`**: New user input.
3. **`s`**: A list of characters from the new `string`, with `n` being at least 1.
4. **`x`**: The first character of the new `string`.
5. **`i`**: A value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again.
6. **`count`**: Greater than 0 if the if condition was true.
7. **`done`**: Becomes `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`; otherwise, it remains `False`.
8. **`count2`**: Set to 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `x`; otherwise, it can be 0, greater than 0, and less than `count` if `count` is greater than 1.
9. **`j`**: Incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Output Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state and the variables described do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference any of the variables or conditions mentioned. The `print` statement is static and will always output `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `string`, `s`, `x`, `i`, `count`, `done`, `count2`, or `j`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
