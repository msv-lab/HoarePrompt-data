The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides several variables and their conditions but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `string`, `s`, `x`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, and the condition `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
