The `print(1)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, or `i`. The statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print(1)` statement.
2. The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **1**
