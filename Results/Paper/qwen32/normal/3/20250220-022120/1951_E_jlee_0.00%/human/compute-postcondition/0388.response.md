Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the new user input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `string`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged and the variables `i`, `j`, `count`, and `count2` retain their previous values.**
