Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `s[j]` is not equal to `x`; `done` is True; `i` is `i + 1`. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count` or `count2` is greater than `count`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is greater than 1, `count2` equals `count`. If `count` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `count2` is 0.**
