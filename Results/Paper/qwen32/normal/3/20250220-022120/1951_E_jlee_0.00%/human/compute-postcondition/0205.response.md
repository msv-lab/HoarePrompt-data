Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string` with `n` being at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is greater than 0; `count2` is equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is 0; `i` is the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again; `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` or `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False; `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.**
