Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and must be less than `(n + 1) // 2`; `done` is True; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, and `done` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
