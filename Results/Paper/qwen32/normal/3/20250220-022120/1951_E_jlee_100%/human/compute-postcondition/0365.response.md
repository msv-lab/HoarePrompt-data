Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 0; `count` is greater than 0; `count2` is 1; `done` remains False; `s[j]` is equal to `x`**

In this output state, the value of `count2` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
