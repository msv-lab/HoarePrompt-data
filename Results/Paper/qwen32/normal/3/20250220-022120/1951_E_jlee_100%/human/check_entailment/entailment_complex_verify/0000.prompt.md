You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines whether it is possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that the resulting parts are not palindromes and prints 'YES' along with the split positions if possible, otherwise prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to provide a valid partition for certain strings that can indeed be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
abacaba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
3
aba cab a
```

Explanation of the expected output: The string "abacaba" can be partitioned into "aba", "cab", and "a". However, "a" is a palindrome, so this partition is not valid. A valid partition could be "ab", "ac", "aba", but the program might not find this.

**Program Output:**
The program will likely output "NO" for this input, which is incorrect because a valid partition exists.

Another test case:

**Input:**
```
1
aaaabbbb
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
2
aaab bb
```

Explanation of the expected output: The string "aaaabbbb" can be partitioned into "aaab" and "bb", both of which are not palindromes.

**Program Output:**
The program will likely output "NO" for this input, which is incorrect because a valid partition exists.

The program appears to have logic that is too simplistic and does not consider all possible ways to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings. It does not handle cases where the string can be split into multiple non-palindromic substrings effectively.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
