The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides several variables (`t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`) and their values or conditions, but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
3. The variable `string` is the input string.
4. The variable `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. The variable `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
6. The variable `x` is the first element of `s`.
7. The variable `j` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not provided in the initial state.

Despite the presence of these variables, the `print` statement is straightforward and does not reference any of them. It simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **YES**
