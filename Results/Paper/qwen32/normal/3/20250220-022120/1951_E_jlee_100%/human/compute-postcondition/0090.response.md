Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is initialized to 0.
3. `string` is the input string.
4. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
6. `x` is the first element of `s`, i.e., `s[0]`.
7. `j` is initialized to 0 and then incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
8. The code then checks if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If true, `done` is set to True.
9. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.
- There are no conditions or variables that affect the execution of this print statement. It will always execute and print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `done`, or `count`.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state, the output will always be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
