The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no other changes to the variables due to this statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `n`; `count` and `count2` are set based on the loop conditions; `done` is False; and the condition `not done` is true. If `n` equals 1, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
