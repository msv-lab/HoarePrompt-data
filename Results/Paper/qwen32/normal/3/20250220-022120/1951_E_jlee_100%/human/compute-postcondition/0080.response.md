To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `j` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 0.
- `string` is the input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is `s[0]`.
- The conditions for `done` and `count2` are based on the value of `s[j]` and other variables, but these do not affect the loop head directly.

The loop head is:
```python
for j in range(n):
```
This means that `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

**Step-by-Step Adjustment:**
1. **Adjust `j`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value (let's call it `j_end`). At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_end + 1`.
2. **Adjust `n`:** The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `s` and does not change during the loop.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
- `t` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- `string` remains the same.
- `s` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `x` remains the same.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `j_end + 1`**.

Since we do not have the specific value of `j_end`, we can generalize it as `j` being incremented by 1 from its previous value. If we assume `j_end` was `j` at the end of the last iteration, then the new `j` will be `j + 1`.

So, the final state can be written as:
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `j + 1`**.
