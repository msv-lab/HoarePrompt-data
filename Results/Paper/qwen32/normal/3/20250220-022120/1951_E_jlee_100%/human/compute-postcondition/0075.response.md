Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`. `count` is greater than 0, indicating that there is at least one character in `s` that is different from `x` and `count` has been set to the index of that character. `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count2` equals `count`, `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1 or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` within the loop. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
