Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 3; `count2` is greater than or equal to 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 3. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `count2` is less than `count`, or if `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, or if `count2` does not equal `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is incremented by 1.**
