The `print(string)` statement will output the value of the variable `string`. According to the initial state, `string` is described as "the newly input string." This means that `string` holds the value of whatever string was input into the program.

No specific value for `string` is provided in the initial state, so we can only describe the output in terms of this input string.

Output: **string (where string is the newly input string)**
