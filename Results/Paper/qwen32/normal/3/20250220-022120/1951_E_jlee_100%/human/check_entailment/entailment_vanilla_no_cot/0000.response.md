Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, but it should handle this case more succinctly and directly.

2. **Strings with All Identical Characters**: The program correctly identifies that a string with all identical characters cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings unless the length is 2 or more, but it could be simplified.

3. **General Case Handling**: The program's logic for handling general cases is overly complex and includes some incorrect assumptions. For example, it tries to find a non-palindromic partition by checking specific conditions, but it does not guarantee that it will find a valid partition when one exists.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. For example, it might incorrectly identify a string as non-partitionable when it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

A simpler and more correct approach would be to:
- If the string length is 1, print "NO".
- If the string length is 2 or more, it can always be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings by splitting it into substrings of length 2 or more, ensuring no substring is a palindrome.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            # Split the string into two parts, ensuring neither is a palindrome
            if n == 2:
                print(2)
                print(string[0], string[1])
            else:
                print(2)
                print(string[0], string[1:])

func()
```

This simplified approach ensures that for any string of length 2 or more, we can always find a valid partition into non-palindromic substrings.
