Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`. `count` is greater than 1, indicating that there are at least two characters in `s` that are different from `x` and `count` has been set to the index of one of those characters. `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. The state of `done` is True. Additionally, `count2` is greater than or equal to `count` and currently, `count2` equals `count`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
