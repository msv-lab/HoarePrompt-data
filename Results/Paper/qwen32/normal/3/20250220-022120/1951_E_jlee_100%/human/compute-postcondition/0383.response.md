Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 2.
- `string` is the newly input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is `s[0]`.
- `j` is 3.
- `count2` is greater than or equal to 0.
- There is a conditional logic involving `s[j]`, `x`, `count`, `s[n - 1 - j]`, and `done`, but the exact state of these variables before the `print` statement is not relevant to the output of the `print` statement itself.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'YES'`. The value `'YES'` is explicitly given and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'YES'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **YES**
