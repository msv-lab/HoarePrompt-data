The given `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions affect the output of this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, or any other variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
