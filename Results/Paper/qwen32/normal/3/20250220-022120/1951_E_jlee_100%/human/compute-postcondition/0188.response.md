Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True, otherwise `done` remains False; `count` is `j`; `count2` is 0. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change any of the variables or the state of the program. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
