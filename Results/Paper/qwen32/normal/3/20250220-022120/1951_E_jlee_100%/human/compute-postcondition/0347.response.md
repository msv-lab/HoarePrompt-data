To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `string` is a newly input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is set to `s[0]` (the first character of the string `s`).
- `j` is initialized to 0.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- `count2` is initialized to 0.
- `done` remains False.
- The current character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is set to `count`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Index `j`**: The variable `j` is initialized to 0. Therefore, `j - 1` is `-1`.
2. **String Slicing**:
   - `string[:j - 1]` translates to `string[:-1]`. This means it will take the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the last character.
   - `string[j - 1:]` translates to `string[-1:]`. This means it will take the substring from the last character to the end of `string`.

Given that `j` is 0, `j - 1` is `-1`, and the slicing operations are based on this index:
- `string[:-1]` will give all characters of `string` except the last one.
- `string[-1:]` will give the last character of `string`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the substring of `string` excluding the last character, followed by the last character of `string`.

Output: **string[:-1], string[-1:] (where string[:-1] is all characters of string except the last one, and string[-1:] is the last character of string)**
