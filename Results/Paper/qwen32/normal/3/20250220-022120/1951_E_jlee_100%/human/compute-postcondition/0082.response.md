Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is initialized to 0.
3. `string` is an input string.
4. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
6. `x` is the first element of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`).
7. `j` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `j = j + 1`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(1)` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the integer `1`.
- None of the variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, or `j` are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the value of the print statement does not depend on the values of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

### Output:
Output: **1**
