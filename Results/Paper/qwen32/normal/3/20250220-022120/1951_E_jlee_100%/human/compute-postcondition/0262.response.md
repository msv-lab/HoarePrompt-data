The code snippet assigns `True` to the variable `done`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `j + 1`; `done` is True**.
