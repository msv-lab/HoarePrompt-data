Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`; `done` is False; `count` and `count2` are the values after the last iteration. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the program checks if `n` is odd and if the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`. Otherwise, the program maintains the same state as described. If `s.count(x) != n - 1`, the program maintains the same state as described.**
