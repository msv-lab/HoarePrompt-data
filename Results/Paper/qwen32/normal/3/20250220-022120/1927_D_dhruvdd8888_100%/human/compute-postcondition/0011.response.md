The code snippet `s = i` assigns the value of `i` to `s`. The value of `i` is not explicitly given in the initial state, but it is used in the list `arr` as `(1, i, nums[0])`. Since `i` is part of the tuple in `arr`, its value is known within the context of the list. However, since `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we will consider `i` as it is used in the list.

Given that `arr` is defined as `[(1, i, nums[0])]`, we can infer that `i` is some integer value, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, we will keep `i` as it is and update `s` to be equal to `i`.

The other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `e`, `num`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `s` is `i`; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is [(1, i, nums[0])]**.
