To determine the output of the print statement `print(s, e + 1)`, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the relationships between the variables.

### Analysis of the Initial State:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases or iterations.
2. **`N`**: An integer read from the input, which is the length of the initial list `nums` before appending -1.
3. **`nums`**: A list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it.
4. **`s`**: The starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`. This is updated based on the insertion point `eli` and the last index `LA`.
5. **`num`**: Set to -1, but its role is not directly relevant to the final print statement.
6. **`arr`**: Contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`. Each tuple is structured as `(value, start_index, end_index)`.
7. **`i`**: Set to `N + 1`, which is the initial length of `nums` before appending -1.
8. **`LA`**: Set to `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `arr`.
9. **`l` and `r`**: Two integers read from the input, representing some range.
10. **`eli`**: The index where `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
11. **`e`**: The ending index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`. This is also updated based on the insertion point `eli` and the last index `LA`.

### Conditions and Updates:
- **If `s > l`**:
  - If `s == 1` or `s > r`, the state remains as described.
  - Otherwise, `s` is not equal to 1 and `s` is not greater than `r`.
- **If `s <= l`**:
  - If `e >= r`, the conditions remain as described.
  - Otherwise, `e < r` and `e` is less than `N` or `e` is less than `l`.

### The Print Statement:
The print statement `print(s, e + 1)` outputs the values of `s` and `e + 1`.

### Deriving the Output:
- **`s`**: This variable is the starting index of a segment in `arr` at the position determined by `min(eli, LA)`.
- **`e`**: This variable is the ending index of the same segment in `arr` at the position determined by `min(eli, LA)`.
- **`e + 1`**: This is simply the ending index plus one, which can be interpreted as the position just after the segment ends.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement will output the starting index `s` of the segment and the position just after the segment ends (`e + 1`).

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the starting index of the segment at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and e + 1 is the position just after the segment ends)**
