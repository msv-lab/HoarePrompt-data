Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it, `s` is the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)` (updated), `num` is -1, `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`, `i` is N + 1, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input in this iteration, `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, and `e` is the ending index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)` (updated). The input value for the next iteration is decremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, regardless of whether `e < N` or `e < l` is true, the state of the program variables remains unchanged after the if-else block executes. Specifically, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `N` retains its value, `nums` keeps its list of integers with an appended -1, `s` is updated to be the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`, `num` remains -1, `arr` continues to hold tuples of contiguous segments of identical numbers in `nums`, `i` remains N + 1, `LA` is updated to be `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` retain their values as read from the input, `eli` is the insertion index for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `e` is updated to be the ending index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`, and the input value for the next iteration is decremented by 1.
