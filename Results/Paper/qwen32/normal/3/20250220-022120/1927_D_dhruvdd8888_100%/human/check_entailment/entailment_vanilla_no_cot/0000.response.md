Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. The main issue lies in the logic for finding the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `[l, r]`. The current approach uses a run-length encoding technique to group consecutive identical elements, but it fails to correctly identify valid pairs for each query.

Here are some specific issues:
1. The logic for handling the boundaries and finding valid pairs is flawed. For example, the program does not correctly handle cases where the range `[l, r]` contains only one unique element.
2. The use of `bisect_left` to find the correct segment in the run-length encoded array is not sufficient to determine the correct indices for each query.
3. The program does not correctly handle the edge cases where the range `[l, r]` contains exactly two different elements, and one of them appears only once.

To correctly solve the problem, a more straightforward approach would be to iterate through the range `[l, r]` for each query and find the first two different elements. Alternatively, a segment tree or another data structure could be used to efficiently query the range for different elements, but the given program does not implement this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program that directly checks for the first two different elements in the range `[l, r]`:

```python
import sys

def solve():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    tc = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    for _ in range(tc):
        N = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        nums = list(map(int, input[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        q = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, input[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            found = False
            for i in range(l - 1, r):
                for j in range(i + 1, r):
                    if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                        print(i + 1, j + 1)
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                print(-1, -1)

solve()
```

This corrected version directly checks for the first two different elements in the range `[l, r]` for each query, which is sufficient given the problem constraints.
