The code snippet uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the list `arr`. This insertion point is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not less than `(l, 0, 0)`.

Given the initial state, the variable `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`. The variable `eli` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.

The values of `t`, `N`, `nums`, `s`, `num`, `i`, `LA`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only change is the assignment of `eli`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it, `s` is the starting index of the last segment, `num` is -1, `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`, `i` is N + 1, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.**
