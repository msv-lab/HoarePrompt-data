To determine what will be printed by the `print(s - 1, s)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables `s` and `LA`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Breakdown:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this variable does not affect the current print statement).
   - `N` is an integer read from the input.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it.
   - `s` is the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `num` is -1.
   - `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `i` is N + 1.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input in this iteration.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `e` is the ending index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`.

2. **Understanding `s`:**
   - `s` is the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `LA` is the last index of `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`.

3. **Determine `min(eli, LA)`:**
   - `eli` is the insertion index for `(l, 0, 0)` to maintain sorted order in `arr`.
   - `LA` is the last index of `arr`.
   - `min(eli, LA)` will be `eli` if `eli` is less than or equal to `LA`; otherwise, it will be `LA`.

4. **Value of `s`:**
   - `s` is the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - Since `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of identical numbers in `nums`, `s` will be the starting index of the segment at the determined index in `arr`.

5. **Output Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(s - 1, s)`.
   - `s` is the starting index of a segment in `arr`.
   - `s - 1` will be the index immediately before `s`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the print statement `print(s - 1, s)` will output the index immediately before the starting index of the segment at `min(eli, LA)` and the starting index of that segment itself.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the starting index of the segment at index min(eli, LA) in the arr list)**
