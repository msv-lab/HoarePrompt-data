The provided code snippet is:

```python
input = sys.stdin.readline
```

This line of code does not change the values of any existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, `r`). Instead, it reassigns the name `input` to the function `sys.stdin.readline`. This means that any subsequent calls to `input()` in the code will actually call `sys.stdin.readline()`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The name `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.readline`.**
