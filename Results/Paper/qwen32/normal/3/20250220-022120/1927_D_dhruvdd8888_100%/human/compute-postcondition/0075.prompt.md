You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each query, l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `s` is the starting index of the last segment; `num` is -1; `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`; `i` is N + 1.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an integer read from the input, nums is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it, s is the starting index of the segment at index min(eli, LA) (updated for the last iteration), num is -1, arr contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in nums, i is N + 1, LA is len(arr) - 1. The loop has executed t times, and the input value for the next iteration would be 0. The variables l, r, eli, and e are the values from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 1,000,000. It also accepts an integer `q` representing the number of queries. For each query, it accepts two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each query, which is not specified in the provided details.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
