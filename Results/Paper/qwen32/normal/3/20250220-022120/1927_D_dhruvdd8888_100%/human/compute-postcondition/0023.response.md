The code snippet assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. This means `num` now holds the value of the element at index `i` in the list `nums`. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `i`, `arr`, and `s`) remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `i` is `i + 1`; `num` is `nums[i]`; If `nums[i] != num`, then `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it and `s` is equal to `i`.**
