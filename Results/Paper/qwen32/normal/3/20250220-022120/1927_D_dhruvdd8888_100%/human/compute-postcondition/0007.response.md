Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the list `nums` now includes an additional element `-1` at the end. All other variables remain unchanged.
