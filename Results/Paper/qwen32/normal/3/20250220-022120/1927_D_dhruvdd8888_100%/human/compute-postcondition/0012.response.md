Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `s` is set to `i`, `e` is set to 0, `num` is set to `nums[0]`, and `arr` is updated to [(1, i, nums[0])]; otherwise, `s`, `e`, `num`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**
