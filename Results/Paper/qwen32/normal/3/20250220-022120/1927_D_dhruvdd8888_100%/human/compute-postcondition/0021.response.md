The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to `s`. Therefore, `s` now holds the value of `i`. The values of `t`, `N`, `nums`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `i` is `i + 1`; `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it; `s` is equal to `i`.**
