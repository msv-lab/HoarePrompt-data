Output State: **The program returns a list that contains all divisors of `x` in ascending order. `output2` contains the divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output1` contains the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order. The concatenation of `output2` and `output1` results in all divisors of `x` sorted in ascending order.**
