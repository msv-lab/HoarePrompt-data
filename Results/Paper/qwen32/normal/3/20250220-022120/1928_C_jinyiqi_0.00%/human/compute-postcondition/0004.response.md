The code appends the value of `i` to the list `output1`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and `output2` remains an empty list. The precondition that `x` is divisible by `i` is still valid.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing the integer `i`; `output2` is an empty list; `x` is divisible by `i`.**
