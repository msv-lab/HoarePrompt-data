The code appends the result of `x / i` to the list `output2`. Given the initial state, `x` is divisible by `i`, so `x / i` will be an integer. The values of `x`, `n`, and `output1` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing the integer `i`; `output2` is a list containing the integer `x / i`; `x` is divisible by `i`.**
