The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters. According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given that `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, we need to adjust `i` to the next integer value.

Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`, and `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` (the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), we can express the state in terms of `i` being incremented by 1:

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.**
