The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input, assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`, and overwrites their previous values. The variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet, except that `i` was previously incremented by 1, which remains unchanged by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is greater than `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are the new integers provided by the input, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the new integers provided by the input, while `t` remains greater than `i`, and `i` retains its incremented value.
