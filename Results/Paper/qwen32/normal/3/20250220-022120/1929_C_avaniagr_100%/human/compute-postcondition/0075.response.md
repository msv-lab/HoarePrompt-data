Postcondition: **`s` is the next line from the input file, which is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers derived from splitting and converting `s`. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the condition `a >= x + 2` holds true. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 2`, the condition `a < x + 2` holds true. Otherwise, `z` is updated to the value after `x - k + 3` iterations of the loop, and `i` is `x - k + 2`. Additionally, `a` is either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`.**
