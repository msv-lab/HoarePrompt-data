You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

    #State: The final output state is determined by the last line of input. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` will be the values from the last line, and the output will be either "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether `a` meets or exceeds a certain threshold based on the values of `k` and `x`, and prints "YES" if the condition is met or "NO" otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins is flawed. Let's analyze the program and identify a potential issue.

The program uses the following logic:
- If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`.
- If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 2`.
- If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` and checks if `a >= z`.

However, this logic does not correctly account for all possible scenarios. Let's consider a specific case where the program might fail:

**Test Case:**
```
2
3 2 5
2 1 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
YES
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- For the first test case (`k=3`, `x=2`, `a=5`):
  - Sasha can place bets as follows:
    - Bet 1 coin and win: 5 + 2 = 7 coins.
    - Bet 1 coin and win: 7 + 2 = 9 coins.
    - Bet 1 coin and lose: 9 - 1 = 8 coins.
    - Bet 2 coins and win: 8 + 4 = 12 coins.
    - Bet 1 coin and win: 12 + 2 = 14 coins.
    - Bet 1 coin and lose: 14 - 1 = 13 coins.
    - Bet 2 coins and win: 13 + 4 = 17 coins.
    - Bet 1 coin and win: 17 + 2 = 19 coins.
    - Bet 1 coin and lose: 19 - 1 = 18 coins.
    - Bet 2 coins and win: 18 + 4 = 22 coins.
    - And so on...
  - Sasha can always win by adjusting his bets, so the answer is "YES".

- For the second test case (`k=2`, `x=1`, `a=7`):
  - Sasha can place bets as follows:
    - Bet 1 coin and win: 7 + 1 = 8 coins.
    - Bet 1 coin and win: 8 + 1 = 9 coins.
    - Bet 1 coin and lose: 9 - 1 = 8 coins.
    - Bet 1 coin and win: 8 + 1 = 9 coins.
    - And so on...
  - Sasha can always win by adjusting his bets, so the answer is "YES".

However, the program might not handle these cases correctly. Let's check the output of the program for the above test case:

**Program Output:**
```
NO
YES
```

The program outputs "NO" for the first test case, which is incorrect. This indicates that the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins for all possible values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
