The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`z`, `i`, `a`, `x`, and `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the values and relationships of several variables, but these variables are not used in the print statement.
2. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state.
3. The string `'YES'` is directly printed as specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
