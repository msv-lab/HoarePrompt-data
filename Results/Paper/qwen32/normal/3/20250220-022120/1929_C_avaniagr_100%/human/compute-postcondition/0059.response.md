The `print('YES')` statement will print the string 'YES' to the console. The initial state describes that `s` is a string containing three space-separated integers, and `k`, `x`, and `a` are derived from splitting and converting `s`. However, these variables (`k`, `x`, `a`) are not used in the provided print statement.

Thus, the output of the print statement is simply the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
