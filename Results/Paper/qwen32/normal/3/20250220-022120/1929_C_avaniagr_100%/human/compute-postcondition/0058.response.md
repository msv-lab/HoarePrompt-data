Postcondition: **`s` is the next line from the input file, which is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers derived from splitting and converting `s`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition is met; otherwise, the condition is not met. In both cases, `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their values derived from `s`.**
