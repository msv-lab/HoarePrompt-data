Output State: **`s` is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k` is the first integer from `s`, `x` is the second integer from `s`, `a` is the third integer from `s`. `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`. `z` is `k - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `z` is calculated as `k - 2`. The values of `s`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.
