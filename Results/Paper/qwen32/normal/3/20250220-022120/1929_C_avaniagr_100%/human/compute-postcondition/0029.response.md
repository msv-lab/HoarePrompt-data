Postcondition: **`s` is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k` is the first integer from `s`, `x` is the second integer from `s`, `a` is the third integer from `s`. If `x == k - 1`, then `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, it remains so; otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 2`. If `x != k - 1` and `x >= k`, then `z` is defined as `2x - k + 3`, and `a` is either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`.**
