Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`. If it's impossible to make the array not beautiful, we output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem with the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking its length. If the length of the set is `1`, it prints `-1` because the array is already uniform and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
4. If the array is not uniform, it tries to find the minimum length of contiguous segments of the same element. It does this by iterating through the array and counting the length of contiguous segments of the same element, updating the minimum length found.
5. Finally, it prints the minimum length of these contiguous segments as the answer.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Uniform Array**: The program correctly identifies if the array is uniform (all elements are the same) and returns `-1` in this case.
- **Non-Uniform Array**: The program attempts to find the minimum length of contiguous segments of the same element. However, this approach does not necessarily give the correct answer. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The minimum length of contiguous segments is `1`, but removing just one element (e.g., the middle `1`) does not make the array non-beautiful. The correct answer is `1` because removing the middle `1` results in `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for handling non-uniform arrays is flawed. It does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
