### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program's logic for handling non-uniform arrays is flawed. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Uniform Array Handling**:
   - The program correctly identifies if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking if the length of the set is `1`. If so, it outputs `-1` because a uniform array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - This part of the program is correct.

2. **Non-Uniform Array Handling**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum length of contiguous segments of the same element. It does this by iterating through the array and counting the length of contiguous segments of the same element, updating the minimum length found.
   - However, finding the minimum length of contiguous segments does not necessarily give the correct answer. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, which involves a more complex analysis of the array structure.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The minimum length of contiguous segments is `1`, but removing just one element (e.g., the middle `1`) does not make the array non-beautiful. The correct answer is `1` because removing the middle `1` results in `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.
   - Another example is the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The minimum length of contiguous segments is `3`, but removing three elements (e.g., the first three `3`s) results in `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful. The correct answer is `3`.
   - The program's approach does not account for such cases where the minimum number of elements to remove is not simply the length of the shortest contiguous segment.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program's logic for handling non-uniform arrays is flawed. The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
