The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` compares the current value of `ans` with `cnt` and assigns the smaller value to `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially set to `n` and `cnt` is 0. Since 0 is always less than or equal to `n` (as `n` is greater than or equal to 1), `ans` will be updated to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
