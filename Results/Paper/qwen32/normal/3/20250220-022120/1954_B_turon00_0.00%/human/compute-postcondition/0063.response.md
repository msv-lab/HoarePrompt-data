The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that the variable `a` will be updated to reflect the new list of integers provided in the input.

The initial state mentions that `a` is already a list of integers read from the input, but this line of code will overwrite `a` with a new list of integers from the input. Therefore, the value of `a` changes, but the other variables (`t`, `n`, `tmp`, `aa`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` if the list ends with `tmp`, otherwise 0, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found in the list `a`, or `n` if `tmp` is the only element in the list, updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.**
