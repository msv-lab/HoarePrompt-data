Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the input integer `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0 if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`. `i` is 4.**
