Functionality: **The function accepts parameters representing a tree structure with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000, and the tree has exactly two leaves. It also accepts an integer `u_1` representing the starting node of a stone, where `u_1` is between 1 and `n`. The function returns the number of steps required for the stone to move from the starting node to one of the leaves of the tree.**
