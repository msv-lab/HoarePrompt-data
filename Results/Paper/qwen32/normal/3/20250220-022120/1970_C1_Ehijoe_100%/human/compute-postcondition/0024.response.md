Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and must contain at least one key, `i` is `n-1`. If the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `ends` is a list containing `key`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list, `key` is the next key in `nodes` after `n-1` if it exists.**
