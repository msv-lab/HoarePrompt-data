The code snippet `ends.append(key)` adds the value of `key` to the `ends` list. Given the initial state, the only variable affected by this operation is `ends`, which will now contain `key` as an additional element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and must contain at least one key, `i` is `n-1`. If the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `ends` is a list containing `key`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list, `key` is the next key in `nodes` after `n-1` if it exists, `ends` is a list containing `key`.** 

In natural language, this means that `ends` now contains `key` as an element, and all other variables retain their initial values.
