The code snippet `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v` respectively. The initial state specifies that `u` and `v` are already defined as the first and second integers provided as input, but this line of code will overwrite these values with the new input.

The variables `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`, and `i` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where `nodes[u]` includes `v` and `nodes[v]` includes `u`, `u` is the first integer provided as new input, `v` is the second integer provided as new input, `i` is 1**.
