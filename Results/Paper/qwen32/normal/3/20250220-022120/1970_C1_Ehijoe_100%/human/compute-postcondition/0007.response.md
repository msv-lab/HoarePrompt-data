The code snippet `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list associated with the key `v` in the `nodes` dictionary. Given the initial state, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list, which means if `v` is not already a key in `nodes`, a new list will be created for it. After appending `u` to `nodes[v]`, the list associated with `v` will include `u` as one of its elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where `nodes[u]` includes `v` and `nodes[v]` includes `u`, `u` is the first integer provided as input, `v` is the second integer provided as input.**

In natural language: The value of `u` has been appended to the list associated with the key `v` in the `nodes` defaultdict. All other variables retain their initial values.
