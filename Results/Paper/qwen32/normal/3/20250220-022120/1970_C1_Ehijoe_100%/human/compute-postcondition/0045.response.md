Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is the integer provided as input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`; `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `nodes[s]` contains `s` and possibly another element; `i` is `n-1`; `ends` is a list containing all the leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the value of `s` twice and `curr`; `prev` is `nodes[s][1]`; `curr` is `nodes[curr][1]`**

Explanation: The value of `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
