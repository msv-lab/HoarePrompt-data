The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `t`. Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as an integer between 2 and 2 × 10^5, and `t` is initially 1. The input operation will update the value of `t` to whatever integer is provided in the input, but `n` will remain unchanged as the input operation does not affect it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input.**
