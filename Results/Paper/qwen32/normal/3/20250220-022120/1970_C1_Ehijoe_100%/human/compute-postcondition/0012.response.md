The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where `nodes[u]` includes `v` and `nodes[v]` includes `u`, `u` is the first integer provided as new input, `v` is the second integer provided as new input, `i` is 2, `nodes[v]` includes `u`**
