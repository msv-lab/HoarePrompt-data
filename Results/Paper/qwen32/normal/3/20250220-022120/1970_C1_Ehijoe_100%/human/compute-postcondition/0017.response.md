Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where each node `u` has a list of adjacent nodes `v` (representing an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges), `i` is `n-1`, `ends` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code only initializes an empty list called `ends`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.
