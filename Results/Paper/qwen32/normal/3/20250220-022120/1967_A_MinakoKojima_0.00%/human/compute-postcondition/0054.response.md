Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a` before the updates. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `a` is updated such that `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `ans` is the product of all differences `a[i] - a[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.**
