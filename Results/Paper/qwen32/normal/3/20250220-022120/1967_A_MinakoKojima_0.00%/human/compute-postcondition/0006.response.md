The code snippet assigns the factorial of `n` to the variable `ans`. Therefore, the value of `ans` changes to `math.factorial(n)`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`; `k` is greater than or equal to `n` multiplied by `m`.**
