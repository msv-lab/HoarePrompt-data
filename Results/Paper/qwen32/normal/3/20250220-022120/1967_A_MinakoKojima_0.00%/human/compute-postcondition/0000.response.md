To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The loop will execute if the value inside the `range` function is greater than 0.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop control variable:** The loop control variable here is `_`, which is a common convention in Python for a variable that we don't plan to use. It is generated by the `range` function.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution:** The loop will execute if the argument to the `range` function is greater than 0. The argument is `int(input())`, which means the loop will execute if the integer value read from the input is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state:** Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is greater than 0. This means that the number of test cases `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that the problem statement specifies `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, we know that `t` will always be greater than 0, and thus the loop will always execute as per the problem constraints. However, to adhere to the task requirements, we need to explicitly state that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be greater than 0**
