Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.**

Natural language: The value of `k` is decreased by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`. The values of `n` and the way `i` is incremented remain unchanged. The value of `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
