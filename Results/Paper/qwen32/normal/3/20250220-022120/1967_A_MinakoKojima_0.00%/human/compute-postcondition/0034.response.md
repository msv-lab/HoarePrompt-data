Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a` before the updates; `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that `ans` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(n)`. All other variables retain their initial state.
