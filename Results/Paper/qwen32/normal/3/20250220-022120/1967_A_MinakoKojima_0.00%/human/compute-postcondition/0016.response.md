Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is `a[i] - m`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a` before the update; `ans` is 0; `i` is 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `a[i]` has been updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new value of `a[i]` is calculated based on the minimum of `k` and `m + k // n - a[i]`, added to `m`.
