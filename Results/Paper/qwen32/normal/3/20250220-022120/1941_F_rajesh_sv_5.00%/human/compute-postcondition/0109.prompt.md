Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f`, `h` is the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f`, `mid` is equal to `l` (or `h`), `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` if `l == h`, `f` is the next value in `F`.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is updated to `mid + 1` or remains the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f`. `h` is updated to the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l` or remains equal to `mid`. `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated as `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively. `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` if `l == h`. `f` is the next value in `F`. Additionally, `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` if `l` was updated, otherwise `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` is updated to `mid + 1` or remains the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f` and `l < h`. `h` is updated to the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l` or remains equal to `mid`. `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`. `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` if `l == h`. `f` is the next value in `F`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is updated to the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l` or remains equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` or remains the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f` and `l < h`, and `h` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `l` is updated to `mid + 1` or remains the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f` and `l < h`. `h` is updated to the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l` or remains equal to `mid`. `mid` is now equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`. `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. Ensure `l < h` after updates. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `h` is set to the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l` or remains equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `l` is set to `mid + 1` or remains the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f` and `l < h`, and `h` is set to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
