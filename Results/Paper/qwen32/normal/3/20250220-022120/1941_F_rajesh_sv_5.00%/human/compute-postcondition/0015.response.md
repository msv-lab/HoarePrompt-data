The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 (since it was incremented from 2 in the previous iteration), and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4, and `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n` is at least 4, `m` and `k` are values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found so far, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found or None, `i` is 4**
