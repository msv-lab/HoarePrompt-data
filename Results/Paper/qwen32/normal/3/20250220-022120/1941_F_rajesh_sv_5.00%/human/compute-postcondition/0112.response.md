Postcondition: **`l` and `h` are equal, `mid` is equal to `l` (or `h`), `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated based on the final `mid`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` remains the last value used in the loop, and the condition `l == h` is true.**

Since there is no else part, the postcondition is solely based on the if part's postcondition.
