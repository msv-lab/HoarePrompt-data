You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem but has several issues and does not handle all edge cases correctly. Here are some specific points of concern:

1. **Function `func_1` and `wrapper`**:
   - These functions are defined but never used. They appear to be intended for memoization but are not applied to any function in the code.
   - The `d` dictionary in `func_1` and `wrapper` is local to `func_1` and will not be accessible or retain values across different calls to `wrapper`.

2. **Function `func_6`**:
   - This function processes each test case. It calculates `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` based on the differences between consecutive elements in `A`.
   - It then iterates over each function complexity `f` and tries to find a suitable model complexity `d` to minimize the imbalance.
   - The logic for adjusting `l` and `h` in the binary search loop is incorrect. The condition `if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` does not correctly determine the position to minimize the imbalance.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the new problem added could be the smallest or largest element in the final sorted list.
   - It assumes that adding a new problem will always be between two existing problems, which is not necessarily true.

4. **Output**:
   - The code prints the result for each test case, which is correct, but the logic to determine the minimum imbalance is flawed.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a simple test case:
```
1
3 1 1
1 10 20
5
5
```
- Here, the initial imbalances are `10 - 1 = 9` and `20 - 10 = 10`.
- The only possible new problem complexity is `5 + 5 = 10`.
- Adding this problem would result in the list `[1, 10, 10, 20]` with imbalances `10 - 1 = 9`, `10 - 10 = 0`, and `20 - 10 = 10`.
- The minimum imbalance should be `0`, but the code does not correctly identify this.

Given these issues, the code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
