Output State: **`A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n` is at least 4, `m` and `k` are values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found so far, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found or None, `i` is 4, `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`.**

In this output state, `max_diff` has been updated to the value of `diff`, which is `A[4] - A[3]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
