The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The values of `h`, `mid`, `D`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. The precondition that `l < h - 1` must still be checked with the new value of `l`.

Output State: **`l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is unchanged, `mid` is unchanged, `D` must have at least two elements with `left - f` less than some element in `D` and `right - f` greater than some element in `D`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
