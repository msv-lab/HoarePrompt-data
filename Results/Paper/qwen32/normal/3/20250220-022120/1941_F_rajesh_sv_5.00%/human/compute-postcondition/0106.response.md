Output State: **`l` is updated to `mid + 1`; `h` is updated to the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l` or remains equal to `mid`; `mid` is now equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. Ensure `l < h` after updates.**

In simpler terms, `l` has been incremented to `mid + 1`. The other variables `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated based on the new value of `l`, while maintaining the condition that `l < h`.
