Output State: **`A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`.**

In this output state, the variables `left` and `right` have been assigned the values of `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]` respectively, while all other variables retain their initial values.
