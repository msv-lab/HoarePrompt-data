The code snippet reassigns the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` using the same expressions they were initially assigned. Therefore, the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged after the code execution.

Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` must be at least `l + 1`**.
