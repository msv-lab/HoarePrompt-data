Postcondition: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `l < h - 1`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, while `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`, and `l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged.**
