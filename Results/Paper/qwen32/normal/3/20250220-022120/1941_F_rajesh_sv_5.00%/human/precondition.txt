The function is defined incorrectly for the given problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the values of n, m, k, the list of complexities a, the list of model complexities d, and the list of function complexities f. The precondition for the corrected function would be: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}; d is a list of m integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^9; f is a list of k integers such that 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
