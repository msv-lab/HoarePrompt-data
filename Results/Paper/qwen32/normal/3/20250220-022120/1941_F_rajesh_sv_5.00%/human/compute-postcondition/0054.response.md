Postcondition: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` must be at least `l + 1`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and `h` after the if-else block is executed, considering the conditions specified in the if and else parts.
