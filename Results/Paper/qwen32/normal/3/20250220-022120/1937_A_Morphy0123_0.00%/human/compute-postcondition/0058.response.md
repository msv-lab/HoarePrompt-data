Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), which is the length of the array `a`. Initially, the array `a` is defined such that `a_i = i` for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The function performs a swap operation for each `i` from 2 to `n` in order, swapping the element at position `i` with the element at position `j` such that `a_j = 1` after all operations. The function returns the position `j` where the value `1` is located after all swap operations are completed.**
