The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the variable `n` with the value of an integer input by the user. This affects the value of `n` but does not change the conditions or values of other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, and `power`).

Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is not equal to 1, then `power` is set to 3 if `power` is not already equal to `n` (where `16 <= n < 32`); otherwise, `power` remains equal to `n`.**
