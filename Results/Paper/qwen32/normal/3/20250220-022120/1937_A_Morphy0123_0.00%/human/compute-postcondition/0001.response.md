The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it iterates over the range of `n_cases`. To ensure that the loop executes, `n_cases` must be at least 1. The initial state of `i` before the loop starts is not explicitly defined, but it will be set to 0 by the `range` function when the loop begins.

Given that `n` and `a` are related to the body of the loop (which is omitted), they do not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts. The state only needs to ensure that the loop can execute based on the loop head variables.

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
