Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4), for each test case, `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9) is the length of the array `a` where initially `a_i = i` for each 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        while power < log2(n):
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is equal to 1, then no additional changes are made to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is calculated as `ceil(log2(n))`. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains `n`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `ceil(log2(n)) - 1` and `power` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is not equal to 1, then `power` is set to 3 if `power` is not already equal to `n` (where `16 <= n < 32`); otherwise, `power` remains equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `power` is determined as follows: If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged. If `n` is not equal to 1, `power` is set to 3 if `power` is not already equal to `n` (where `16 <= n < 32`); otherwise, `power` remains equal to `n`. If `n` is not 1 and does not meet the condition for setting `power` to 3, then `power` is `ceil(log2(n))` if `power` equals `n`; otherwise, `power` is `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
