You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and determines the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. It then prints this power of 2. If `n` is a power of 2, it prints `n` itself.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the specified operations. Here is an analysis of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic for Finding the Position of 1:**
   - The problem requires us to perform the `swap(k)` operation for each `i` from 2 to `n`, where `swap(k)` swaps `a_d` and `a_k` and `d` is the largest divisor of `k` that is not `k` itself.
   - After all swaps, we need to find the index `j` such that `a_j = 1`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses the `log2` function to determine the power of 2 that is closest to `n`.
   - It then prints `2 ** power` if `power` equals `n`, otherwise it prints `2 ** (power - 1)`.
   - This logic does not correctly simulate the swapping process described in the problem.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - For `n = 4`:
     - Initially, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - After `swap(2)`, `a = [2, 1, 3, 4]`.
     - After `swap(3)`, `a = [3, 1, 2, 4]`.
     - After `swap(4)`, `a = [3, 4, 2, 1]`.
     - The position of `1` is `4`.
   - The program would incorrectly output `2` for `n = 4` because `log2(4) = 2` and `2 ** 2 = 4` but the logic to determine the power is incorrect.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where `n` is a power of 2 correctly.
   - The logic to determine the power of 2 is flawed and does not account for the actual swapping process.

Thus, the program does not correctly find the position of `1` in the resulting array for all possible values of `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
