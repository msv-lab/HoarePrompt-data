To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `power` is defined as `ceil(log2(n))`.
   - The current value of `power` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `power` is defined as `ceil(log2(n))`, which means it is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`.
   - However, the problem explicitly states that the current value of `power` is equal to `n`. This seems to be a contradiction based on the typical definition of `power`. We will proceed with the given precondition that `power` is equal to `n`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - Given that `power` is equal to `n`, the expression `2 ** power` becomes `2 ** n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will print `2` raised to the power of `n`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is `2 ** n`.

Output: **2 ** n**
