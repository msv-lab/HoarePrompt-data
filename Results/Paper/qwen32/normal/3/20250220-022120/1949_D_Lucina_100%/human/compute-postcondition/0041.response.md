The code snippet `b[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the list `b` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, the value at index 1 in the list `b` will be incremented. The other variables, `n`, `x`, and the element at index `i` in the list `b` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `j` is 1, the element at index `j - 1` in the list `x` is 'S', the element at index `i` in the list `b` is incremented by 1, and the element at index `j` in the list `b` is incremented by 1.**
