The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is a string containing the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
