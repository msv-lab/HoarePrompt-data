The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` of the list `a` by 1. The variables `n` and `j` are not affected by this operation. The value of `a[i]` is increased by 1, but without knowing the initial value of `a[i]` or the value of `i`, we can only state that `a[i]` is now 1 greater than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `j` is 3, and `a[i]` is increased by 1.**
