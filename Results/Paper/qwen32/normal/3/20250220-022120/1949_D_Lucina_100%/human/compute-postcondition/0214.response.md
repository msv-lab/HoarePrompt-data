The given Python code snippet is:

```python
nx = ''
```

This line of code assigns an empty string to the variable `nx`. None of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`) are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, plus any additional indices `i` where both `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is still less than the length of `sb`, `n` is greater than 0, `nx` is an empty string.**
