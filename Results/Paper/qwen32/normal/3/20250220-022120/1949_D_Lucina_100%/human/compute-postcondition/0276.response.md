Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` has `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` is set to 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sb` up to the index `n // 4 - 1`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.**
