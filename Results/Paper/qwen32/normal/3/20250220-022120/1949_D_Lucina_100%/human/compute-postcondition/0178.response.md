The code snippet appends the character at position `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` was an empty string, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'. After the execution, `nx` will hold the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**.
