Let's carefully analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two arrays `a` and `b` to count the number of funny (`F`) and scary (`S`) transitions for each scenario.
   - It also reads the input lines into the list `xx`.

2. **Counting Transitions:**
   - For each input line (which represents the transitions from a scenario to all other scenarios), it updates the counts in `a` and `b` based on whether the transition is funny or scary.

3. **Classification of Scenarios:**
   - It classifies scenarios into two lists, `sa` and `sb`, based on whether they have only funny transitions (`sa`) or only scary transitions (`sb`).

4. **Choosing the Dominant Type:**
   - It compares the lengths of `sa` and `sb` to decide which type (funny or scary) to prioritize for the undecided transitions (`?`).

5. **Assigning Values to Undecided Transitions:**
   - If `sa` is longer or equal in length to `sb`, it assigns `F` to undecided transitions involving scenarios in `sa` up to a certain limit (`n // 4 - 1`), and `S` otherwise.
   - If `sb` is longer, it does the opposite, assigning `S` to undecided transitions involving scenarios in `sb` up to a certain limit (`n // 4 - 1`), and `F` otherwise.
   - The limit `n // 4 - 1` seems to be an attempt to balance the number of consecutive funny or scary transitions, but it does not directly address the requirement of not having more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive transitions of the same type.

6. **Output:**
   - It prints the modified transition matrix, replacing `?` with the chosen type of transition.

### Analysis of the Program's Logic:

- **Balancing Transitions:**
  - The program attempts to balance the number of consecutive funny and scary transitions by using the counts of `F` and `S` for each scenario.
  - However, the logic for assigning `F` or `S` to undecided transitions does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will not have more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive transitions of the same type for every possible scenario permutation.

- **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
  - The program uses the `n // 4 - 1` limit to assign `F` or `S` to undecided transitions, but this does not align with the problem's requirement to ensure that no sequence of transitions has more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive videos of the same type.

### Conclusion:

The program's approach to assigning values to undecided transitions does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will meet the problem's requirement. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all valid inputs.

**Correctness: False**
