The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. This means that the value of `nx` will now be its previous value concatenated with 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `nx`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 3, `i` is 1, `nx` is its previous value concatenated with 'S'.**
