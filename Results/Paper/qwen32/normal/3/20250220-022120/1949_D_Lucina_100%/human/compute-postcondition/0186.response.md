The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1 from its previous value, so we need to adjust `j` to be the next value for the next iteration.

Given that `j` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, it means that at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1` from the previous state.

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, and 'S' otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, we adjust `j`:
State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

To be more precise, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.
State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, since we do not have the specific value of `j` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:
State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For clarity, if we assume `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1`**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `k`, the most accurate general form is:
State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Therefore, the final adjusted state is:
State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
