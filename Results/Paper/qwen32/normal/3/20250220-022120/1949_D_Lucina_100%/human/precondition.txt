n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. Each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', where '.' occurs only on the diagonal (i.e., the i-th character of the i-th line), 'F' indicates a funny transition video, 'S' indicates a scary transition video, and '?' indicates an undecided transition video. The input guarantees that the i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j, and there are at most floor(n/2) characters that are 'F' or 'S'.
