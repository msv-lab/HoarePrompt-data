Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` which is 2 and `a[2]` which is 1, `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `b[1]` which is 2 if `x[0]` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `x` is the value of the user's input, `j` is 2**.

In simpler terms, the value of `a[2]` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
