The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given that `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute for `j` values from 1 to `n`. So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 2.

State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is a string containing the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` (or both) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
