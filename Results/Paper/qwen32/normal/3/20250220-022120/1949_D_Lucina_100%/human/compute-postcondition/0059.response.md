The code snippet appends the value of `x` to the list `xx`. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a list where `a[k]` is the count of 'F' in positions `k-1` to `n-1` of `x`, and `b` is a list where `b[k]` is the count of 'S' in positions `k-1` to `n-1` of `x`. `xx` has `x` appended to it.**
