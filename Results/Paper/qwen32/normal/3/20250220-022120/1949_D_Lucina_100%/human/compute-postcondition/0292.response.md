Postcondition: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, a list of `n` strings is constructed by replacing '?' in the corresponding row of `xx` with 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions involving `sa` and `sb`. Otherwise, the list of strings is `["FFF?", "FSFS", "FFSF", "FSFF"]`. `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.**
