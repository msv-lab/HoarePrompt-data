Postcondition: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sa` includes the value 4. Otherwise, `sa` remains unchanged. If `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `sb` includes the value 4. `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 4.**
