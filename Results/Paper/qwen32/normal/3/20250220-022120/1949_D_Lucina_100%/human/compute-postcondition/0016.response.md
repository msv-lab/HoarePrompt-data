The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range `1, n + 1`, so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range `1, n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since the range is `1, n + 1`, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` which is 1 and `a[j]` is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `b[1]` which is 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `x` is the value of the user's input, `j` is 2**
