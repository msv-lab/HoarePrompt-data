The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of `d[i]` to 1, overwriting any existing value for `d[i]`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is directly affected by this code is `d`. Specifically, `d[i]` is set to 1, which means if `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is now 1; if `i` was not a key in `d`, it is added with the value 1.

The other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `shapes`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` (and now includes `i_next` if `i` was not already in `pl`), `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is 1 (and other key-value pairs are unchanged), `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, and `i` is `i_next_next`**.
