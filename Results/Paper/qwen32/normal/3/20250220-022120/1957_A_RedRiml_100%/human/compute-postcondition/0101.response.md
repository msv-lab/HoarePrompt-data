The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it iterates over the elements in the list `palka`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in `palka`.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration `i` is `i_next`, the next value of `i` should be the subsequent element in the list `palka` after `i_next`. Let's denote this subsequent element as `i_next_next`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_next`.
2. **Determine the next state**: For the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `palka` after `i_next`.

Since we do not have specific values for `palka` or `i_next`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next element in the list.

State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` (and now includes `i_next` if `i` was not already in `pl`), `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `d[i]` already exists, otherwise `d[i]` is set to 1, and other key-value pairs are unchanged, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, and `i` is `i_next_next`**
