### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the provided sticks. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and then the list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Frequencies**:
   - It uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length in the list `palka`.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating the Number of Polygons**:
   - For each unique stick length `j` in `pl`, it checks if there are at least three sticks of that length (`d[j] >= 3`).
   - If so, it calculates how many polygons can be formed using these sticks by performing integer division `d[j] // 3` and adds this value to the `shapes` counter.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, it prints the value of `shapes`, which represents the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the sticks of that test case.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Polygon Formation**: The program correctly identifies that a polygon requires at least three sides. Therefore, it only considers stick lengths that appear at least three times.
- **Counting Polygons**: The division `d[j] // 3` correctly calculates the number of polygons that can be formed from the sticks of length `j`.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program processes each test case independently, resetting the necessary variables (`pl`, `d`, `shapes`) for each new test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It accurately counts the number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks.

### Correctness: **True**
