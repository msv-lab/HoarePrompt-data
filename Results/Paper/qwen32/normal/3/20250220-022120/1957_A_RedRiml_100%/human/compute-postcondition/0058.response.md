Postcondition: **`w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with at least one more element to process, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now has the key `i` set to 1. Otherwise, the count of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. `i` is the next element in `palka` to be processed.**
