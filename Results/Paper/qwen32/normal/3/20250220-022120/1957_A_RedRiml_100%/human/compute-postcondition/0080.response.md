To determine the output of the `print(shapes)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the transformations applied to the variables.

### Initial State Recap:
- `w` is defined as `w_initial + n`.
- `ln` is an input integer.
- `palka` is an input list of integers.
- `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- `d` is a dictionary where each unique element from `palka` is a key, and the corresponding value is the count of that element in `palka`.
- `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.

### Calculation of `shapes`:
The variable `shapes` is calculated by summing up the integer division of the count of each unique element in `palka` by 3, but only for those elements whose count is 3 or more.

### Explanation:
1. **`pl`**: This list contains all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
2. **`d`**: This dictionary maps each unique element from `palka` to its count.
3. **`shapes` Calculation**:
   - For each unique element `j` in `pl`:
     - If the count of `j` (i.e., `d[j]`) is 3 or more, add `d[j] // 3` to `shapes`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's say `palka` is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.
- `pl` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- `d` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}`.
- For `shapes`:
  - `j = 1`, `d[1] = 1` (less than 3, so no contribution to `shapes`).
  - `j = 2`, `d[2] = 2` (less than 3, so no contribution to `shapes`).
  - `j = 3`, `d[3] = 3` (contributes `3 // 3 = 1` to `shapes`).
  - `j = 4`, `d[4] = 4` (contributes `4 // 3 = 1` to `shapes`).
- Therefore, `shapes = 1 + 1 = 2`.

### General Case:
Given the initial state and the transformation rules, the value of `shapes` is the sum of integer divisions of counts of elements in `palka` by 3, but only for those elements whose counts are 3 or more.

### Output:
Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of d[j] // 3 for each unique element j in pl where d[j] >= 3)**
