The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which iterates over `pl`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `pl` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`, and `shapes`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `pl` must contain at least one integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element; `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`; `shapes` is 0**
