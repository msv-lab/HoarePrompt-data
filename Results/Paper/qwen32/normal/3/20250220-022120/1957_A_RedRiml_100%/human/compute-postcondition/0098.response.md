Postcondition: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `d[i]` already exists, otherwise `d[i]` is set to 1, and other key-value pairs are unchanged, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, `i` is `i_next`.**
