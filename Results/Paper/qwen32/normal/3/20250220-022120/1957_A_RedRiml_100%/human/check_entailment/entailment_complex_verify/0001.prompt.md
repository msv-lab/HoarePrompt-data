You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: The final value of `shapes` is the cumulative sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3` across all `w` iterations. `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `d` will reflect the state of the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates how many sets of three identical integers can be formed from the list and prints this count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

**Problem Analysis:**
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks, where each side of a polygon is exactly one stick and no stick is reused. A regular polygon must have at least 3 sides, so we need at least 3 sticks of the same length to form one polygon.

**Program Analysis:**
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `w`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of sticks, `n`.
   - It reads the lengths of the sticks and stores them in a list, `palka`.
   - It initializes an empty list `pl` and a dictionary `d`.
3. The program then iterates over each stick length in `palka` to:
   - Count the occurrences of each stick length using the dictionary `d`.
   - Add the unique stick lengths to the list `pl`.
4. Next, it initializes a variable `shapes` to 0, which will keep track of the number of polygons.
5. It iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl` to:
   - Check if the count of a particular stick length (from the dictionary `d`) is at least 3.
   - If so, it adds the integer division of the count by 3 to `shapes`. This is because each set of 3 sticks of the same length can form one polygon.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `shapes` for each test case.

**Correctness Check:**
- The program correctly counts the number of sticks of each length.
- It correctly identifies the unique stick lengths.
- It correctly calculates the number of polygons that can be formed by integer division of the count of sticks of each length by 3, ensuring that only complete polygons are counted.
- The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement (e.g., when there are fewer than 3 sticks, or when there are no sticks of the same length).

Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem.

**Final Answer:**
Reasoning: The program correctly counts the number of sticks of each length, identifies unique stick lengths, and calculates the maximum number of polygons that can be formed. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
Correctness: **True**
