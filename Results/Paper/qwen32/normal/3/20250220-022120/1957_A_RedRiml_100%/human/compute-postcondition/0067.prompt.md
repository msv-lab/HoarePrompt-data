Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes `i`, and if `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`; otherwise, the value associated with key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` and `d` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with at least one more element to process, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now has the key `i` set to 1. Otherwise, the count of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. `i` is the next element in `palka` to be processed. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` includes the element `i` as its new last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with at least one more element to process, `d` is a dictionary, and `i` is the next element in `palka` to be processed. If `i` was not already a key in `d`, `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the count of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes `i` as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
