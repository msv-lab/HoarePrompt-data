The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. If `i` does not exist in `d`, it will be added with the value 1.

Given the initial state:
- `w` is `w_initial + n - 1`
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element
- `pl` contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` (and now includes `i_next` if `i` was not already in `pl`)
- `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `d[i]` already exists, otherwise `d[i]` is set to 1, and other key-value pairs are unchanged
- `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`
- `i` is `i_next_next`

After executing `d[i] += 1`, the value of `d[i]` will be incremented by 1. The values of other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `pl` contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` (and now includes `i_next` if `i` was not already in `pl`); `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1 (if `i` existed, it is now `d[i] + 1`; if `i` did not exist, it is now 1); other key-value pairs in `d` are unchanged; `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`; `i` is `i_next_next`.**
