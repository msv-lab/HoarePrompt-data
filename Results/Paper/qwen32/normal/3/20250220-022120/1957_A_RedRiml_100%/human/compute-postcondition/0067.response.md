Let's analyze the loop and the given information to determine the final output state after all iterations are complete.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `palka`. For each element, it performs the following actions:
1. Checks if `i` is a key in the dictionary `d`. If not, it adds `i` to `d` with a value of 1. If `i` is already a key in `d`, it increments the value associated with `i` by 1.
2. Checks if `i` is in the list `pl`. If not, it appends `i` to `pl`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to process each element in `palka` until all elements have been processed. Thus, after all iterations, `d` will contain a count of each unique element in `palka`, and `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.

Let's assume `palka` contains `n` elements. After all iterations:
- `w` will be `w_initial + n`, where `w_initial` is the initial value of `w` before the first iteration.
- `ln` remains unchanged as it is an input integer and not modified by the loop.
- `palka` remains unchanged as it is the input list and not modified by the loop.
- `pl` will be a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- `d` will be a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and each value is the count of that element in `palka`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n`, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the input list of integers, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `d` is a dictionary with each unique element from `palka` as keys and their counts as values.**
