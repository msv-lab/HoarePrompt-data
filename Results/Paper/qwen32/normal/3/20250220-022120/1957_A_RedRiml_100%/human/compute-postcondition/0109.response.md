The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it iterates over the elements of the list `pl`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `pl` must contain at least one element. The states of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`, and `shapes` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique element in `palka`, `shapes` is 0**
