Postcondition: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique element in `palka`. If `d[j] >= 3`, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.**
