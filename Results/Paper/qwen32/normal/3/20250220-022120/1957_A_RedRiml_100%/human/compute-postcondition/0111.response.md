The code snippet `shapes += d[j] // 3` increments the value of `shapes` by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. Given that the initial value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, the value of `shapes` will increase accordingly.

Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique element in `palka`, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`.**
