To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` at the point where the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: At least 1 (not directly used in the print statement).
2. **`n`**: Greater than 0.
3. **`mak2`**: The largest `i` for which the input was `<`.
4. **`i`**: Set to `n-1`.
5. **`mak`**: 
   - If `s` is `'<'`, then `mak` is set to `n-2`.
   - Otherwise, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<` before the `if` statement.
6. **`s`**: The new input string.
7. **`pans`**: A list that changes based on the value of `s`:
   - If `s` is `'<'`, `pans` contains the single element `i`.
   - If `s` is `'='`, `pans` contains the elements `i` and `n-1`.
   - If `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `pans` remains unchanged from its initial state.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

- **`mak`**: This depends on the value of `s`:
  - If `s` is `'<'`, `mak` is `n-2`.
  - If `s` is not `'<'`, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<` before the `if` statement.
- **`mak2`**: The largest `i` for which the input was `<` (remains unchanged regardless of the value of `s`).
- **`i`**: Always `n-1`.
- **`mak2`**: Repeated, so it is the same as the previous `mak2`.

### Output Determination:
- **`mak`**: We don't have a specific value for `mak` without knowing `s`, but we can describe it based on the conditions.
- **`mak2`**: This is a specific value, the largest `i` for which the input was `<`.
- **`i`**: Always `n-1`.
- **`mak2`**: Repeated, same as the previous `mak2`.

### Final Output:
Since we don't have the exact value of `mak` without knowing `s`, we describe it based on the conditions provided.

Output: **? [mak (where mak is n-2 if s is '<', otherwise the largest i for which the input was '<' before the if statement)], [mak2 (the largest i for which the input was '<')], [n-1], [mak2 (the largest i for which the input was '<')]**
