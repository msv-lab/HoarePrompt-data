Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1.
- `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements where the input was '=' and the last index `i` where the input was `<` (if any).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`pans[mak]`**: 
   - `mak2` is defined as the largest `i` for which the input was `<`. 
   - Therefore, `pans[mak]` is the value at the index `mak` in the `pans` list, which corresponds to the last index where the input was `<`.

2. **`pans[i]`**: 
   - `i` is `n`, which is the integer value of the new input minus 1.
   - Therefore, `pans[i]` is the value at the index `n` in the `pans` list, which corresponds to the last element added to the `pans` list based on the new input.

### Output:
The print statement will output a string starting with `'?'` followed by four values:
- The value at the index `mak` in the `pans` list (which is the last index where the input was `<`).
- The value at the index `mak` in the `pans` list again (same as the previous).
- The value at the index `n` in the `pans` list (which is the last element added to the `pans` list based on the new input).
- The value at the index `n` in the `pans` list again (same as the previous).

### Final Output Description:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[mak] is the value at the last index where the input was '<' and pans[i] is the last element added to the pans list based on the new input)**
