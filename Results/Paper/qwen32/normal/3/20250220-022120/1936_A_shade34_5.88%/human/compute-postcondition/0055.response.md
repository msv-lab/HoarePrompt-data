Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t` is at least 1**: This tells us that `t` is a positive integer starting from 1.
2. **`n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `i`**: This means `n` is at least as large as `i`.
3. **`mak` is 0**: This is a counter or index variable initialized to 0.
4. **`i` is `n-1`**: This means `i` is set to the last index of a list or array of size `n`.
5. **`mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`**: Since `mak` is 0, `mak2` is also 0.
6. **`pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists, and `pans` must have at least 2 elements**: This means `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements. The first element is the last index where the input was '<', and the subsequent elements are indices where the input was '='.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

- **`pans[mak]`**: Since `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`. According to the initial state, `pans[0]` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<'.
- **`pans[i]`**: Since `i` is `n-1`, `pans[i]` is `pans[n-1]`. According to the initial state, `pans` has at least 2 elements, and all elements after the first one (`pans[0]`) are indices where the input was '='. Therefore, `pans[n-1]` is the last index in `pans` which is an index where the input was '='.

### Output Determination:
- The first element printed is a literal question mark `'?'`.
- The next two elements are `pans[0]`, which is the last index where the input was '<'.
- The last two elements are `pans[n-1]`, which is the last index in `pans` where the input was '='.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]] (where pans[0] is the last index where the input was '<' and pans[n-1] is the last index in pans where the input was '=')**
