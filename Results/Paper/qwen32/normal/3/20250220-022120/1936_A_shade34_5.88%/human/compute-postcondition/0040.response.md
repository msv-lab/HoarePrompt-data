The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n`. Therefore, `pans` will have `n` appended to it.

Since `pans` was initially `[n-1]` if `s` was '<' or '=', or an empty list otherwise, after appending `i` (which is `n`), `pans` will be `[n-1, n]` if `s` was '<' or '=', or simply `[n]` if `pans` was initially an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the input string, `pans` is `[n-1, n]` if `s` was '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is `[n]`.**
