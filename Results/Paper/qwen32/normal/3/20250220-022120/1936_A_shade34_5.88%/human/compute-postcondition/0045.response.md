Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the input string. If `s` was '<', `pans` is `[n]`. If `s` was '=', `pans` is `[n-1, n]`. If `s` was neither '=' nor '<', `pans` is `[n-1]` if `s` was '<' (which is already covered), or remains an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values and states.
