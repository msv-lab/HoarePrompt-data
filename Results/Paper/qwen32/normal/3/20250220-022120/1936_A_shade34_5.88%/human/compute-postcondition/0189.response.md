The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we need to adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n-1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-2` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<` before the if statement. If `s` is `'<'`, `pans` contains the single element `i`. If `s` is `'='`, `pans` contains the elements `i` and `n-1`. If `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `pans` remains unchanged from its initial state, which could be a list containing `i` if `s` was `'<'` initially, a list containing `n-1` if `s` was `'='` initially, or an empty list if `s` was neither `'<'` nor `'='` initially. `s` is the new input string.**
