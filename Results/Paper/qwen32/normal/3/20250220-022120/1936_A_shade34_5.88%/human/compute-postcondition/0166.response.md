The code snippet assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. Therefore, the value of `mak2` is now the same as the value of `mak`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was <, `i` is n-1, `mak` is the largest i for which the input was <.**
