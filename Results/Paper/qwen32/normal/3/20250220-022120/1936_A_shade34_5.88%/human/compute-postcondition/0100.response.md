The value of `mak` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is the same as `mak` (which is `n-1`), `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the input string, and the current value of `s` is `'<'`.
