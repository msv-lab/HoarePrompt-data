The code provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

Since `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`.**
