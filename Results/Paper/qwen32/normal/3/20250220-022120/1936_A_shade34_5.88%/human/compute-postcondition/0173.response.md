The code `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`. Therefore, after executing the code, `mak` will have the value `n-1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was <, `i` is n-1, `mak` is n-1, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the input string and it is equal to '<'**.
