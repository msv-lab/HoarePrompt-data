To determine the output of the print statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: At least 1 (though its exact value isn't needed for this specific print statement).
2. **n**: The integer value of the new input minus 1.
3. **mak2**: The largest `i` for which the input was `<`.
4. **i**: Set to `n + 1`.
5. **pans**: A list containing at least 2 elements where the input was `=` and the last index `i` where the input was `<` (if any).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak2` is the largest index `i` where the input was `<`.
- `i` is set to `n + 1`.

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the variable names used in the initial state and the print statement. Specifically, the print statement uses `mak` instead of `mak2`. Let's assume `mak` is the same as `mak2` based on the context.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **pans[mak]**: This will print the element at the index `mak` in the list `pans`. Since `mak` is the largest index where the input was `<`, this will be the value at that specific index in `pans`.
2. **pans[mak]**: This will print the same value as `pans[mak]` because it's accessing the same index.
3. **pans[i]**: This will print the element at the index `i` in the list `pans`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, this will be the value at index `n + 1` in `pans`.
4. **pans[i]**: This will print the same value as `pans[i]` because it's accessing the same index.

### Final Output Description:
The print statement will output a question mark (`?`) followed by the value at index `mak` in the list `pans` twice, and then the value at index `i` (which is `n + 1`) in the list `pans` twice.

### Output:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[n + 1]] [pans[n + 1]] (where mak is the largest index where the input was '<' and n is the integer value of the new input minus 1)**
