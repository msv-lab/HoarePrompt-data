The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`, and `pans` is either `[n-1]` or an empty list, depending on the value of `s`. After the execution of the code, `pans` will contain `n-1` at least once.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `n-1` if the current value of `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` existed, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is `[n-1, n-1]` if the current value of `s` is `'<'` or `s` is `'='`, otherwise `pans` is `[n-1]`, and `s` is the input string.**
