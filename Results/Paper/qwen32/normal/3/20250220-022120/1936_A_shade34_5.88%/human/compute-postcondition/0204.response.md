Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1, `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, and `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements where the input was '=' and the last index `i` where the input was `<` (if any). The current input is `'>'`.**

In natural language, the value of `mak` has been updated to be equal to `i`, which is `n-1`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
