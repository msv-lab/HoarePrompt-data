Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n`, and `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` if no `'<'` was encountered, or it contains the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'` if a `'<'` was encountered.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `mak` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
