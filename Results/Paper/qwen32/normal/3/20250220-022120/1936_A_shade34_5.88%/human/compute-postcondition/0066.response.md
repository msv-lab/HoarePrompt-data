Let's break down the problem step by step using the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `i`.
- `mak` is determined based on the input:
  - If the input was '>', `mak` is set to `n`.
  - If the input was not '>', `mak` is set to `n-1`.
- `mak2` is set to the previous value of `mak`.
- `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=':
  - It also includes the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists.
  - `pans` must have at least 3 elements.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

### Given Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- `mak` is either `n` or `n-1` depending on the input.
- `pans` is a list with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but since we don't know the exact value of `i` before the increment, let's denote the original `i` as `i_original` and the incremented `i` as `i = i_original + 1`.

### Determining the Values:
1. **`pans[mak]`**:
   - If the input was '>', `mak` is `n`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, and `pans` has at least 3 elements, `pans[n]` is a valid index if `n` is within the bounds of `pans`.
   - If the input was not '>', `mak` is `n-1`. Similarly, `pans[n-1]` is a valid index if `n-1` is within the bounds of `pans`.

2. **`pans[i]`**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i = i_original + 1`. Since `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `pans[i]` is valid if `i` is within the bounds of `pans`.

### Output:
Given the constraints and the fact that `pans` has at least 3 elements, we can infer the following:
- `pans[mak]` will be an element of `pans` at index `mak` (either `n` or `n-1`).
- `pans[i]` will be an element of `pans` at index `i` (which is `i_original + 1`).

Since the exact values of `mak` and `i` are not specified, we can describe the output in terms of the list `pans`:

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak is n if input was '>', otherwise n-1, and i is i_original + 1)**

This output reflects the precise values that will be printed based on the given initial state.
