The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. 

Given the initial state, `pans` already contains certain elements based on the value of `s`:
- If `s` was `'<'`, `pans` contains the single element `i`.
- If `s` was `'='`, `pans` contains the elements `i` and `n-1`.
- If `s` was neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `pans` remains unchanged.

After appending `i` to `pans`, the new state of `pans` will be:
- If `s` was `'<'`, `pans` will now contain two elements: `[i, i]`.
- If `s` was `'='`, `pans` will now contain three elements: `[i, n-1, i]`.
- If `s` was neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `pans` will now contain one additional element `i`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `i`, `mak`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-2` if `s` was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<` before the if statement, `s` is the new input string, `pans` contains `[i, i]` if `s` was `'<'`, `[i, n-1, i]` if `s` was `'='`, or `pans` with one additional element `i` if `s` was neither `'<'` nor `'='`.**
