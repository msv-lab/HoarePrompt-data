Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is at least 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<'.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `s` is the input string. Depending on the value of `s`:
     - If `s` was '<', `pans` is `[n]`.
     - If `s` was '=', `pans` is `[n-1, n]`.
     - If `s` was neither '=' nor '<', `pans` is `[n-1]` if `s` was '<' (which is already covered), or remains an empty list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<'.
   - `mak2` is explicitly stated to be equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is explicitly stated to be `n`.

4. **Output Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement outputs the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.
   - Given that `mak2` is equal to `mak` and `i` is `n`, the output will be:
     - `'?'`, `mak`, `mak`, `n`, `mak`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [n] [mak] (where mak is the largest i for which the input was '<' and n is greater than 0)**
