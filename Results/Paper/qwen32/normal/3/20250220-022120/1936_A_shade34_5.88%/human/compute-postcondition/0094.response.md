The code snippet provided assigns an empty list `[]` to the variable `pans`. This means that the value of `pans` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` existed, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n-1`, and `pans` is an empty list.**
