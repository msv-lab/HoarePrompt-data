The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the internal buffer of the standard output, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, this command does not affect any of the variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `i`, `pans`, and `mak` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, and `pans` is a list containing at least `n + 2` elements. If the input is '>', then `mak` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
