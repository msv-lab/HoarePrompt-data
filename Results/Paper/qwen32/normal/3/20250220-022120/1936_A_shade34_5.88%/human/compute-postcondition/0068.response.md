The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Other variables remain unchanged. Given that `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, `mak` now holds this new value of `i`. The other conditions and values of the variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`) remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mak` is `i + 1`, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `i + 1`**.
