Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<'.
- `i` is `n`.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `s` is the input string. If `s` is equal to '<' or '=', `pans` is `[n-1]`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

From the initial state, we can derive the following:
- `mak` is the largest index `i` where the input string `s` was '<'.
- `mak2` is explicitly set to `mak`.
- `i` is explicitly set to `n`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:
- The first argument is a literal `'?'`.
- The second argument is `mak`, which is the largest index where the input string `s` was '<'.
- The third argument is `mak2`, which is the same as `mak`.
- The fourth argument is `i`, which is `n`.
- The fifth argument is `mak2` again, which is the same as `mak`.

So the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [n] [mak] (where [mak] is the largest index where the input string s was '<' and [n] is the value of n)**
