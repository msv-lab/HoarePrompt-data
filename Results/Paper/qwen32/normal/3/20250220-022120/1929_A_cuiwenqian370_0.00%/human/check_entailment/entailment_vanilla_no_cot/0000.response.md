To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its approach and verify if it matches the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

### Key Insight:
To maximize the beauty, you should try to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. One effective strategy is to arrange the elements in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach helps in maximizing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows a strategy that attempts to maximize the beauty by arranging elements in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest remaining elements. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program starts by sorting the array.
2. **Alternating Pattern**: It then creates a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
3. **Calculating Beauty**: Finally, it calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `1 2 3`
   - Alternating: `3 1 2`
   - Beauty: `(3 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 2 + 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `69 69 69`
   - Alternating: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Alternating: `100 43 90 54 80`
   - Beauty: `(100 - 43) + (90 - 43) + (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) = 57 + 47 + 11 + 26 = 141 - 84 = 57`
   - Output: `57` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
   - Alternating: `4 3 3 3`
   - Beauty: `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 2`
   - Alternating: `2 1`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by following the strategy of arranging elements in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest remaining elements.

**Correctness: True**
