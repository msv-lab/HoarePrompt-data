Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

Explanation: The list `arr` has been sorted in non-decreasing order, meaning the smallest integer is at the beginning of the list and the largest integer is at the end. The values of `n` and the range of each integer in `arr` remain unchanged.
