Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, where each integer in `arr` is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive. It returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a new list `new_arr` that is constructed by arranging the elements of `arr` in a specific order: starting with the largest element, then the smallest, followed by the second largest, second smallest, and so on.**
