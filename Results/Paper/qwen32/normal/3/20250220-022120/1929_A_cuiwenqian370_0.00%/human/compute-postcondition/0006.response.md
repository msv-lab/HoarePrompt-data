Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, i.e., `new_arr` is `[arr[n-1]]`; `left` is equal to `right`, and both are equal to `n - 1`**.

In natural language: The value of `n` remains unchanged. The list `arr` remains unchanged and is still sorted in non-decreasing order. The list `new_arr` now contains the last element of `arr`, which is `arr[n-1]`. The variables `left` and `right` remain equal to `n - 1`.
