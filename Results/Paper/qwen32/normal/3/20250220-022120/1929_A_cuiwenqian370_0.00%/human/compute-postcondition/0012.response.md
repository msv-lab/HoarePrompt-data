Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, i.e., `new_arr` is `[arr[n-1]]`, and both `left` and `right` are equal to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `new_arr` is a list containing the largest element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`, `left` is 1, and `right` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if `left` equals `right` initially, both `left` and `right` will now be `n - 2`. If `left` and `right` were not equal initially, `right` will now be `n - 2`. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged.
