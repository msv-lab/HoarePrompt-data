The given code snippet appends the element at the `left` index of `arr` to `new_arr`. Since `left` is incremented by 1 before this operation, the element being appended is the one at the new `left` position. The `right` index is decremented by 1, but this does not affect the current operation of appending to `new_arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. `left` is incremented by 1, `right` is decremented by 1, and `new_arr` includes the element `arr[left]` appended to it. If `left` was equal to `right`, `new_arr` also includes the element `arr[right]` appended to it.**
