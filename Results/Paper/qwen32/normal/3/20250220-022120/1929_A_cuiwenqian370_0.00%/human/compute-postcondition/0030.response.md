The code snippet modifies the value of `max_beauty` by adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` to it. The other variables (`new_arr`, `left`, `right`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not directly modified in the provided code snippet.

The value of `i` is not defined in the given initial state, but based on the context, it is implied that `i` is an index used to access elements in `new_arr`. Since the exact value of `i` is not given, we can only describe the change in `max_beauty` in terms of `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`new_arr` is a list of `n` integers where elements are arranged in the order of largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on, starting with the largest element; `left` is `n`; `right` is `n - 1`; `max_beauty` is updated to `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])`; `n` must be greater than 1**.
