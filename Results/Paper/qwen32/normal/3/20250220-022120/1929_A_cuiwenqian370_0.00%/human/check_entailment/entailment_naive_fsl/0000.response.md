Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to strategically place the largest and smallest elements in the array to maximize the beauty.

2. **Alternating Placement**: The program then alternates between placing the largest and smallest elements in the new array. This is done by using two pointers, `left` and `right`, which start from the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively. By placing the largest and smallest elements alternately, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

3. **Calculating Beauty**: The beauty is calculated by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the newly arranged array. This ensures that the maximum possible beauty is achieved.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as arrays with all identical elements (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), where the beauty is `0` because all differences are `0`. It also handles arrays with only two elements, where the beauty is simply the absolute difference between the two elements.

5. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly processes multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and iterating through each one, storing the results and printing them at the end.

Overall, the provided code correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array and handles all the given constraints and examples appropriately. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
