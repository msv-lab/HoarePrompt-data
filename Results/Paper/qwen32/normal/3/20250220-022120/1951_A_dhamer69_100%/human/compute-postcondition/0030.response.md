To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the provided conditions:

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
   - `t` must be at least 2 (greater than 1).
   - `n` is the integer value of the input.
   - `s` is the new input string.
   - If `n` is equal to 2, then:
     - If `s` is equal to '00', `s` remains '00'.
     - Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'.
   - If `n` is not equal to 2, then:
     - `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`.
     - If `count_1` is odd, then the specific conditions of the if part are met.
     - If `count_1` is even, then either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2.

2. **Given Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

The provided code snippet simply prints the string 'NO'. There are no conditions or variables that affect the output of this print statement. The value 'NO' is explicitly given in the code.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **NO**
