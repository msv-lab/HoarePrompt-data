Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 1 (greater than 0); `n` is the integer value of the new input; `s` is the new input string. If `n` is equal to 2, `s` remains '00' if it was '00' initially, otherwise `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. `count_1` is updated to the number of '1's in `s`. If `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, the specific conditions of the if part are met; otherwise, the conditions of the else part are met, which are identical to the initial conditions except for the evaluation of the if statement.**

Since both the if part and the else part have the same postconditions, the overall postcondition of the if-else block retains the same state as described in the precondition with the evaluation of the if condition.
