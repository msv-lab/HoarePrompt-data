Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 2 (greater than 1); `n` is the integer value of the input; `s` is the new input string. If `n` is equal to 2, then if `s` is equal to '00', `s` remains '00'. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the specific conditions of the if part are met. If `count_1` is even, then either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2, and the specific conditions of the else part are met.**
