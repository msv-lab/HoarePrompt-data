Reasoning:
The provided Python program is not related to the problem description. The problem description describes a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that scans a directory for subfolders with numeric names within a specified range, and for each such folder, it scans for `.html` files and generates corresponding `-ac.py` and `-wa.py` files.

However, the given program defines a function `func` that appears to be solving a different problem. It reads input values, checks certain conditions based on the number of '1's in a binary string, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on those conditions. This function does not perform any directory scanning or file generation as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the given program does not solve the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
