`s` is assigned the value of the input string. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string.
Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string.**
