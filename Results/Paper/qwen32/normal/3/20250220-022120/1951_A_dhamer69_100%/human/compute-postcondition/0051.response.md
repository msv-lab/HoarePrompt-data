To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to focus on how the loop variable `t` changes. The loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration and continues until `t` is no longer greater than 0. Thus, the loop will execute exactly `t` times. 

Given that the initial state includes `t` as an input integer, after all iterations, `t` will be 0. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified by the loop's body. The variables `n` and `s` are inputs for each iteration and do not persist beyond a single iteration.

After all iterations, the final output state is:

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 0.**

In natural language: The final state is that `start` and `end` remain the same as they were initially, and the loop counter `t` is reduced to 0, indicating that all iterations have completed.
