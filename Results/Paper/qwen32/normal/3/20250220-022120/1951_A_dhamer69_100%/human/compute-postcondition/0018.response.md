Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
2. `t` is greater than 0.
3. `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2.
4. `s` is an input string.
5. `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`.
6. `count_1` is even.
7. Either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides conditions and constraints on the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`, but these do not affect the content of the print statement. The print statement is independent of these variables and directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
