Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers such that start <= end; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is `t - 1` (greater than 0); `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string. If `n` is equal to 2, then if `s` is equal to '00', `s` remains '00'. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, then the specific conditions of the if part are met. If `count_1` is even, then either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 1 (greater than 0); `n` is the integer value of the input; `s` is the new input string. If `n` is equal to 2, `s` remains '00' if it was '00' initially, otherwise `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the specific conditions of the if part are met. If `count_1` is even, either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2, and the specific conditions of the else part are met.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 0 (greater than or equal to 0); `n` is the integer value of the new input; `s` is the new input string. If `n` is equal to 2, `s` remains '00' if it was '00' initially, otherwise `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If `s` is '00', the specific conditions of the if part are met. Otherwise, if `count_1` is odd, the specific conditions of the if part are met. If `count_1` is even, either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2, and the specific conditions of the else part are met. If `count_1` is even and `s.count('11')` is 1 and `count_1` is 2, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` remain unchanged except for the evaluation of the if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
