Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t` and `h` equals '23', `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `h1` is '11', `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `time` is an empty string**

In simple terms, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1440, `h` is still '23', `m` retains its value as a string representing the minute part of `t`, `h1` is now '11', `m1` remains a string representing the minute part of `t`, and `time` remains an empty string.
