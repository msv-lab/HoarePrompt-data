The code snippet assigns the value `''` to `h1` and keeps `m1` unchanged. Therefore, the new state of `h1` is an empty string, and `m1` retains its previous value, which is `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the new input, `m` is the minute part of the new input, `m1` is `m`, `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' or '', `h1` is ''**.
