Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a time string in the format "hh:mm". It then converts this 24-hour format time to a 12-hour format with AM/PM and prints the result. The final state of the program is a series of printed lines, each showing the converted time for the corresponding test case.**
