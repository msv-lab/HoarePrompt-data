Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t`, `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, and `time` is a string. If `h` equals '23', then `h1` is '11', `m1` is the same as `m`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` is an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**
