The code snippet assigns the string 'AM' to the variable `time`. The values of other variables (`t`, `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t` and `h` is not equal to '01' or '02', `h` is currently '03', `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `h1` is '03', `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `time` is 'AM'**.
