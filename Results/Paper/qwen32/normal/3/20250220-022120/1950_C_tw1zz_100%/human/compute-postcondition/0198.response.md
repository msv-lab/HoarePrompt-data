Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `m1` is `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' or ''. If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '03' to '11', `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is `h` minus 12 with leading zero if necessary, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For any other value of `h`, `h1` is `h` and `time` remains ''.**
