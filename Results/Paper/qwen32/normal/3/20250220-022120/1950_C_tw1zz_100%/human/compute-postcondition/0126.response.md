The code assigns the value of `m` to `m1` and sets `h1` to an empty string. The values of `t`, `h`, `m`, `time`, and the condition for `time` based on `h` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '', `m1` is `m`, `time` is set to 'AM' for hours '00' to '11' and 'PM' for hours '12' to '23'.**
