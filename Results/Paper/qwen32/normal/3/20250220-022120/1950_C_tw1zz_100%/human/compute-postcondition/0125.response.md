The code snippet takes an input in the format of `h:m` (hour:minute) and splits it into two parts, `h` and `m`, which represent the hour and minute parts of the time, respectively. The initial state of `h` and `m` as strings representing the hour and minute parts of `t` is overwritten by the input values.

Given the initial state, the variables `h1` and `time` are derived based on the value of `h`. Since `h` is reassigned by the input, the derived values of `h1` and `time` will be recalculated based on this new `h`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is adjusted based on the new `h` value, and `time` is set to 'AM' for hours '00' to '11' and 'PM' for hours '12' to '23'. `m1` remains a string representing the minute part of `t`.**
