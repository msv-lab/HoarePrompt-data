Let's break down the provided initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440.
- `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t`.
- `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`.
- `h1` is derived from `h` based on specific conditions:
  - If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is any other valid hour from '02' to '23' or '00', `h1` is adjusted accordingly:
    - `time` is 'AM' for hours '02' to '11' and '00'.
    - `time` is 'PM' for hours '12' to '23'.
  - If `h` is none of the above, `h1` is an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.
- `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t` in all cases.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine `h` and `m` from `t`:**
   - `t` is the total number of minutes since midnight.
   - `h` can be derived as `str(t // 60)`, which gives the hour part.
   - `m` can be derived as `str(t % 60).zfill(2)`, which gives the minute part (always two digits).

2. **Determine `h1` and `time` based on `h`:**
   - If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is any value from '02' to '11', then `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is any value from '12' to '23', then `h1` is `h` if `h` is '12', otherwise `h1` is `str(int(h) - 12)` and `time` is 'PM'.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `t` is 1330 (which means 2:10 PM).

- `h = str(1330 // 60) = '22'`
- `m = str(1330 % 60).zfill(2) = '10'`
- Since `h` is '22', `h1` is `str(22 - 12) = '10'` and `time` is 'PM'.

### Output:
The `print` statement will concatenate `h1`, `':'`, `m`, `' '`, and `time` without any separators.

Given the example where `t` is 1330, the output would be:
Output: **10:10 PM**

However, since the exact value of `t` is not provided, we need to describe the output in a general form based on the given conditions.

### General Output Description:
- If `h` is '01', the output is `01:m AM`.
- If `h` is '00', the output is `12:m AM`.
- If `h` is any value from '02' to '11', the output is `h:m AM`.
- If `h` is any value from '12' to '23', the output is `h:m PM` if `h` is '12', otherwise `h-12:m PM`.

Since the exact value of `t` is not provided, we use the general form:

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the adjusted hour and time is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions)**
