You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: A series of printed lines, each in the format "h1:m time", representing the converted time for each of the `t` test cases. The variables `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will hold the values from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a time string in the format "hh:mm". It then converts this 24-hour format time to a 12-hour format with AM/PM and prints the result. The final state of the program is a series of printed lines, each showing the converted time for the corresponding test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly format the hour to always be two digits. For example, when the input is `00:00`, the program outputs `12:00 AM`, which is correct, but it does not handle other cases where the hour should have a leading zero in the 12-hour format. 

For example, if the input is `09:41`, the program correctly outputs `09:41 AM`, but it does not handle cases like `01:01` correctly because it outputs `01:01 AM` instead of `01:01 AM` (which is technically correct but does not maintain the leading zero for hours from 1 to 9). However, the main issue is with the conversion logic itself.

Another issue is the handling of the hour '12'. The program correctly outputs `12:14 PM` for `12:14` and `12:00 PM` for `12:00` but incorrectly outputs `12:00 AM` for `00:00` instead of `12:00 AM`. The conversion logic for '00' should be `12 AM` to match the problem description.

Here is a specific edge case that the program does not handle correctly:
- Input: `01:01`
- Expected Output: `01:01 AM`
- Actual Output: `01:01 AM` (This is correct, but the issue is with other cases)

Another example:
- Input: `13:01`
- Expected Output: `01:01 PM`
- Actual Output: `01:01 PM` (This is correct, but the issue is with other cases)

However, the main issue is with '00:00':
- Input: `00:00`
- Expected Output: `12:00 AM`
- Actual Output: `12:00 AM` (This is correct, but the conversion logic for other hours is not consistent)

The program does not consistently format the hour to always be two digits, which is a requirement of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

A correct implementation would handle all these cases and ensure that the hour is always two digits in the output.
