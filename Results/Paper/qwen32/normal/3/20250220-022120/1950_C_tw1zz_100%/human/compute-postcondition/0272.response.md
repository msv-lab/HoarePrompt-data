Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the new input, `m` is the minute part of the new input, `m1` is `m`. If `h` is '05', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '05'. If `h` is '06', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '06'. If `h` is one of '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is the same as `h`. If `h` is one of '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is `h` converted to 12-hour format. If `h` is '00', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '12'. For all other values of `h` except '05' to '23', `time` is '' and `h1` is ''.**
