Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `m1` is `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or '' or 'PM'. If `h` is '04', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '05', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '06', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '07', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '08', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '09' to '11', `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is `h` minus 12 with leading zero if necessary, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For any other value of `h`, `h1` is `h` and `time` remains ''.***
