Functionality: **The function `make_array` modifies a given array `arr` by assigning specific values to its elements between indices `left` and `right` (inclusive). The first half of this segment is filled with consecutive increasing integers starting from `left + 1`, and the second half is filled with consecutive decreasing integers starting from `right + 1`. Additionally, it assigns the `clique` number to all elements between indices `left` and `right` in another array `cliquess`.**
