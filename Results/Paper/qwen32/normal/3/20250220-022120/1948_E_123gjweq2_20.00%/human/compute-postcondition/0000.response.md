Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), and `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices will be assigned. `small_element` is `left + 1`.**

In the output state, the variable `small_element` has been assigned the value of `left + 1`, while the variables `left`, `right`, and `clique` retain their initial values and conditions.
