### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the given problem by creating a graph based on the integers assigned to vertices and then partitioning this graph into the minimum number of cliques. Here's a detailed analysis of the code and its correctness:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of vertices) and `k` (threshold for edge creation).

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
   - This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`, filled with zeros.
   - It then calls `make_array` for each segment of length `k` (or less for the last segment) to fill these lists.

3. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`:**
   - This function fills the segment of `arr` and `cliquess` from index `left` to `right` with consecutive integers and assigns them to the given `clique`.
   - It divides the segment into two parts: the first part with `mid` elements and the second part with `not_mid` elements.
   - The first part is filled with increasing integers starting from `small_element`, and the second part is filled with decreasing integers starting from `big_element`.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Assignment of `arr` and `cliquess`:**
   - The function `make_array` is supposed to fill `arr` and `cliquess` with values such that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - However, the current implementation does not guarantee that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` will be satisfied for all pairs `(i, j)` within each clique.
   - The values assigned to `arr` are not distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and the logic for assigning values does not ensure that the edges are added correctly based on the given condition.

2. **Printing Statements:**
   - The print statements inside `func_1` are incorrect. The `arr` and `cliquess` lists are not filled correctly, so printing them as they are will not produce the desired output.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` does not ensure that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, and the values assigned do not meet the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**

The provided code is incorrect due to the improper assignment of values to `arr` and `cliquess`, which does not satisfy the conditions required to form the correct graph and partition it into cliques.
