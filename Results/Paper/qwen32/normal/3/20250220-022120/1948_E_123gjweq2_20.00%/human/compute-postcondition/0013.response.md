To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and its effect on the array and the `cliquess` array.

The loop runs for `mid` iterations, where `mid` is calculated as `(big_element - small_element) // 2`. Given that `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` can be rewritten as:

\[ \text{mid} = \left(\frac{(right + 1) - (left + 1)}{2}\right) = \frac{right - left}{2} \]

This means the loop will execute `mid` times, and during each iteration `i`, the following assignments are made:
- `arr[left + i] = small_element + i`
- `cliquess[left + i] = clique`

Let's summarize the changes after `mid` iterations:
- For each `i` from 0 to `mid - 1`, `arr[left + i]` is set to `small_element + i`, which means `arr[left]` becomes `left + 1`, `arr[left + 1]` becomes `left + 2`, and so on up to `arr[left + mid - 1]` which becomes `left + mid`.
- Similarly, for each `i` from 0 to `mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`.

After all iterations, the state of the variables will be:
- `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The elements in `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to consecutive integers starting from `left + 1`.
- The elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to `clique`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i` for i from 0 to `mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for i from 0 to `mid - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, the elements in `arr` from index `left` up to `left + mid - 1` are filled with consecutive integers starting from `left + 1`, and the corresponding elements in `cliquess` are all set to `clique`. The other variables remain unchanged.
