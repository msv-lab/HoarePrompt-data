To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the array `arr` and the array `cliquess`.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates `not_mid` times. For each iteration `i`:
- `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`.

### Variables:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`.
- `clique` is an integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`.

### Initial State:
- `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`.

### Output State after All Iterations:
After the loop has executed all `not_mid` iterations, the following changes will have occurred:
- For `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`:
  - `arr[left + mid + i]` will be `big_element - i`.
  - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` will be `clique`.

### Final Output State:
- `arr[left + i]` will be `small_element + i` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`.
- `arr[left + mid + i]` will be `big_element - i` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` will be `clique` for `i` from `0` to `mid + not_mid - 1`.

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop completes all its iterations, the elements in the `arr` array from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will be filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element` down to `big_element - not_mid + 1`. The corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will all be set to `clique`. The elements in `arr` and `cliquess` before these indices will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`, `clique` is an integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `mid + not_mid - 1`.**
