The code assigns a new value to `big_element` by incrementing `right` by 1. The values of `left`, `clique`, and `small_element` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `big_element`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices will be assigned, `small_element` is `left + 1`, and `big_element` is `right + 1`.**
