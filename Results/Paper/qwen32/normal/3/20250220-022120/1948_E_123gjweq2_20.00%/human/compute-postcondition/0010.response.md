The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` to the next value that would allow the loop to execute again.

Let's break down the values:
- `mid` is calculated as `(big_element - small_element) // 2`.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.

Therefore, `mid` is `((right + 1) - (left + 1)) // 2` which simplifies to `(right - left) // 2`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. Since we are not given the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we assume that `i` was `i - 1` before it was incremented. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be `i - 1 + 1`, which is simply `i`.

However, since we need to adjust the state for the next iteration, we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is incremented by 1** 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` as the next integer.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is `i + 1`**

Since we need to specify the exact state, let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is `i + 1`**

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is incremented by 1**
