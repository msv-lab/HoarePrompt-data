The loop in the given code is controlled by the variable `i` and the constant `not_mid`. Specifically, the loop will execute `not_mid` times. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `not_mid` is greater than 0. 

Let's break down the provided state and determine the necessary adjustments:

- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`.
- `clique` is an integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`.
- `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`.

The loop will execute `not_mid` times, so `not_mid` must be greater than 0. Let's analyze `not_mid`:
\[ \text{not\_mid} = \frac{\text{right} - \text{left} + 2}{2} \]

For `not_mid` to be greater than 0, the numerator `right - left + 2` must be greater than 0, which is always true given the condition `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `not_mid` itself, as it will naturally be greater than 0 under the given conditions.

However, we need to ensure that the initial values of `left` and `right` satisfy the condition `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`. Since the problem statement already provides this condition, no adjustment is needed for `left` and `right` either.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute. We do not need to adjust any other variables in the loop head (`i` and `not_mid`).

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`, `clique` is an integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`**
