Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`, `clique` is an integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`**

In simple terms, the output state is that the initial conditions for `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged. The array `arr` is modified such that for indices from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`, the values are set to `big_element - i`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `not_mid - 1`. The array `cliquess` remains unchanged.
