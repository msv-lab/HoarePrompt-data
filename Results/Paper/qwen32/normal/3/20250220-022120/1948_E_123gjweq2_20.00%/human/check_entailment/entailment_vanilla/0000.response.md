Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Vertices and Edges Assignment**:
   - Assign integers `a_i` to vertices `i` such that `a_i` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - Add edges between vertices `(i, j)` if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   
2. **Clique Partitioning**:
   - Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex should belong to exactly one clique.
   - A clique is a set of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
- `func_1(n, k)`: This function aims to determine the number of cliques and assigns values to vertices and their respective cliques.
- `make_array(left, right, clique)`: This function fills in the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` for a specific range of vertices.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**:
   - The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used inside `make_array` but are not defined as global variables. This will lead to an error since Python treats variables defined inside a function as local unless explicitly declared as global.
   
2. **Clique Calculation**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. This might not always be the optimal number of cliques for the given problem.
   
3. **Array Filling**:
   - The `make_array` function attempts to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`. However, it does not ensure that the values of `a_i` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The values assigned to `arr` are not guaranteed to satisfy the edge condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` but does not ensure that the graph formed is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not ensure that the values assigned to vertices are distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and it does not guarantee that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
