Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is incremented by 1**

In natural language: The value of `arr[left + i]` is updated to `small_element + i`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and `cliquess[left + i]` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
