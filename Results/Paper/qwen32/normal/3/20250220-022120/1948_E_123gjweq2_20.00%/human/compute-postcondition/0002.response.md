Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices will be assigned, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged from the initial state. The new variable `mid` is calculated as `(big_element - small_element) // 2`.
