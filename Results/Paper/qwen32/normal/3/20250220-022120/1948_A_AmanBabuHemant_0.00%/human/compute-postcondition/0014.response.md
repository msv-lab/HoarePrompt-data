The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use within the loop body), and it is used in the `range(t)` function. The value of `_` does not need to be adjusted manually because it is automatically incremented by the `for` loop construct. However, the loop will continue to execute as long as the range has not been exhausted, which means `t` needs to be adjusted to reflect the number of remaining iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. Since the loop uses `range(t)`, the loop will execute `t` times. After each iteration, the loop variable `_` is incremented, but `t` itself remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, indicating that one iteration has just completed.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, then no additional changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, then `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is either less than 200 or 200 or more.**
