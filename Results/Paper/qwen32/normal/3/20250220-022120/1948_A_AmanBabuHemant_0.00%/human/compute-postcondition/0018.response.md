Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `(n // 2)` times.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the variables `t`, `n`, or `s`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Explanation:
Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, the values of `t`, `n`, and `s` do not affect the output in this case.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
