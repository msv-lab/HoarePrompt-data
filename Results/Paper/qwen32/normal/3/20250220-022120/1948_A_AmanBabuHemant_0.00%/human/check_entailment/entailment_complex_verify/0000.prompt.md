You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that `t` is 0; `n` is the input integer. If `n` is odd, the program does nothing further. If `n` is even, `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times, and `s` retains its initial value if its length is less than 200 or if its length is 200 or more.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring '110' `n // 2` times and checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If so, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate the required string of uppercase Latin letters where there are exactly `n` special characters. Here are the issues:

1. **Output Format**: The problem requires the string to be composed of uppercase Latin letters (A-Z), but the program generates a string composed of '1', '1', and '0', which do not meet the output requirements.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Special Characters**: The program incorrectly assumes that `n` must be even to construct a valid string. This is not true. For example, a string like "AAAB" has 3 special characters ('A' at positions 1, 3, and 4), and `n` is odd.

3. **String Length Constraint**: The program uses the string '110' * (n // 2), which does not guarantee that the number of special characters will be exactly `n` and does not generate a valid string according to the problem description.

Let's consider a test case where the program fails:

- **Test Case**: `n = 3`
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    YES
    AAAB
    ```
  - Actual Output:
    ```
    NO
    ```

The program incorrectly outputs "NO" for `n = 3`, even though a valid string "AAAB" exists.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem description for all potential cases.
