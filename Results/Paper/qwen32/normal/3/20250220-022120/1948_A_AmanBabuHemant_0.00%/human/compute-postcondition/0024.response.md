The code snippet provided is just an input statement that reads an integer from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` will change based on the user's input, but the values of `t` and `s` (if it was previously defined) will remain unchanged. Since `s` is only defined conditionally based on the value of `n` (which is not yet known at this point), we cannot determine its value or whether it will be defined or not. The value of `t` remains as it was initially.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 48; `n` is the input integer.**
