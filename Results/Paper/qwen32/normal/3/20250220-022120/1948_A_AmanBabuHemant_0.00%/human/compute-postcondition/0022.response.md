Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49 and `n` is the input integer. If `n` is odd, the program does nothing further. If `n` is even, `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `(n // 2)` times, and `s` retains its initial value if its length is less than 200 or if its length is 200 or more. `t` and `n` retain their initial values in both cases.**
