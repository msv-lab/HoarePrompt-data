The code snippet assigns the variable `s` the value of the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 48; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.**
