The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Values**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 48\).
   - `n` is an input integer.

2. **Examine the Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet contains only one line: `print('NO')`.

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement is independent of the variables `t` and `n`, the output will be exactly the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
