The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring '110' `n // 2` times and checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If so, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.
