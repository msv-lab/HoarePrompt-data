The given code snippet modifies the `ans` list by setting the element at index `i` to the value of the element at index `i + 1` minus the element at index `i` in the `arr` list. 

Initial State: 
- `arr` is a list of integers where each element \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \)
- `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \)
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `10`
- `i` is `n - 2`

After executing the code:
- `ans[i]` is updated to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`
- `ans[i + 1]` remains `10` (since it was not modified)
- `arr[i]` remains the same as it was before

Since `ans[i + 1]` is `10` and `arr[i]` is between `1` and `500`, `ans[i]` will be between `10 - 500` and `10 - 1`, which means `ans[i]` will be between `-490` and `9`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` and all other elements are `10`; `i` is `n - 2`.**
