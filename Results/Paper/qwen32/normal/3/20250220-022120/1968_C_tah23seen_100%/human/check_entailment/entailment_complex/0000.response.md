### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by generating an array \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \) for \( 2 \le i \le n \). The function `func_1` is supposed to generate this array.

Let's analyze the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   ans = [10 ** 9] * n
   ```
   Here, `ans` is initialized with a list of `n` elements, all set to \( 10^9 \).

2. **Loop**:
   ```python
   i = n - 2
   while i >= 0:
       ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
       i -= 1
   ```
   The loop starts from the second last element of `ans` (index `n-2`) and goes backward to the first element (index `0`). In each iteration, it sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

3. **Return**:
   ```python
   return ans
   ```
   The function returns the `ans` array.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The logic in the loop is incorrect. The goal is to make sure that `ans[i] % ans[i-1] == arr[i]`. The current implementation does not ensure this condition.
- For example, if `arr = [2, 4, 1]` and `n = 4`, the loop will set `ans[2] = ans[3] - arr[2]` (which is `10^9 - 1`), `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1]` (which is `10^9 - 1 - 4`), and `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0]` (which is `10^9 - 1 - 4 - 2`). This does not guarantee that `ans[i] % ans[i-1] == arr[i]`.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, one possible approach is to set `a_1` to a large number (e.g., \( 10^9 \)) and then set each subsequent `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} == x_i` because `a_i = a_{i-1} + k * a_{i-1} + x_i` for some integer `k`, and thus `a_i % a_{i-1} == x_i`.

### Conclusion:

The provided function does not correctly generate the required array `a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n` that satisfies the conditions given in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
