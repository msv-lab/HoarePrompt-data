You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, where Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

### Key Observations:

1. **MEX Definition**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she would try to include as many smaller numbers as possible in `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he would try to avoid letting Alice include smaller numbers in `c`.

### Strategy:

- If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once in the array `a`, Alice can ensure that the MEX is at least 2 by picking one of these numbers on her first turn and then allowing Bob to pick the other.
- If there is only one number that appears exactly once, Alice can ensure that the MEX is at least 1.
- If there are no numbers that appear exactly once, the MEX will be 0 because all numbers from 0 to `n-1` will be included in `c` at some point.

### Program Analysis:

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
```

1. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.
   
2. **Finding the MEX**:
   - It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `N` and counts how many numbers appear exactly once.
   - If it finds two numbers that appear exactly once, it returns the current number `i` as the MEX.
   - If it finds a number that does not appear in `a`, it also returns the current number `i` as the MEX.

### Correctness:

The logic of the program aligns with the strategy discussed above. Here's why:

- If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, the program will return the smallest such number, ensuring the MEX is at least 2.
- If there is only one number that appears exactly once, the program will return that number, ensuring the MEX is at least 1.
- If there are no numbers that appear exactly once, the program will return 0, which is the MEX when all numbers from 0 to `n-1` are included.

The program handles all edge cases and correctly determines the MEX based on the optimal play of both Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
