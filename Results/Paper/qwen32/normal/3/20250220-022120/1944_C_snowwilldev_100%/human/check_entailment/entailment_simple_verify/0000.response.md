### Reasoning:

Upon analyzing the provided program and its annotated version, it is clear that the program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob or compute the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal strategies of both players.

1. **Incorrect Functionality**:
    - The provided `func_1` function counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and tries to determine the MEX based on the count of numbers. However, this approach does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob during the game.
    - The function does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The function does not consider these strategic decisions.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
    - The MEX calculation in the function is flawed. The function returns the smallest index `i` where `cnt[i] == 0` or `t >= 2`. This does not correctly simulate the game and does not guarantee the optimal strategy for both players.
    - The function does not correctly simulate the game dynamics and does not ensure that the MEX is calculated based on the final state of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
    - The function does not implement the optimal strategy for both players. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The function does not consider the turns and the choices made by both players, which is crucial for determining the final MEX.

### Correctness of the Original Assessment:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob and does not compute the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal strategies of both players. The corrected version provided in the assessment correctly simulates the game and calculates the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
