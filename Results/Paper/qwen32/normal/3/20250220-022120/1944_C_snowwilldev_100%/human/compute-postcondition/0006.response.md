The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the `cnt` defaultdict.

Given the initial state:
- `N` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `a` is a list of integers
- `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int` and `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1

After executing the code snippet, the count of `a[1]` in the `cnt` defaultdict will be incremented by 1. The values of `N`, `a`, and the count of `a[0]` in `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1.**
