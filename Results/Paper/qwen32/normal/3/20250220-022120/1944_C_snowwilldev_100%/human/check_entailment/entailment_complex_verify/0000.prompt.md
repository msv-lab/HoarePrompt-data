You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i



- Annotated Code:

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: `N` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `i` is `N-1` after the final iteration, `a` is a list of integers, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int` where each key in `cnt` corresponds to an integer in `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns the smallest integer `i` such that the count of `i` in the array is 1, or the first integer `i` where the count of `i` is 0, or 3 if neither condition is met before reaching `i = N`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob, nor does it correctly compute the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal play strategy of both players.

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` does not simulate the game between Alice and Bob. It simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and then tries to determine the MEX based on the count of numbers. This approach does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob during the game.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation in the function is flawed. The function returns the smallest index `i` where `cnt[i] == 0` or `t >= 2`. This does not correctly simulate the game and does not guarantee the optimal strategy for both players.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The function does not implement the optimal strategy for both players. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The function does not consider the turns and the choices made by both players, which is crucial for determining the final MEX.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game with both players playing optimally. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def mex(c):
    i = 0
    while i in c:
        i += 1
    return i

def game_score(a):
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for num in a:
        cnt[num] += 1

    c = []
    turn = 0  # 0 for Alice, 1 for Bob

    while cnt:
        if turn == 0:  # Alice's turn
            # Alice picks the smallest number with an odd count
            for num in sorted(cnt):
                if cnt[num] % 2 == 1:
                    c.append(num)
                    cnt[num] -= 1
                    if cnt[num] == 0:
                        del cnt[num]
                    break
        else:  # Bob's turn
            # Bob picks any number
            num = next(iter(cnt))
            cnt[num] -= 1
            if cnt[num] == 0:
                del cnt[num]

        turn = 1 - turn

    return mex(c)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(game_score(a))
```

This corrected program correctly simulates the game with both players playing optimally and calculates the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game.
