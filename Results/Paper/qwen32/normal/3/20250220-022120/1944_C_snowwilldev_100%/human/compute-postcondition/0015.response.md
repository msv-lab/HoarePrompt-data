Postcondition: **`N` must be at least 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is set to 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0. Additionally, either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0.**
