The code snippet `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Given that `t` was initially 1, `t` will now be 2. The other variables (`N`, `a`, `cnt`, `cnt[i]`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int`, `t` is 2, `cnt[i]` is 1, `i` is 2**.
