Output State: **`N` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `i` is `N-1` after the final iteration, `a` is a list of integers, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int` where each key in `cnt` corresponds to an integer in `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. `t` is 0.**

The value of `t` has been set to 0, while all other variables (`N`, `i`, `a`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
