Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not properly simulate the game or calculate the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Game Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Alice tries to maximize the MEX, and Bob tries to minimize it. The current implementation does not account for this alternating strategy.

2. **Counting Elements**: The program counts the occurrences of each element in the array `a` but does not correctly use this information to determine the MEX. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `c` after all elements have been chosen.

3. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX should be calculated based on the final array `c`, which is determined by the choices made by Alice and Bob. The current implementation incorrectly calculates the MEX based on the counts of elements in the initial array `a`.

To fix the program, we need to simulate the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it. After all elements are chosen, we can then calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def mex(c):
    i = 0
    while i in c:
        i += 1
    return i

for tc in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    
    c = []
    turn = 0  # 0 for Alice, 1 for Bob
    
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] > 0:
            if turn == 0:  # Alice's turn
                c.append(i)
                cnt[i] -= 1
            else:  # Bob's turn
                cnt[i] -= 1
            turn = 1 - turn
    
    print(mex(c))
```

This corrected program simulates the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob and correctly calculates the MEX of the final array `c`.
