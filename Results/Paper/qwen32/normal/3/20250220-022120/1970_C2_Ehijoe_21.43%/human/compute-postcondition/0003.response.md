The code snippet `nodes = defaultdict(list)` reassigns the `nodes` variable to a new `defaultdict` object where the default value for each key is an empty list. This means that `nodes` is no longer the original dictionary provided in the initial state but a new `defaultdict` object.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where the default value for each key is an empty list; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, which is a key in the nodes dictionary; `n` and `t` are integers provided by the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True.**
