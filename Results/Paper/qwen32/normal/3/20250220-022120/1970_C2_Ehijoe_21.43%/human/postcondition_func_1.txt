The function reads input to construct a graph represented by a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors. It identifies leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection) and a starting node. It then processes the graph starting from the given node and determines if any of the resulting moves are odd. Based on this, it prints either "Ron" or "Hermione".
