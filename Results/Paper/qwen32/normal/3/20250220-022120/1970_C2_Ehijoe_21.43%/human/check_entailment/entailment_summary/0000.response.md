### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together meet the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the distances from a starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - It recursively explores each neighbor of the current node, excluding the parent node to avoid cycles.
   - If a node is a leaf (only one neighbor, which is its parent), it returns `[0]` indicating no distance from itself.
   - For other nodes, it calculates the distances to all reachable nodes and returns a list of these distances incremented by 1 (to account for the edge to the neighbor).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input values to construct the tree.
   - It identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection).
   - It reads the starting node where the stone is initially placed.
   - It calls `func_1` to get a list of distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - It checks if any of these distances are odd. If any are, Ron wins because he can make the last move. Otherwise, Hermione wins because Ron cannot make the last move.

### Analysis:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of moves available from the starting node.
- If any node can be reached in an odd number of moves, Ron can make the last move and win.
- If all reachable nodes are in an even number of moves, Hermione wins because Ron cannot make the last move.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
- The function `func_2` correctly uses these distances to determine the winner based on the parity of the distances.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree and determines the winner based on the parity of these distances.
Correctness: **True**
