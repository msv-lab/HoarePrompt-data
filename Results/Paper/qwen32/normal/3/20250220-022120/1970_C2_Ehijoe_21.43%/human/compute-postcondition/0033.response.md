Postcondition: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where each key `u` has a list of connected nodes `v` and must have at least one key-value pair; `leaves` is a deque that includes all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one element in their list of connected nodes; `start` is an input integer; `moves` is the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`. None of the elements in `moves` are odd numbers.**
