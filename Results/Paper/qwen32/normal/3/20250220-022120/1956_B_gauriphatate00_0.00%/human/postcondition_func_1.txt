The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a number `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and prints the result of processing each test case. The processing involves determining if the list `a` contains pairs of each integer from 1 through `n`. If it does, the function prints `True`; otherwise, it prints `False`.
