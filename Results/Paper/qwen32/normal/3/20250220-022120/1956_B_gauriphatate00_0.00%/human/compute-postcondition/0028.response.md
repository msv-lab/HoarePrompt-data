To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved.

### Given Initial State:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` from the last iteration.
- `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx - n - 1:idx - 1]` from the last iteration.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `idx` is the position right after the last processed segment of data.
- `t` is 0.
- `results` is a list containing at least two elements.
- `result` is the second element of `results`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `result` is explicitly stated to be the second element of the list `results`.
- Since `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` is well-defined and corresponds to `results[1]`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(result)` statement will output the second element of the list `results`.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is the second element of the list `results`)**
