The code appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list. This means that `results` now contains the output of `func_1(n, a)` twice, once from its initial state and once from the newly appended value.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `4 + 2*n`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)` twice.**
