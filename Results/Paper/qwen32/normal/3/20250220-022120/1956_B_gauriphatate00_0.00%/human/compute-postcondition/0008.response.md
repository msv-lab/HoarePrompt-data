The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `idx` is 1, so after the increment, `idx` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `idx` is 2, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list**.
