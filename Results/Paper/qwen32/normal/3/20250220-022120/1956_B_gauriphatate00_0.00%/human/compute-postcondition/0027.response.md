The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` has more than one element, the loop will execute again for the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `result` is the first element of `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least two elements, and `result` will be the second element of `results`.

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` from the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx - n - 1:idx - 1]` from the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is the position right after the last processed segment of data, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least two elements, and `result` is the second element of `results`**
