The code snippet provided updates the list `a` by mapping the elements of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given:
- Initial State: `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx - 1:idx + n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `5 + 2*n`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)` twice.

After executing the code:
- `a` is updated to be a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `5 + 2*n`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)` twice.**
