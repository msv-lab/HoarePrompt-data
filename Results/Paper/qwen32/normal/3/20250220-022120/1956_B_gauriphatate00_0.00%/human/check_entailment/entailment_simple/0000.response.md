### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score in a card game where you and Nene each receive `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards. Each card has an integer from `1` to `n`, and each integer appears exactly twice in the deck. The players take turns placing cards on the table, and you score a point if the card you play has already been placed on the table.

The key to solving this problem is understanding that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. For each test case, the function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of points you can score under optimal play. Here's how it works:

1. **Count Pairs**: The function uses `Counter(a)` to count how many times each integer appears in your hand.
2. **Calculate Pairs**: It calculates the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand (`pairs`).
3. **Determine Maximum Points**: The maximum number of points you can score is the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This is because:
   - `pairs` represents the number of integers that you can potentially score points on.
   - `n // 2` represents the maximum number of turns you have to play cards.

Nene, playing optimally, will ensure that you score the maximum possible points under these constraints. If there are more pairs than half of the cards you have, you can score up to `n // 2` points. Otherwise, you can score up to the number of pairs you have.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 4`, `a = [1, 1, 2, 3]`
  - `Counter(a) = {1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1}`
  - `pairs = 1` (only the number 1 appears twice)
  - `max_points = min(1, 4 // 2) = 1`
  - **Output**: `1`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 8`, `a = [7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 8, 5, 5]`
  - `Counter(a) = {7: 1, 4: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 8: 2, 5: 2}`
  - `pairs = 2` (numbers 8 and 5 appear twice)
  - `max_points = min(2, 8 // 2) = 2`
  - **Output**: `2`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 8`, `a = [7, 1, 4, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6]`
  - `Counter(a) = {7: 1, 1: 1, 4: 2, 5: 1, 3: 1, 2: 1, 6: 1}`
  - `pairs = 1` (only the number 4 appears twice)
  - `max_points = min(1, 8 // 2) = 1`
  - **Output**: `1`

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`
  - `Counter(a) = {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`
  - `pairs = 0` (no number appears twice)
  - `max_points = min(0, 3 // 2) = 0`
  - **Output**: `0`

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 1`, `a = [1]`
  - `Counter(a) = {1: 1}`
  - `pairs = 0` (no number appears twice)
  - `max_points = min(0, 1 // 2) = 0`
  - **Output**: `0`

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score for each test case based on the provided logic. The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the example test cases.

**Correctness: True**
