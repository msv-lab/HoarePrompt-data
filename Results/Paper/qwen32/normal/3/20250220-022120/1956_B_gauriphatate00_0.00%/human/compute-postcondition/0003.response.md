The code snippet `t = int(data[idx])` converts the string at index `idx` of the `data` list to an integer and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `data` remain unchanged, and `idx` remains 0 as no changes are made to it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `idx` is 0, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
