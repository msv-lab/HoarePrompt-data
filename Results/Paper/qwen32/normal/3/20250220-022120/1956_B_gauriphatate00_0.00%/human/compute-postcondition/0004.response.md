The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `idx` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
