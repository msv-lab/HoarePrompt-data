The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`. Since `idx` is 1, `n` is now the integer value of the second element in the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `idx` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list**.
