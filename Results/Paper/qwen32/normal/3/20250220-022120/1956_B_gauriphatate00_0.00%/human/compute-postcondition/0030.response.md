To determine what will be printed when the `print(result)` statement is executed, we need to analyze the given initial state and identify the value of the variable `result`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: This is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` from the last iteration.
   - **Value**: `n` is a specific integer derived from the list `data` at a specific index `idx - 1`.

2. **`a`**: This is a list of integers from `data[idx - n - 1:idx - 1]` from the last iteration.
   - **Value**: `a` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from index `idx - n - 1` up to `idx - 2`.

3. **`data`**: This is a list of strings.
   - **Value**: `data` is a list of strings, but the exact values are not specified.

4. **`idx`**: This is the position right after the last processed segment of data.
   - **Value**: `idx` is an integer indicating the current position in the list `data`.

5. **`t`**: This is set to 0.
   - **Value**: `t` is explicitly set to 0.

6. **`results`**: This is a list containing at least three elements.
   - **Value**: `results` is a list with at least three elements, but the exact values are not specified.

7. **`result`**: This is the third element of `results`.
   - **Value**: `result` is `results[2]`.

### Analysis:
The variable `result` is defined as the third element of the list `results`. Since the exact contents of `results` are not provided, we can only describe `result` in terms of its position within the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
The `print(result)` statement will print the third element of the `results` list.

Output: **result (where result is the third element of the results list)**
