To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the code correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score in a card game where each player (you and Nene) has `n` cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to `n` with each integer appearing exactly twice in the entire deck. The game consists of `2n` turns, with each player taking `n` turns. During each turn, a player selects a card from their hand, receives a point if there is already a card with the same integer on the table, and places the selected card on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.

### Key Observations:
1. **Pairs of Cards**: The maximum points you can score is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have. Each pair can potentially score you 1 point if Nene doesn't manage to score on it first.
2. **Nene's Optimal Play**: Since Nene plays optimally, she will always try to block you from scoring if possible. However, the problem states that you need to determine the maximum score you can achieve assuming Nene plays optimally. This means that you need to focus on the number of pairs you have, as this is the limiting factor in your score.
3. **Limiting Factor**: The maximum number of points you can score is limited by the number of pairs of cards you have (`pairs`) and the number of turns you get (`n // 2`). Since you take `n` turns, and each turn can potentially result in a point if there's a pair, the maximum points you can score is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and `n // 2`.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code defines two functions:
- `func_1(n, a)`: This function calculates the maximum number of points you can score. It counts the number of pairs in your hand (`pairs`) and returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`.
- `func_2()`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness of the Code:
The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by considering the number of pairs in your hand and the number of turns you have. The code correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results as required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
