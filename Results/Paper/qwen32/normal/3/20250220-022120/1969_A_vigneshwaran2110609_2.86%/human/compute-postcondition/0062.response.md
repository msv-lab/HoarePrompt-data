Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list `p` is distinct, ranges from 1 to `n`, and is not equal to its index `i`. The function returns a value for each test case based on these constraints.**
