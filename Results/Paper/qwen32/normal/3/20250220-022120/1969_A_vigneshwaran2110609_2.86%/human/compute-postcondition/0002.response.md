The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`], and all `p_i` are distinct; `x` is an input integer.**
