Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`], and all `p_i` are distinct.**

In this output state, `n` has been assigned the value of the input integer, while `t` and `p` retain their initial conditions.
