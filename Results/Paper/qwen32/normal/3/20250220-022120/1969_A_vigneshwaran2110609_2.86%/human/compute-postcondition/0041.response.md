The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`), and `n` is the total number of iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `n`.

Given that the loop has just completed an iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration would be `i_end + 1`. Since we don't have the exact value of `i_end`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` (assuming `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged**.

Since we don't have more specific information about the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration or any other variables that are not part of the loop head, we can only adjust `i` and confirm that `n` remains the same.

So the final state is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged**.
