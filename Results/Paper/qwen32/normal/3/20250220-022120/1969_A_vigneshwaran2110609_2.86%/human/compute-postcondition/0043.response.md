The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list of integers to the variable `l`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `x` retains its value as an input integer.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
