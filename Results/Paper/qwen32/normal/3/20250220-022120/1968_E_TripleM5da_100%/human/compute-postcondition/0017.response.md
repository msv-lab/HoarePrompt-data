To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `i` is 0.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The `range(3, n + 1)` indicates that `i` will start at 3 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`.

Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop has not started yet (or has just finished the previous run if it was a different loop).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the starting value of the range, which is 3. The value of `n` must remain at least 3 to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3**
