To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case. Here is the loop:

```python
for i in range(0, int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(1, 1)
    print(1, 2)
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        print(i, i)
```

This loop processes `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided by the user. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (with `2 <= n <= 10^3`), and then prints specific pairs of numbers:

1. It prints `(1, 1)`
2. It prints `(1, 2)`
3. It then prints `(i, i)` for each `i` from `3` to `n` (inclusive).

The loop variable `i` in the outer loop (`for i in range(0, int(input()))`) is used to iterate over the test cases, while the loop variable `i` in the inner loop (`for i in range(3, n + 1)`) is used to iterate over the numbers from `3` to `n`.

After all iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and the state of the variables will be as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
- `n` will be the value of `n` from the last test case processed.
- The loop variable `i` from the outer loop will be `t` (since it iterates from `0` to `t-1`).
- The loop variable `i` from the inner loop will be `n+1` from the last test case processed (since the inner loop iterates from `3` to `n`).

The output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, n is the integer value provided by the user input for the last test case, i is n + 1.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` remains the total number of test cases, `n` is the value of `n` for the last test case, and the loop variable `i` from the inner loop is `n + 1` from the last test case.
