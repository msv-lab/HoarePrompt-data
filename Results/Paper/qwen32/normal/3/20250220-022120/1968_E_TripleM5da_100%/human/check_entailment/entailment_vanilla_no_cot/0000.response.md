Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The program always starts with the points (1,1) and (1,2) and then places points (i,i) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This strategy does not guarantee the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when \(n = 3\), the program outputs the points (1,1), (1,2), and (3,3). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(\{0, 1, 4\}\), which has a size of 3. However, a better arrangement could be (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), a set of size 4.

Thus, the provided program does not always produce the optimal solution, making it incorrect for the given problem.
