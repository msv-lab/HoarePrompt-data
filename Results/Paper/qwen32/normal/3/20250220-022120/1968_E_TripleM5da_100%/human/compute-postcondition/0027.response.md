Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `i` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

From the initial state, we know the value of `i` is explicitly given as 0. The print statement will output the value of `i` twice.

So, the output will be:
Output: **0, 0**
