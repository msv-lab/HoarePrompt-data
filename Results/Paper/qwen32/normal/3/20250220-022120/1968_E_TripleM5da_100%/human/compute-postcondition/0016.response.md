Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- **Initial State**:
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
  - `n` must be at least 3.
  - `i` is explicitly set to 0.

- **Print Statement**:
  - `print(i, i)`

Given the initial state, we know the exact value of `i` which is 0. The print statement is straightforward and simply outputs the value of `i` twice.

**Explanation**:
- The value of `i` is 0.
- The print statement `print(i, i)` will therefore print the value of `i` twice.

**Output**:
Output: **0 0**
