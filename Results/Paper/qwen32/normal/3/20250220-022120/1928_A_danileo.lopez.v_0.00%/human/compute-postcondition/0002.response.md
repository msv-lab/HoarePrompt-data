The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and `a` and `b` are integers within the range 1 to 10^9. 

After executing the code, `a` and `b` will be updated to the values provided in the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**
