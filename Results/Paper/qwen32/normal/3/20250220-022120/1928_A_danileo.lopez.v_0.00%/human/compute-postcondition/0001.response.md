In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute `t` times. The only variable in the loop head is `t`, and the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times, and it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

The state before the loop starts includes `t`, `a`, and `b`. Since only the state of `t` can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9**
