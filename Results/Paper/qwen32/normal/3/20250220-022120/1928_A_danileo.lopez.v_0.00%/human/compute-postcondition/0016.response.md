The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement prints the string `'No'` directly. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are provided in the initial state, but they do not influence the output of this particular `print` statement because it is printing a static string.

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is mentioned to be greater than 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- The variables `a` and `b` are the first and second integers from the new input, respectively, but they are also not used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
