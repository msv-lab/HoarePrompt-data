### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob's goal is to cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The critical observation here is that for Bob to form a new rectangle, at least one of the resulting pieces must have integer dimensions.

- **Case 1: Both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd.**
  - If both dimensions are odd, then any cut parallel to either side will result in at least one dimension of the resulting rectangles being a fraction (specifically, half of an odd number), which is not an integer. Therefore, it is impossible to form a new rectangle with integer sides.

- **Case 2: At least one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even.**
  - If at least one dimension is even, then a cut parallel to the side with the even dimension will result in two rectangles with integer dimensions. These two rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle with integer sides.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either dimension is even, it prints "Yes", indicating that Bob can form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, it prints "No", indicating that Bob cannot form a new rectangle.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Annotations Analysis:
The annotations describe the program's state at key points and confirm that the program iterates through each test case, checks if either dimension is even, and prints the appropriate response.

```python
#State of the program right before the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t is 0, a and b are the last values provided as input, and the program has printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each of the t iterations based on whether at least one of a or b is even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` and prints 'Yes' if at least one of `a` or `b` is even, otherwise it prints 'No'.
```

The annotations correctly summarize the program's behavior, which aligns with the logic described in the problem analysis.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut. It checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even and prints "Yes" if so, otherwise "No". This matches the reasoning and the annotations provided.

### Final:
Final: **True**
