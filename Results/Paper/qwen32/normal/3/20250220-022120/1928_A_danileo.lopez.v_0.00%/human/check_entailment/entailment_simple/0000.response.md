### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size `a x b` can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The key insight is that if either `a` or `b` is even, the rectangle can always be cut in such a way that two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. This is because an even dimension allows for a cut that results in two smaller rectangles with integer sides that can be rearranged.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Cut Parallel to One Side:**
   - If `a` is even, cut the rectangle along its length to form two rectangles of size `a/2 x b`. These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `a x b/2`.
   - If `b` is even, cut the rectangle along its width to form two rectangles of size `a x b/2`. These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `a/2 x b`.

2. **Cut Parallel to the Other Side:**
   - If `a` is odd and `b` is even, cut the rectangle along its width to form two rectangles of size `a x b/2`. These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `a/2 x b`.
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, cut the rectangle along its length to form two rectangles of size `a/2 x b`. These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `a x b/2`.

3. **Both `a` and `b` are Odd:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only cuts possible result in smaller rectangles of size `a x 1` or `1 x b`, which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle (since the only possible rectangles formed would be `a x b` or `b x a`, which are considered the same).

Therefore, the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0` correctly determines if a different rectangle can be formed.

### Correctness:

The provided program correctly implements this logic and will output "Yes" if at least one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even, and "No" if both dimensions are odd.

**Correctness: True**
