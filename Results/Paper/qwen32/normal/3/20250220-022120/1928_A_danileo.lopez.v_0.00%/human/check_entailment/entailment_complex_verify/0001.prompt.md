You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t is 0, a and b are the last values provided as input, and the program has printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each of the t iterations based on whether at least one of a or b is even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` and prints 'Yes' if at least one of `a` or `b` is even, otherwise it prints 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting his original rectangle \(a \times b\), we need to consider the possible outcomes of the cuts.

1. **Cut Parallel to the Shorter Side:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to the shorter side, he will get two rectangles that each have one dimension equal to the shorter side and the other dimension equal to half of the longer side (if the longer side is even).

2. **Cut Parallel to the Longer Side:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to the longer side, he will get two rectangles that each have one dimension equal to the longer side and the other dimension equal to half of the shorter side (if the shorter side is even).

3. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - For Bob to form a new rectangle, at least one of the resulting rectangles must have integer dimensions after the cut, meaning the longer side must be divisible by 2 if the cut is parallel to the shorter side, or the shorter side must be divisible by 2 if the cut is parallel to the longer side.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then neither cut will result in two rectangles with integer dimensions that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

Given these observations, the condition in the program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either dimension is even, Bob can form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, he cannot.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described above. It checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even and prints "Yes" if so, otherwise "No".

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
