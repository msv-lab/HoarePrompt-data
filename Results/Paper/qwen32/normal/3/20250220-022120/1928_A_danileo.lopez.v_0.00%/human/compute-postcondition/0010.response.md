The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('Yes')`.
2. The string `'Yes'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output will be the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
