The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Yes'. The initial state provides some conditions about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of 'Yes' is not influenced by the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('Yes')`.
2. The string 'Yes' is directly provided as an argument to the `print` function.
3. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement.
4. Since the `print` statement does not depend on any variables, the output will always be 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
