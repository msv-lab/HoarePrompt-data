Output State: **t is 0, a and b are the last values provided as input, and the program has printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each of the t iterations based on whether at least one of a or b is even.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` implicitly with each iteration. The values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers provided as input. The program will have printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each of the `t` iterations, depending on whether at least one of `a` or `b` was even in each pair.
