The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use), and `t` which is the number of iterations. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, meaning there is at least one more iteration to go. Since `_` is not used in the loop body, it does not need to be adjusted.

At the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 because one iteration has just completed.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, and at least one of `a` or `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are odd integers**
