The code snippet appends two tuples to the `ops` list. The first tuple is `(v3, 0)` and the second tuple is `(v1, 0)`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are determined by the function `q` and are not altered by this code snippet. The set `vx` and the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `v2` are not affected by this code.

Given that `v2` is less than or equal to 0 and `v3` and `v1` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)` and `q(0)` respectively, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1` and `v3`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `p1` and `p2` retain their initial states, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)` and `q(0)` respectively, `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`**.
