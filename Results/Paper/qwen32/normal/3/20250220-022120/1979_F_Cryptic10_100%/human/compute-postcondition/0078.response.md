The code snippet initializes `vx` as a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (where `n` is the integer input by the user), and `ops` as an empty list. The initial state of `p1` and `p2` is not provided, but based on the description, they are dependent on the operations performed on `vx` and `ops` which have not yet occurred in this snippet.

Since `ops` is initialized as an empty list, no operations can be performed on it yet, and `p1` and `p2` remain unaffected by this initialization.

Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (where `n` is the integer input by the user); `ops` is an empty list; `p1` and `p2` retain their initial states.**
