Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive); `ops` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive) except `v1`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `vx` also excludes `v3`, and `ops` is a list containing `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(t - 2)`, and if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive) except `v1` and `v2` (if `v2` was originally in the set and not equal to `v1`). If `v2 > 0`, `ops` includes the new tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2 <= 0`, `v1` and `v3` are distinct, `vx` also excludes `v3` (if `v3` was originally in the set), `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`, and `ops` is updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive) with `v1` removed, `v2` removed if `v2` was originally in the set and not equal to `v1`, and `v3` removed if `v2 <= 0`; `vx` still has more than two elements; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before `v1` was removed; `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if `v2 <= 0`; `ops` is updated to include `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise `ops` is updated to include `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
