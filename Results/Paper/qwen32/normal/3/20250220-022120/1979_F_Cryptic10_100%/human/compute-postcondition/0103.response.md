The code snippet adds two tuples to the list `ops`. The first tuple is `(v3, 0)` and the second tuple is `(v1, 0)`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are derived from function calls to `q`, but their specific values are not given. The list `vx` has at least one element after removing `v1` and `v3`, and `v3` has already been removed from `vx`.

After the execution of the code snippet, the list `ops` will include the two new tuples. The other variables (`vx`, `v1`, `v2`, `v3`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and relationships, but their specific values are not altered by this code.

Output State: **`vx` has at least 1 element after removing `v1` and `v3`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) + 1 - 2)` before the removal; `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`; `ops` includes the additional tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.**
