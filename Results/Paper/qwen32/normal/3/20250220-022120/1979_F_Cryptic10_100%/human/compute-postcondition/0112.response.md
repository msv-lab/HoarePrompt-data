The given code snippet modifies one of the tuples in the list `ops` based on the condition provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- The code snippet uses a conditional expression to decide which tuple to modify.
- It checks if the last element of `p1` (which is a tuple from `ops`) is equal to `v2`.
- If the condition is true, it appends `v1` to `p2` (another tuple from `ops`).
- If the condition is false, it appends `v1` to `p1`.

Since `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list, we need to consider their values in the context of the operation. The operation modifies one of the tuples (`p1` or `p2`) by appending `v1` to it.

The output state will reflect the modified tuple. If `p1[-1] == v2` is true, `p2` will be modified. Otherwise, `p1` will be modified.

Let's assume `p1` and `p2` are specific tuples from the `ops` list. For the sake of this example, let's assume `p1` is `(a, b)` and `p2` is `(c, d)`.

- If `b == v2`, then `p2` becomes `(c, d, v1)`.
- If `b != v2`, then `p1` becomes `(a, b, v1)`.

Since the exact tuples `p1` and `p2` are not specified, we can't provide specific values, but we can describe the general output state.

Output State: **`ops` is a list of tuples, and one of the tuples in `ops` has been modified by appending `v1` to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If the condition is true, `p2` is modified; otherwise, `p1` is modified.**
