Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` (if `v2` was not greater than 0); `n` must be at least 5; `v1` is `v1_new` and `v2` is `v2_new`; `ops` includes the tuple `(v1_new, v2_new)` if `v2_new` is greater than 0, otherwise `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1_new, 0)`, and also includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`**.

Explanation: The `ops` list is extended to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. The values of `vx`, `n`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
