Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func()` does not take any input parameters. The input for the function is provided interactively through standard input, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in the graph. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function must interact with the interactor by making queries of the form "? d" (0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1) and receiving responses, and finally output the Hamiltonian path in the format "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n". The lambda function `q` is defined to take an integer `d`, print '? d', and return a map of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []
    while len(vx) > 2:
        v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
        vx.remove(v1)
        if v2 > 0:
            ops += [(v1, v2)]
        else:
            v3, _ = q(0)
            vx.remove(v3)
            ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]
    p1, p2 = list(vx), []
    for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
        (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
    print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers; `p1` is a list containing the initial integers plus all `v1` values from `ops`, with duplicates if `v1 != v2`; `p2` contains any `v1` values that were transferred from `p1` because `p1[-1] == v2`; `ops` is a list containing the original tuples.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - `p1` will contain the original elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from `ops` where the condition `p1[-1] != v2` was true.
- `p2` will contain all `v1` values from `ops` where the condition `p1[-1] == v2` was true.

Given the structure of the loop and the operations described, the final state can be described as follows:

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p1` contains elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2` at the time of processing, and `p2` contains elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2` at the time of processing.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
