Postcondition: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, `v2`, and potentially `v3` if `v2` was not greater than 0; `n` must be at least 5; `v1` is `v1_new` and `v2` is `v2_new`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1_new, v2_new)` and `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `vx` also excludes `v3`, `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)`, `(v1_new, 0)`, and `(v1, 0)`.**
