Postcondition: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive) except `v1`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `vx` also excludes `v3`, and `ops` is a list containing `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(t - 2)`, and if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`**.
