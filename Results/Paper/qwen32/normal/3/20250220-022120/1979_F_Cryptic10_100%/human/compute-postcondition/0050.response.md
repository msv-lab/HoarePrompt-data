Postcondition: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` where `n > 2`. `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(n - 4)`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` additionally excludes `v3` (which is the first value returned by `q(0)`), and `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`**.
