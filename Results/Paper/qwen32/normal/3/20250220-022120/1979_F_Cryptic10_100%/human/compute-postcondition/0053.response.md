The code snippet `vx.remove(v1)` removes the element `v1` from the set `vx`. Given the initial state, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, and `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 3)`. After the removal, `vx` will no longer contain `v1`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v2`, `n` must be at least 5, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 3)`**

In simpler terms, `vx` originally had all integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`. After removing `v1`, `vx` now excludes both `v1` and `v2`. The conditions on `n` and the definition of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged.
