Postcondition: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`, `vx` also excludes `v3`, and `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. In both cases, `p1` and `p2` retain their initial states, and `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)` and `q(0)` respectively.**
