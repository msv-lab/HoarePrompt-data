The code snippet `k = k - Min` updates the value of `k` by subtracting the value of `Min` from it. Given that `k` is initially `1` and `Min` is `-2`, the new value of `k` will be `1 - (-2)`, which equals `3`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is `-2`, `k` is `3`, `rep` is `2`, `tab` is a list containing two identical string representations of `number`, `Min` is `-2`, `Max` is `1`, `number` is `1`.**
