The value of `n` is decremented by the product of `Min` and `Max`. Given that both `Min` and `Max` are 1, `n` is decremented by 1. Therefore, `n` changes from 1 to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is 0, `rep` is 2, `tab` is `['5', '5', '1']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 1, `k` is 0, `number` is 1.**
