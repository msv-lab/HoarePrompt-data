The code snippet assigns the value of `Max` to the variable `number`. Given that `Max` is `1`, `number` will be updated to `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is `-2`, `k` is `1`, `rep` is `2`, `tab` is a list containing two identical string representations of `number`, `Min` is `-2`, `Max` is `1`, `number` is `1`.**
