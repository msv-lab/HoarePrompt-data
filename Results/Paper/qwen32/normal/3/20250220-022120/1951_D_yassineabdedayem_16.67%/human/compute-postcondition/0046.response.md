The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is assigned from the list `tab` in each iteration. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the list `tab` to process.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last processed element from `tab`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `tab` after the last processed element. Since `rep` is the number of iterations the loop has executed plus one, it indicates the current iteration number. Therefore, `i` should be the element at index `rep - 1` in `tab`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of iterations the loop executed + 1, `tab` is a list containing at least `rep` string representations of a number, `i` is the element at index `rep - 1` in `tab`**
