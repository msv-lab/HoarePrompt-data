The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial values of `n` and `k` are not relevant because they are being overwritten by the input values. The other variables (`t`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `k` is 0, `tab` contains two elements: `['5', '6']`.
- Otherwise, `k` is not 0 and `tab` contains one element: `['5']`.

After executing the code, `n` and `k` will have the values read from the input. The value of `tab` will depend on the new value of `k`:
- If the new `k` is 0, `tab` will be `['5', '6']`.
- If the new `k` is not 0, `tab` will be `['5']`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `rep` is 1, `tab` is either `['5']` or `['5', '6']` depending on the new value of `k`, and `number` is 5.**
