To determine the new values of `Min` and `Max` after the code execution, we need to evaluate the expressions `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` based on the initial conditions provided.

Given:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `Min` is initially 2
- `Max` is initially 5

The new values for `Min` and `Max` will be:
- `Min` will be the minimum value between `n // k` and `k`
- `Max` will be the maximum value between `int(n / k)` and `k`

Since `n // k` and `int(n / k)` are essentially the same (both represent integer division), the expressions simplify to finding the minimum and maximum between `n // k` and `k`.

Given the constraints:
- If `n // k` is less than `k`, then `Min` will be `n // k` and `Max` will be `k`.
- If `n // k` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `Min` will be `k` and `Max` will be `n // k`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we can't determine specific numeric values for `Min` and `Max`, but we can express the possible outcomes based on the conditions.

Therefore, the Output State can be described as:
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`
- `Max` is the maximum of `n // k` and `k`

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing either ['2'] or ['5'], `number` is either 2 or 5, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `n // k` and `k`**.
