The value of `number` is updated to the value of `Max`. Since `Max` is initially equal to `k`, after the execution, `number` will also be equal to `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `rep` is 0, `number` is `k`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `k`. Either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**
