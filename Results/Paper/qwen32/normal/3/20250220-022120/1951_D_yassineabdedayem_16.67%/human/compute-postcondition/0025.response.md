The code snippet `tab.append(str(number))` appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `number` is either 1 or `k + Min`. Since `Min` is 1, `number` is either 1 or `k + 1`. The list `tab` initially contains the string representation of `number`, so after appending `str(number)` to `tab`, `tab` will contain two identical string representations of `number`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is either 0 or `k - Min`, `k` is either 0 or `k - Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing two identical string representations of `number`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is either 0 or `k + Min`, and `number` is either 1 or `k + Min`.**
