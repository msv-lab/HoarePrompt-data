Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `k` is 0
- `t` is 1
- `n` is 0
- `rep` is 2
- `tab` is `['5', '5']`
- `number` is 5

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a `print` statement that attempts to print the variable `i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, attempting to print `i` would result in a `NameError` because `i` is not recognized in the current scope.

### Conclusion:
Since the variable `i` is not defined, the code will not execute successfully as it stands. The task requires us to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information. Given that `i` is not defined, the code cannot be executed without causing an error.

### Output:
Since the code contains a reference to an undefined variable, it will raise an error. However, the task asks for the output of the `print` statement assuming the code were to execute. Given that `i` is undefined, we cannot provide a specific value to print.

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined** (if the code were executed as-is)

However, following the task's instruction strictly for the print statement:
Output: **i (where i is not defined in the provided initial state)**
