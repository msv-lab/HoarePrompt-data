The code snippet `tab = []` sets the variable `tab` to an empty list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `number`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `rep` is 0, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is 0.**
