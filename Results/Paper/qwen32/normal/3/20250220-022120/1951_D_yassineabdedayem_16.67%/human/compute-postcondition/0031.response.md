The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `Max` from it. Given that `k` is initially `1` and `Max` is `1`, the new value of `k` will be `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is `-2`, `k` is `0`, `rep` is `2`, `tab` is a list containing two identical string representations of `number`, `Min` is `-2`, `Max` is `1`, `number` is `-2`.**
