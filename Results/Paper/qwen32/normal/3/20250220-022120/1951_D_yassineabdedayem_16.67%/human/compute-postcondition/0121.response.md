The code snippet updates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the given formula. Here's the calculation:

- `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`. Given `n` is 5 and `k` is 1, `n // k` is `5 // 1` which equals 5. Therefore, `Min` becomes `min(5, 1)` which is 1.
- `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`. Given `n` is 5 and `k` is 1, `int(n / k)` is `int(5 / 1)` which equals 5. Therefore, `Max` becomes `max(5, 1)` which is 5.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `number`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is 5, `k` is 1, `rep` is 1, `tab` is `['5']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 5, `number` is 5**.
