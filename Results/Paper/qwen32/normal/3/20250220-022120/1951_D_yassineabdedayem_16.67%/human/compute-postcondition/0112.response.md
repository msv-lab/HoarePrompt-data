The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`. Given the initial state, `k` is 5 and `Max` is also 5, so `k` becomes `5 - 5`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is 10, `k` is 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is 2, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5, `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Note: The condition `Max` equals `k` is no longer valid since `k` is now 0 and `Max` is 5. However, the initial condition `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k` is also no longer valid since `n * Min` is `10 * 2` which is 20, and `k` is now 0. The output state reflects the updated value of `k` and the other conditions are no longer satisfied as per the new value of `k`.
