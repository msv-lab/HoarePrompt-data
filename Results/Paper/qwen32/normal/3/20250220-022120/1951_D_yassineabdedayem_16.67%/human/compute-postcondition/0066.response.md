The code snippet `tab.append(str(number))` appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. Given the initial state, `number` is either 2 or 5, so `tab` will contain either '2' or '5' as a string.

The values of other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code, which they are not in this case.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is 10, `k` is either 0 or 3, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing either ['2'] or ['5'], `number` is either 2 or 5, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 2. Otherwise, `k` is 3 and `number` is 5.**
