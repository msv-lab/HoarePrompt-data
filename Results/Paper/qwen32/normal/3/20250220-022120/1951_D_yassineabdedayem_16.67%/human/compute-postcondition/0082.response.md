The value of `k` is decremented by `Max`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Max`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing either `['2', str(number)]` or `['5', str(number)]`, `number` is `Min`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Max`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing either `['2', str(number)]` or `['5', str(number)]`, `number` is `Min`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.
