Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `rep` is the number of iterations the loop executed (<= 60), and `tab` is a list containing `rep` string representations of the values of numbers calculated in each iteration. If `k` is 0, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.**
