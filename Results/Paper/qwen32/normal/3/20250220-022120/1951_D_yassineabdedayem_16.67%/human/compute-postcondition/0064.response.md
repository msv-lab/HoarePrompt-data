The code snippet `k = k - Min` subtracts the value of `Min` from `k`. Given the initial state, `k` is 5 and `Min` is 2. After executing the code, `k` becomes `5 - 2`, which is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is 10, `k` is 3, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is 5, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**.
