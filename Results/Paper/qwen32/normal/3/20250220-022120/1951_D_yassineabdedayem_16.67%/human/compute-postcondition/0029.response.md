The given code snippet updates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the current values of `n` and `k`. Here's the impact of the code:

- `n` is `-2` and `k` is `1`.
- `Min` is reassigned to the minimum value between `n // k` and `k`. Since `n // k` is `-2 // 1` which equals `-2`, and `k` is `1`, `Min` becomes `-2`.
- `Max` is reassigned to the maximum value between `int(n / k)` and `k`. Since `int(n / k)` is `int(-2 / 1)` which equals `-2`, and `k` is `1`, `Max` becomes `1`.

The other variables (`t`, `rep`, `tab`, `number`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is `-2`, `k` is `1`, `rep` is `2`, `tab` is a list containing two identical string representations of `number`, `Min` is `-2`, `Max` is `1`, `number` is either `1` or `k + Min`**.
