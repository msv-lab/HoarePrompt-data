The code snippet provided initializes a variable `rep` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`, which remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, `rep` is 0.**
