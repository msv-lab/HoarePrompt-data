Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is 10, `k` is 5, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is 5, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**

In this output state, the value of `number` has been updated to 5, which is the value of `Max`. All other variables retain their initial values and the precondition remains valid.
