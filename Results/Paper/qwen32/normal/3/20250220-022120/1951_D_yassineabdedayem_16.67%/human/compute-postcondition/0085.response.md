Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on whether `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing either `['2', str(number)]` or `['5', str(number)]`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is `k - Max` and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - Min` and `number` is `Max`.**
