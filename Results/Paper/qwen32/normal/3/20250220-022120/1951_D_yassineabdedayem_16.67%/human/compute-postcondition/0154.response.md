To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the provided loop and the given states after the first three iterations.

Here's a summary of the loop's behavior based on the provided output states:

1. **First Iteration**: `n` becomes 0, and `k` can either remain non-zero or become zero. `tab` contains up to one string representation of a number.
2. **Second Iteration**: `n` becomes 0 again, and `k` can either remain non-zero or become zero. `tab` contains up to two string representations of numbers, with the last number being 5.
3. **Third Iteration**: `n` becomes 0 once more, and `k` can either remain non-zero or become zero. `tab` contains exactly two string representations of the number 5.

Given this pattern, it seems that `n` is set to 0 after each iteration, and `k` can either be reduced to 0 or remain non-zero. The `tab` list accumulates string representations of numbers calculated in each iteration.

Since the loop runs `t` times, and the provided output states show that `n` is reset to 0 after each iteration, we can infer that after all `t` iterations, `n` will still be 0.

The `tab` list will contain a series of string representations of numbers calculated in each iteration. The exact contents of `tab` depend on the specific values of `n` and `k` provided in each iteration, but it will have accumulated `t` string representations of numbers.

The variable `k` will either be 0 if it was reduced to 0 in any of the iterations, or it will be non-zero if it was never reduced to 0.

Given the initial state and the pattern observed, the final output state after all iterations can be described as follows:

- `t` will be 0 (since the loop runs `t` times and `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration).
- `n` will be 0 (as `n` is set to 0 after each iteration).
- `k` will be either 0 or a non-negative integer (depending on whether `k` was reduced to 0 in any of the iterations).
- `tab` will contain `t` string representations of numbers calculated in each iteration.
- `rep` will be the number of iterations the inner loop executed in the last iteration of the outer loop (<= 60).
- `number` will be the last number calculated in the last iteration of the outer loop.

However, since the problem asks for the output state after all the executions of the loop, we focus on the final output printed by the program, which is based on the state of `k` and `tab` after all iterations.

If `k` is 0 after all iterations, the program will print "YES", the length of `tab`, and the elements of `tab`. If `k` is not 0, the program will print "NO".

Given the pattern and the fact that `n` is reset to 0 after each iteration, we can infer that the final output state will be based on the final value of `k` after all `t` iterations.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` for each iteration are not provided, we cannot determine the exact contents of `tab`. However, we can describe the final output state in terms of the possible outcomes.

Output State: **If `k` is 0 after all iterations, the output will be "YES", followed by the length of `tab` and the elements of `tab`. If `k` is not 0, the output will be "NO".**

In simpler terms, the final output state is determined by whether `k` was reduced to 0 in any of the iterations. If it was, the program prints "YES" followed by the sequence of numbers calculated. If not, it prints "NO".
