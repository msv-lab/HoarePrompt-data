Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is 1, `rep` is 2, `tab` is `['5', '5']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 1, `k` is 1, `number` is 5**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the given formula. Since `n` is 1 and `k` is 1:

- `Min` is calculated as `min(n // k, k)`, which is `min(1 // 1, 1)` resulting in `Min` being 1.
- `Max` is calculated as `max(int(n / k), k)`, which is `max(int(1 / 1), 1)` resulting in `Max` being 1.

All other variables remain unchanged.
