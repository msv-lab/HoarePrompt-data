To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the provided solution correctly finds an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

The given program always selects \( y = x // 2 \) for each test case. However, this approach does not necessarily yield the maximum value for \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Let's consider a few examples to illustrate this:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: \( x = 10 \)
   - The program selects \( y = 10 // 2 = 5 \).
   - \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).
   - However, for \( y = 9 \), \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
   - Both \( y = 5 \) and \( y = 9 \) yield the same maximum value, so the program's output is correct for this case.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: \( x = 7 \)
   - The program selects \( y = 7 // 2 = 3 \).
   - \(\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\).
   - However, for \( y = 6 \), \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\).
   - The program's output is incorrect because \( y = 6 \) yields a higher value.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: \( x = 21 \)
   - The program selects \( y = 21 // 2 = 10 \).
   - \(\gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11\).
   - However, for \( y = 18 \), \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21\).
   - The program's output is incorrect because \( y = 18 \) yields a higher value.

Based on these examples, we can see that the program does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **False**
