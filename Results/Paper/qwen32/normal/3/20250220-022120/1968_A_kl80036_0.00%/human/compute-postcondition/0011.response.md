Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `i` is 2.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2.

The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y`. Since `y` is defined as the integer division of `x` by 2, the output will be the integer part of `x` divided by 2.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `x` is not explicitly provided, so we will refer to it as `x`.
2. `y` is calculated as `x // 2`, which means `y` is the result of integer division of `x` by 2.

Therefore, the output will be the integer division of the input integer `x` by 2.

Output: **y (where y is the integer division of x by 2)**
