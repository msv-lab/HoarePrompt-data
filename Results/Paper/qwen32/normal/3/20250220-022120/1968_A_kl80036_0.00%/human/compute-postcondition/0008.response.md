Let's analyze the given task step by step.

The loop in question is:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop head, we can see that the only variable being adjusted in each iteration is `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the integer value provided by the input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is `x // 2`

We need to adjust the state for the start of the next iteration. Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that gets updated, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

There is no need to adjust `x` or `y` because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop iterations.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration and gets incremented by 1)
- `x` remains the same
- `y` remains the same

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**
