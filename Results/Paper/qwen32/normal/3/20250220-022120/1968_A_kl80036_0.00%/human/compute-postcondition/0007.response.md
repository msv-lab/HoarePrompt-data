To determine the output, let's break down the given information and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is calculated as `x // 2`, which is the integer division of `x` by 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   - The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y`.

Since `y` is calculated as `x // 2`, the output will depend on the value of `x`. However, we don't have a specific value for `x` provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can describe the output in terms of `x`.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
- The value of `y` is determined by the integer division of `x` by 2.
- Integer division (`//`) means that the result is the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.

**Output Description:**
- If `x` is an even number, `y` will be exactly half of `x`.
- If `x` is an odd number, `y` will be the integer part of half of `x`, effectively discarding the remainder.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `y`. However, we can describe `y` as `x // 2`.

Output: **y (where y is the integer division of x by 2)**
