You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and prints the result of integer division of `x` by 2.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always find the integer \( y \) (1 \(\le\) \( y \) < \( x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximum possible. The program simply selects \( y = x // 2 \), which does not guarantee the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Let's consider a few test cases to demonstrate this:

1. For \( x = 10 \):
   - The program outputs \( y = 5 \).
   - \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).
   - However, \( y = 9 \) gives \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\), which is also correct, but \( y = 6 \) gives \(\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8\), which is less than 10.
   - While \( y = 5 \) is a valid solution, it is not guaranteed to be the optimal one for all cases.

2. For \( x = 7 \):
   - The program outputs \( y = 3 \).
   - \(\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\).
   - However, \( y = 6 \) gives \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\), which is better.

3. For \( x = 21 \):
   - The program outputs \( y = 10 \).
   - \(\gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11\).
   - However, \( y = 18 \) gives \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21\), which is better.

In these examples, the program does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
