You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: i is t-1, x is the last input integer, y is the integer division of the last input integer by 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. Here, \( \gcd(x, y) \) denotes the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

### Key Observations

1. The value of \( y \) should be chosen such that both \( y \) and \( \gcd(x, y) \) are maximized.
2. The largest possible value for \( y \) is \( x - 1 \), but this doesn't always yield the maximum \( \gcd(x, y) \).
3. A common strategy is to choose \( y = x // 2 \) because it often provides a good balance between \( y \) and \( \gcd(x, y) \). This is because \( \gcd(x, x // 2) \) is usually larger than for other values of \( y \), especially when \( x \) is even.

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows this strategy by setting \( y = x // 2 \) for each test case and printing it. Let's verify if this approach works for the given examples.

#### Example Verification

- For \( x = 10 \):
  - \( y = 10 // 2 = 5 \)
  - \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \)
  - This is indeed a valid solution.

- For \( x = 7 \):
  - \( y = 7 // 2 = 3 \)
  - \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \)
  - This is valid, but not necessarily optimal. The optimal solution would be \( y = 6 \) because \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \).

- For \( x = 21 \):
  - \( y = 21 // 2 = 10 \)
  - \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11 \)
  - This is valid, but not optimal. The optimal solution would be \( y = 18 \) because \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21 \).

- For \( x = 100 \):
  - \( y = 100 // 2 = 50 \)
  - \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 \)
  - This is indeed a valid solution.

- For \( x = 2 \):
  - \( y = 2 // 2 = 1 \)
  - \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
  - This is valid.

- For \( x = 1000 \):
  - \( y = 1000 // 2 = 500 \)
  - \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000 \)
  - This is indeed a valid solution.

- For \( x = 6 \):
  - \( y = 6 // 2 = 3 \)
  - \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \)
  - This is indeed a valid solution.

### Conclusion

While the provided program does not always yield the optimal \( y \) (e.g., for \( x = 7 \), the optimal \( y \) is 6, not 3), it does provide a valid \( y \) for each test case. The problem statement allows for any valid \( y \) to be printed, so the program is correct based on the given requirements.
