The code snippet `x = int(input())` will prompt for a new input and assign this input to `x`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `y` is still defined as `x // 2` from the initial state. However, since `x` is reassigned, `y` will not reflect the new value of `x` until it is recalculated. Given that `y` is not recalculated in the provided code, it will retain its initial value based on the old `x`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is the integer division of the old `x` by 2**.
