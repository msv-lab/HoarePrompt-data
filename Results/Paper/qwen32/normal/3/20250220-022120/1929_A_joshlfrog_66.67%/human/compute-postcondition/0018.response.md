The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `l` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 2. The values of `t`, `l`, `nums`, `x`, and `y` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is greater than or equal to 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; if `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`; otherwise, `y` remains 100000000. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`; otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.**
