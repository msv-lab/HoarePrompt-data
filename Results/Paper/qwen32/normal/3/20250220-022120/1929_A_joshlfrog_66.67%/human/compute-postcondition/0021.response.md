The code snippet `y = nums[i]` updates the value of `y` to be the value of `nums[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `y` is updated to `nums[2]`. The conditions regarding the comparison of `nums[i]` with `y` and `x` are not evaluated or changed in this snippet, so those conditions remain as they were described.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is greater than or equal to 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `y` is `nums[2]`; if `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`; otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.**
