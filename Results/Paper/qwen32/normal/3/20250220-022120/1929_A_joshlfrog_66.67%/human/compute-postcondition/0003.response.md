The code reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring into an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The values of `t` and `l` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500; `l` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
