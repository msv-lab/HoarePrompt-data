The code snippet provided updates the list `nums` by reading a new set of integers from the user input. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `e`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `l` is the integer value provided by the user input, `nums` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in `nums`, and `e` is `e + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the list `nums` is updated with new values from user input, while the other variables remain unchanged.
