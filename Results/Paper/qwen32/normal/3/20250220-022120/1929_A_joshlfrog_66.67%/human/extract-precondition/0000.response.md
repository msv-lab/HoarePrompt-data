Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**
