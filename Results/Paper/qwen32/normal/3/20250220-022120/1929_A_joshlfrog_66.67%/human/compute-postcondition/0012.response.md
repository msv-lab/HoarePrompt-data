Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is greater than or equal to 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; if `nums[i]` is less than `y` (which is initially 100000000), then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000. If the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `x` (which is initially 0), then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0.**
