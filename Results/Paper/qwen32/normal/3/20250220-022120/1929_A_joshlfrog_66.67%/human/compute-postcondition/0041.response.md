Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `e` is `e + 1`, `x` is `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than the previous `x`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged, `y` is `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than the previous `y`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, and `i` is `i + 1`. Specifically, if `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`.**
