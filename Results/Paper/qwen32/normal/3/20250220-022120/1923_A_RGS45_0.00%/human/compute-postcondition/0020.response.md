The code snippet `z = arr[x:n - y]` slices the string `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be equal to the previous `t` minus 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a string input by the user.
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.

After executing `z = arr[x:n - y]`, the variable `z` will hold the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to, but not including, index `n - y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be equal to the previous `t` minus 1; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a string input by the user; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**
