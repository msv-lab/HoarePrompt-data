### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the configuration of the ribbon as a string `arr`.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - The program uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip in the ribbon.
   - The program uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip in the ribbon. However, this index is relative to the reversed string, so it needs to be adjusted to the original string by subtracting it from `n - 1`.

3. **Counting Free Cells Between Chips:**
   - The program slices the string `arr` from the first chip index `x` to the last chip index `n - y - 1` (correcting for the reversed index).
   - It then counts the number of '0's in this substring, which represents the free cells between the first and last chip.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Last Chip Index:**
  - The index `y` is found in the reversed string, so it should be adjusted to the original string by using `n - y - 1` instead of `n - y`.
- **Incorrect Substring Slicing:**
  - The substring `z` should be sliced from `x` to `n - y - 1` to include all cells between the first and last chip.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        # Correct the index of the last chip in the original string
        last_chip_index = n - y - 1
        
        # Slice the substring between the first and last chip
        z = arr[x:last_chip_index + 1]
        
        # Count the number of '0's in the substring
        print(z.count('0'))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the last chip's index and the incorrect slicing of the substring. The corrected version of the program should address these issues.

**Correctness: False**
