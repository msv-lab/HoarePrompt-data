Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of cells and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is either 0 (indicating the cell is free) or 1 (indicating the cell contains a chip). The function processes each test case and returns the number of chips in the cells for each test case.**
