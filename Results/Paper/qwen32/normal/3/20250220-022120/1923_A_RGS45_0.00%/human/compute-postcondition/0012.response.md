The code snippet updates the value of `y` to be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`. If '1' is not found, `y` will be -1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is the new input string; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**
