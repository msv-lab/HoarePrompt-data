The given code snippet reverses the string `arr` and then finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in this reversed string. Let's determine the new state of the variables after this operation.

- `t` remains the same, as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- `n` remains the same, as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- `arr` remains the same, as the code snippet creates a reversed copy of `arr` without modifying the original `arr`.
- `x` remains the same, as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- `y` is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`. This value will be the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the original string `arr` (if '1' is present), or -1 if '1' is not found.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be equal to the previous `t` minus 1; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a string input by the user; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.**
