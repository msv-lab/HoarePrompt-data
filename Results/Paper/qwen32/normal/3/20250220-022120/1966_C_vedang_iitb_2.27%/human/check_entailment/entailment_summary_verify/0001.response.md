### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem, the provided program, and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing stones from piles. The key to solving this problem is understanding the game's mechanics and how to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the piles. Specifically, the game can be analyzed using the concept of the Nim game, where the winner is determined by the XOR (exclusive OR) of the pile sizes. If the XOR of all pile sizes is non-zero, Alice (the first player) has a winning strategy; otherwise, Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy.

#### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

##### Function `func_1`

This function processes the list of pile sizes by first removing duplicates and then sorting. It then calculates the differences between consecutive sorted unique pile sizes. However, this transformation does not directly help in determining the winner based on the game rules. It seems to be an unnecessary step and does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

##### Function `func_2`

This function attempts to determine the winner recursively. It handles special cases for 1 and 2 piles separately. For more than 2 piles, it recursively determines the winner for the remaining piles and then uses this information to decide the winner for the current configuration.

However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed:

1. **Base Cases**: The base cases for 1 and 2 piles seem to be incorrect or incomplete.
   - For `n == 1`, the function returns 1, indicating Alice wins, which is incorrect. If there's only one pile, Alice can only take all the stones if the pile size is greater than 1, otherwise, she loses.
   - For `n == 2`, the function checks if the pile sizes are equal. If they are, it returns 1 (Alice wins), otherwise, it returns 2 (Bob wins). This is also incorrect. The correct approach for two piles is to check if the XOR of the two pile sizes is non-zero.

2. **Recursive Case**: The recursive case does not correctly handle the game mechanics. It doesn't consider the optimal moves based on the game rules.

#### Correct Solution Approach

The correct approach to solve this problem involves the concept of the Nim game, specifically the Grundy number (or Nim-sum) for each pile size. The Grundy number for a pile of size `x` is `x` itself. The overall game state can be determined by the XOR of the Grundy numbers of all piles. If the XOR result is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy; otherwise, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.

#### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the winner based on the game rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
