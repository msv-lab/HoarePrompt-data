To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the behavior of the two functions `func_1` and `func_2` and ensure that they collectively solve the problem as described.

### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `a` (representing the number of stones in each pile) and performs the following steps:
1. It creates a sorted list of unique integers from `a`.
2. It then modifies this list such that each element (except the first) is the difference between the current and the previous unique, sorted numbers from `a`.

**Output Hints**: 
- The output is a list where the first element is the smallest unique number, and subsequent elements are the differences between consecutive unique numbers.

However, the transformation performed by `func_1` does not seem to directly contribute to solving the problem of determining the winner of the game. The transformation does not capture any game state or provide useful information for `func_2` to determine the winner. It seems to be an unnecessary transformation that could be misleading.

### Function `func_2` Analysis:
The function `func_2` is supposed to determine the winner based on the transformed list `a` and the number of piles `n`. Here is a breakdown of its logic:
1. If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins (`return 1`).
2. If there are two piles (`n == 2`), Alice wins if the number of stones in the first pile is even (`return 1`), otherwise Bob wins (`return 2`).
3. For more than two piles (`n > 2`), it recursively determines the winner for the remaining piles (`a[1:]`). It then uses this result to decide the winner:
   - If the winner of the remaining piles is Bob (`winNext == 2`), Alice wins.
   - If the winner of the remaining piles is Alice (`winNext == 1`) and the number of stones in the first pile is not 1, Alice wins.
   - Otherwise, Bob wins.

**Output Hints**:
- The function returns `1` if Alice wins and `2` if Bob wins.

### Problem Solving Approach:
The problem can be solved using the concept of the Nim game or Grundy numbers. The key observation is that the game described is equivalent to the Nim game where the piles are reduced by the smallest pile in each move. The game state can be analyzed using the XOR of the pile sizes. If the XOR of all pile sizes is zero, the position is losing for the player to move (Bob wins). Otherwise, it is winning for the player to move (Alice wins).

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the XOR of pile sizes. The transformation in `func_1` is not necessary and does not contribute to solving the problem. The logic in `func_2` is incorrect for determining the winner based on the problem's rules.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
