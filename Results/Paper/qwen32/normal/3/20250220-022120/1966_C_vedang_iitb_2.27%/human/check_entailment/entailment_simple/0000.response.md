### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the provided rules. Let's analyze the functions `func_1` and `func_2` to see if they correctly implement the logic for determining the winner.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Transform the list of piles into a form that can be used to determine the winner.
- **Transformation**:
  - `a_new` is created as a sorted list of unique elements from `a`.
  - Each subsequent element in `a_new` (except the first) is replaced by the difference between itself and the previous element in the sorted unique list.
- **State After Transformation**: `a_new` contains the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes, sorted in ascending order.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Determine the winner based on the transformed list `a`.
- **Logic**:
  - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can take all stones.
  - If there are two piles (`n == 2`):
    - If the smaller pile has an even number of stones, Alice wins because she can always mirror Bob's moves.
    - Otherwise, Bob wins.
  - For more than two piles (`n > 2`):
    - Recursively determine the winner for the list excluding the smallest pile.
    - If the next player to move would lose (`winNext == 2`), or the current player can force a win by not leaving the smallest pile with exactly one stone (`winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1`), the current player wins.
    - Otherwise, the current player loses.

### Analysis:
The transformation in `func_1` and the logic in `func_2` do not directly align with the game's rules. The transformation does not provide a clear and correct way to determine the winner based on the game's mechanics. Specifically:

- The transformation in `func_1` does not provide a meaningful representation of the game state for determining the winner.
- The logic in `func_2` does not correctly handle the game's rules, especially for more than two piles. The recursive approach does not consider the strategic nature of the game correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the game's rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
