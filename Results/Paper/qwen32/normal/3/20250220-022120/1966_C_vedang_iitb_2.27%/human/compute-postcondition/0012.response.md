Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, `n` is an integer representing the number of piles such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`, and `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is not equal to 2; `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. Additionally, `winNext` is not equal to 2, and if `winNext` is equal to 1, then the first element of `a` is 1.**
