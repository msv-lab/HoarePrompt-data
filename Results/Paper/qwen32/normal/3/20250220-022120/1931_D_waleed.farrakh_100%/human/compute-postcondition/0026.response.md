The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more value in the `results` list that can be assigned to `result`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` must be at least 1
- `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple `[(n, x, y, arr)]`
- `results` must contain at least one more value
- `result` is the next value from `results`

Since `result` is the next value from `results`, and the loop is about to start the next iteration, `results` must have at least one more value for the loop to continue. The variable `result` will be assigned the next value from `results`.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple `[(n, x, y, arr)]`, `results` must contain at least two more values, `result` is the next value from `results`**
