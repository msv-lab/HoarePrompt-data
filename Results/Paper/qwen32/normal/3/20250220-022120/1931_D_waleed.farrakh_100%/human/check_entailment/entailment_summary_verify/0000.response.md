Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
Polycarp considers a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (1 \(\le\) i < j \(\le\) n) beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The task is to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array \(a\).

### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(test_cases)`: This function takes a list of test cases and processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls `func_1` to get results, which it then prints.

#### Core Logic in `func_1`:
- For each test case, it initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs of remainders.
- It iterates through each element `a` in the array `arr`.
- For each element, it calculates:
  - `rx`: The remainder of \(-a\) when divided by \(x\), adjusted to be non-negative.
  - `ry`: The remainder of \(a\) when divided by \(y\).
- It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the count of that pair to the `count` variable.
- It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair of remainders `(a % x, a % y)`.

### Correctness Verification:
The logic in `func_1` is based on the idea that for a pair \((a_i, a_j)\) to be beautiful:
- \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
- \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

The code correctly calculates the necessary remainders and uses a frequency dictionary to count potential pairs efficiently. The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative, which is crucial for correct dictionary indexing.

### Testing with Example Cases:
Let's test the code with the provided example cases to ensure it works correctly.

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
```
Output:
```
2
```
Explanation:
- Pairs: \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\) and \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\) are beautiful.

#### Example 2:
Input:
```
7 9 5
1 10 15 3 8 12 15
```
Output:
```
0
```
Explanation:
- No pairs satisfy both conditions.

#### Example 3:
Input:
```
9 4 10
14 10 2 2 11 11 13 5 6
```
Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
- Pair: \(\langle 2, 5 \rangle\) is beautiful.

### Detailed Reasoning:
The core logic in `func_1` is correct. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is non-negative.
   - `ry = a % y` calculates the remainder of `a` when divided by `y`.
2. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The dictionary `freq` keeps track of the number of times each pair `(a % x, a % y)` has been seen.
3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - For each element `a` in the array, the code checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, it means there are previous elements that can form a beautiful pair with the current element `a`.
   - The count of such pairs is added to the `count` variable.
4. **Updating Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The current pair `(a % x, a % y)` is added to the `freq` dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs according to the problem description. It handles the constraints and edge cases effectively. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**.
