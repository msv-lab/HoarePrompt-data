Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 1**

In simple terms, the variable `test_cases` now contains one tuple with the values `(n, x, y, arr)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
