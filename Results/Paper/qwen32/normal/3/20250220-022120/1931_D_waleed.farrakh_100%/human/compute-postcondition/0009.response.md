The code increments the variable `idx` by 2. Therefore, the new value of `idx` is the previous value plus 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3**.
