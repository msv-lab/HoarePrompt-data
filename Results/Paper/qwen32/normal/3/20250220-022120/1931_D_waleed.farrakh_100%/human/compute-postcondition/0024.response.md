The only variable in the loop head is `result`, which iterates over the `results` list. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to understand that `result` will take the next value from the `results` list.

Given:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple `[(n, x, y, arr)]`.

However, the `results` list is not mentioned to be related to `t` or `test_cases` directly in the provided information. We can only adjust the state of `result` for the next iteration.

Since `result` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to assume that `results` is a list that contains some values, and `result` will take the next value from this list.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `result` is the last value from the `results` list processed in the previous iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more value that `result` can take.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple `[(n, x, y, arr)]`, `results` must contain at least one more value, `result` is the next value from `results`.**
