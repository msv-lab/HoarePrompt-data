### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summaries to ensure correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap
We need to find pairs \((i, j)\) in an array \(a\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it extracts \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(arr\).
   - It correctly stores these in a list of tuples and passes them to `func_1`.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs (`func_1`)**:
   - The function initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of pairs \((a \% x, a \% y)\).
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`. This is a correct way to compute the non-negative remainder of \(-a\) modulo \(x\).
     - It calculates `ry` as `a % y`.
     - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to `count` because each occurrence of `(rx, ry)` can form a beautiful pair with the current element `a`.
     - It then updates the frequency of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Modular Arithmetic and Pair Conditions**:
   - To satisfy the first condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\), we need \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\). This is correctly handled by calculating `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`.
   - To satisfy the second condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\), we need \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\). This is correctly handled by calculating `ry` as `a % y`.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - Let's verify the example provided in the problem description.
   - For the first test case with \(a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]\), \(x = 5\), and \(y = 2\):
     - For \(a_1 = 1\), `rx = 4` and `ry = 1`. No pairs in `freq`, so `count` remains 0. Update `freq` with `(1, 1)`.
     - For \(a_2 = 2\), `rx = 3` and `ry = 0`. No pairs in `freq`, so `count` remains 0. Update `freq` with `(2, 0)`.
     - For \(a_3 = 7\), `rx = 3` and `ry = 1`. No pairs in `freq`, so `count` remains 0. Update `freq` with `(2, 1)`.
     - For \(a_4 = 4\), `rx = 1` and `ry = 0`. No pairs in `freq`, so `count` remains 0. Update `freq` with `(4, 0)`.
     - For \(a_5 = 9\), `rx = 1` and `ry = 1`. Pair `(1, 1)` exists in `freq` with count 1, so `count` becomes 1. Update `freq` with `(4, 1)`.
     - For \(a_6 = 6\), `rx = 4` and `ry = 0`. Pair `(4, 0)` exists in `freq` with count 1, so `count` becomes 2. Update `freq` with `(1, 0)`.
   - The final count is 2, which matches the expected output.

#### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. It efficiently uses a dictionary to track the frequency of pairs and checks the conditions for beautiful pairs using modular arithmetic.

### Final: **True**
