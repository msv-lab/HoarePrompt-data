Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `results` is a list containing the single element `count`; `freq` is a dictionary with keys as `(rx, ry)` pairs and values as the number of times each pair has been encountered; `count` is the total number of times pairs have been encountered before.**

In simpler terms, the `results` list now contains one element, which is the value of `count`. All other variables remain unchanged.
