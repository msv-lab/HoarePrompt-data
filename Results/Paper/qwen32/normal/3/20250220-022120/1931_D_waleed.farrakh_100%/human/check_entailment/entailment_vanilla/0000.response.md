### Reasoning:

The task is to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. A pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

Let's break down the provided program to see if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_2` reads the input from standard input and parses it into test cases, where each test case consists of the array size `n`, the integers `x` and `y`, and the array `arr` itself.
   - This part of the code is correct and efficiently parses the input.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - `func_1` is responsible for counting the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`. This is equivalent to finding the remainder of `-a` when divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - It calculates `ry` as `a % y`.
     - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to `count` because each occurrence of `(rx, ry)` can form a beautiful pair with the current element `a`.
     - It then updates the frequency of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.
   - This approach is correct because it leverages the properties of modular arithmetic to efficiently count the pairs that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Output:**
   - `func_2` calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. It efficiently uses a dictionary to track the frequency of pairs and checks the conditions for beautiful pairs using modular arithmetic.

Correctness: **True**
