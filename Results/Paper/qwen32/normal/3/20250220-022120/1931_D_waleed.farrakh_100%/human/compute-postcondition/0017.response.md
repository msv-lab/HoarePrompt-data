The provided code modifies the `arr` variable by reading the next line from `data` (specifically `data[idx + 1]`), splitting it into components, converting each component to an integer, and then storing the resulting list of integers back into `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1
- `n` is the first integer from `data[5]`
- `x` is the second integer from `data[5]`
- `y` is the third integer from `data[5]`
- `arr` is a list of integers from `data[4]`
- `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input
- `test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)]`
- `idx` is 5

The line `arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))` updates `arr` to be the list of integers from `data[6]` (since `idx` is 5, `idx + 1` is 6).

Therefore, the new state of `arr` is the list of integers from `data[6]`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from `data[5]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[5]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[5]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[6]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)]`, `idx` is 5**
