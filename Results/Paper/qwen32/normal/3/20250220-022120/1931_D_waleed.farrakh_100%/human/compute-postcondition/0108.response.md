Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array). The function returns `results`, which is a list containing one element for each test case in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` represents the count of previously seen `(rx, ry)` pairs for that specific test case.**
