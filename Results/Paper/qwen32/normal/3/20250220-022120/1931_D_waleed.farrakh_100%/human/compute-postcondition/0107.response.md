Output State: **The program returns `results`, which is a list containing one element for each test case in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` represents the `count` of previously seen `(rx, ry)` pairs for that specific test case.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list where each entry corresponds to a test case and indicates how many times the pairs `(rx, ry)` have been seen before in that particular test case.
