Postcondition: **`rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `test_cases` must contain at least one more tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the single element `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `freq[(rx, ry)]` is incremented by 1, and `count` is updated to `freq[(rx, ry)]`. If `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`, `freq` is updated to include `(rx, ry)` with a value of `1`, and `count` remains unchanged; `ry` is `a % y`.**
