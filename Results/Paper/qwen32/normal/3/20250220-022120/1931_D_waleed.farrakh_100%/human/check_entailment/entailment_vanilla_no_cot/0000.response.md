To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify that it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array as per the problem statement.

Here's the logic the program is supposed to follow:
1. For each test case, initialize a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.
2. For each element `a` in the array, compute `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`.
3. Check if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, add the frequency of this pair to the `count` of beautiful pairs.
4. Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
5. After processing all elements, append the `count` to the `results` list.
6. Finally, print the results for all test cases.

Let's break down the correctness of the key parts of the program:

- **Computation of `rx`**: The expression `(-a % x + x) % x` is used to compute the remainder of `-a` modulo `x` in a way that ensures the result is non-negative. This is necessary because Python's `%` operator returns a non-negative remainder for positive divisors.
- **Checking and updating the frequency dictionary**: The program correctly checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is in the `freq` dictionary and updates the `count` accordingly. It also updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

The program also handles the input and output correctly by reading the test cases and printing the results for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array.

Correctness: **True**
