You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9).
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The final values of `x` and `y` are the last pair read, and `i` is equal to the initial value of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, it prints the two integers in ascending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
3. For each pair of integers, it checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
4. This ensures that for each test case, the minimum of the two numbers is printed first, followed by the maximum.

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, processes each pair of integers, and outputs the minimum and maximum values in the correct order for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
