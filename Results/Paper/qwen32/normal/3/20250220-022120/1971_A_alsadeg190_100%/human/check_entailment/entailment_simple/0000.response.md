### Reasoning:

The given problem requires a program to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers, `x` and `y`. The output for each test case should be the minimum and maximum of these two integers, respectively.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the provided program:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that will iterate `t` times.
3. In each iteration, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
4. It compares `x` and `y`:
   - If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
5. This ensures that for each test case, the output is the minimum of the two numbers followed by the maximum.

The provided example in the problem statement matches the expected behavior of this program. For each pair of integers, the program outputs the smaller number first and the larger number second. This is consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:

Since the program correctly implements the logic to find and print the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case, and the example provided matches the expected output, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
