Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input.
- `i` is `i + 1` (This operation does not affect the print statement as `i` is not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```
print(x, y)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print(x, y)` will output the values of `x` and `y`.
- `x` is explicitly stated to be the first integer from the input.
- `y` is explicitly stated to be the second integer from the input.

Since we do not have the exact values of `x` and `y` from the input, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the input and y is the second integer from the input)**
