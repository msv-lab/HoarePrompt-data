Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`. Whether `x` is less than `y` or not, the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and the incremented value of `i` remain consistent with their initial conditions except for the increment in `i`.**
