The code snippet `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `x` and `y`. This means that the values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input provided.

The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`. However, the value of `i` is not affected by the given code snippet, and `t` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100), `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `x` and `y` are updated to the first and second integers from the input respectively, and `i` remains `i + 1`.
