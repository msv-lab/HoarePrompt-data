Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. The program first reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that iterates `t` times.
3. In each iteration, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
4. It then checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

This logic ensures that for each pair of integers, the program outputs the smaller number first, followed by the larger number, which is exactly what the problem requires.

The execution summary confirms that the function reads the input correctly and outputs the two integers in ascending order for each test case, which matches the expected behavior as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
