Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading two integers, `x` and `y`. It then prints the minimum of the two integers followed by the maximum of the two integers. The logic used in the program is straightforward and correctly handles all possible cases within the given constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9). The program does not have any logical errors or edge cases that it fails to handle. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
