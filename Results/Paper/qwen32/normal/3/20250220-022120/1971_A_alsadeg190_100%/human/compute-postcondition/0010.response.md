Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, inclusive. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input.
- There is a conditional statement that checks if `x` is less than `y`, but it doesn't affect the `print` statement.
- `i` is mentioned as `i + 1`, but `i` is not used in the provided code snippet.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x, y)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply prints the values of `x` and `y`.
- Since `x` and `y` are defined as the first and second integers from the input, respectively, the print statement will output these exact values.

### Output:
The code will print the values of `x` and `y`, which are the first and second integers from the input, respectively.

Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the input and y is the second integer from the input)**
