The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The initial state describes conditions related to the values of these variables, but the code itself only changes their values by reading input. Therefore, after the execution of the code, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will be the integers read from the input, and no other variables will be affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input and split into their respective variables. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 1` or less than `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 3` or less than `x + 3`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is calculated by iterating the formula \( z = z + \left(\frac{z}{k - 1}\right) + 1 \) for `x + 1` times, and `a` is either greater than or equal to the final value of `z` or less than the final value of `z`.**
