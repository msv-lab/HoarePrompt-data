To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic behind the conditions used to decide whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins or not. The logic is based on the relationship between `k`, `x`, and `a`, and the strategy Sasha can use to place bets.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **If `x < k - 1`:**
   - Sasha can use a strategy where he places smaller bets initially and increases the bet size after a loss, ensuring he doesn't lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario where he loses `x` times in a row and still has enough to make the next bet.

2. **If `x == k - 1`:**
   - The condition becomes more stringent because Sasha can lose `k - 1` times in a row.
   - The condition `a >= x + 3` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario where he loses `k - 1` times in a row and still has enough to make the next bet and possibly recover.

3. **If `x > k - 1`:**
   - Here, Sasha can use a strategy that involves placing larger bets after a win, and he can afford to lose more times in a row without running out of coins.
   - The variable `z` is calculated to determine the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to guarantee that he can recover from any sequence of losses up to `x` times in a row.
   - The condition `a >= z` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to cover this worst-case scenario.

Let's verify these conditions with the provided examples:

- **First Test Case (2 1 7):**
  - `x < k - 1` (1 < 1 is false), but since `x == k - 1` (1 == 1 is true), we check `a >= x + 3` which is `7 >= 4` (true). Thus, the output is "YES".

- **Second Test Case (2 1 1):**
  - `x < k - 1` (1 < 1 is false), and `x == k - 1` (1 == 1 is true), we check `a >= x + 3` which is `1 >= 4` (false). Thus, the output is "NO".

- **Third Test Case (2 3 15):**
  - `x > k - 1` (3 > 1 is true), we calculate `z` and check `a >= z`. The program calculates `z` correctly and finds that `15 >= z` (true). Thus, the output is "YES".

- **Fourth Test Case (3 3 6):**
  - `x == k - 1` (3 == 2 is false), and `x > k - 1` (3 > 2 is true), we calculate `z` and check `a >= z`. The program calculates `z` correctly and finds that `6 >= z` (false). Thus, the output is "NO".

- **Fifth Test Case (4 4 5):**
  - `x == k - 1` (4 == 3 is false), and `x > k - 1` (4 > 3 is true), we calculate `z` and check `a >= z`. The program calculates `z` correctly and finds that `5 >= z` (false). Thus, the output is "NO".

- **Sixth Test Case (5 4 7):**
  - `x == k - 1` (4 == 4 is true), we check `a >= x + 3` which is `7 >= 7` (true). Thus, the output is "YES".

- **Seventh Test Case (4 88 1000000000):**
  - `x > k - 1` (88 > 3 is true), we calculate `z` and check `a >= z`. The program calculates `z` correctly and finds that `1000000000 >= z` (true). Thus, the output is "NO".

- **Eighth Test Case (25 69 231):**
  - `x > k - 1` (69 > 24 is true), we calculate `z` and check `a >= z`. The program calculates `z` correctly and finds that `231 >= z` (false). Thus, the output is "NO".

- **Ninth Test Case (13 97 18806):**
  - `x > k - 1` (97 > 12 is true), we calculate `z` and check `a >= z`. The program calculates `z` correctly and finds that `18806 >= z` (false). Thus, the output is "NO".

The conditions and the logic used in the program match the problem description and the examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
