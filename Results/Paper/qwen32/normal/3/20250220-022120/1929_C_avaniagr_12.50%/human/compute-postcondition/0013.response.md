Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input and split into their respective variables. Additionally, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`. The current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`. The value of `a` is less than `x + 3`**
