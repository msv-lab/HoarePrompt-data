Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input and split into their respective variables. Additionally, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, the conditions remain as stated; otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 3`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated by iterating the formula \( z = z + \left(\frac{z}{k - 1}\right) + 1 \) for `x + 1` times, and `a` is compared to the final value of `z`, resulting in either `a >= z` or `a < z`.**
