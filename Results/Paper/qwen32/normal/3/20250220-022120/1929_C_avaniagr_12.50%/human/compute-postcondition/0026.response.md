Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- \( z \) is the value obtained by iterating the formula \( z = z + \left(\frac{z}{k - 1}\right) + 1 \) for \( x + 1 \) times.
- \( a \) is greater than or equal to the current value of \( z \).

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the provided code snippet is `print('YES')`. This statement is a direct print of the string 'YES' and does not depend on the values of \( z \), \( k \), \( x \), or \( a \). The values of these variables are not used in the print statement.

### Output:
Since the print statement directly outputs the string 'YES', the output is simply 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
