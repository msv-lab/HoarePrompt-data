The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself. The variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are mentioned, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of these variables.

Output: **YES**
