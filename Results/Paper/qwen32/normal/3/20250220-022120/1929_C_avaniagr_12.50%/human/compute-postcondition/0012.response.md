Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input and split into their respective variables.
- The current value of `x` is explicitly set to `k - 1`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a`. It directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
