The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the computation of the variable `z` through an iterative formula, and a condition that `a` is less than `z`. However, the value of `z` and `a` are not needed to determine the output of the `print` statement because it directly prints the string `'NO'` without referencing these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `z` is computed iteratively using the formula \( z = z + \left(\frac{z}{k - 1}\right) + 1 \) for \( x + 1 \) times.
   - `a` is a value that is less than `z`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
   - This statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` to the console.

3. **Output**:
   - Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `z` or `a`, the output is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
