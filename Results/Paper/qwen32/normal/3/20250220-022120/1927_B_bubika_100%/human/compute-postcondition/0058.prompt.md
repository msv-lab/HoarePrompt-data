Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    b = [0] * 26
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer represents the count of the corresponding index in `s`; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces; `r` is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `a` corresponding to the integers in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4; n is the input integer; a is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; b is a list of 26 integers where the first integer is len(s) and the rest are 0; s is a list of integers with all elements being 0; r is the string 'a' repeated len(s) times; x is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of `i` in `s`; `s` is a list of integers input by the user; `r` is a string formed by appending characters from `a` based on the values in `s`; `x` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
