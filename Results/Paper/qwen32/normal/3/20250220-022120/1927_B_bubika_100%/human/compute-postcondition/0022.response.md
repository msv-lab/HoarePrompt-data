The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer is 0; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces; `r` is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `a` corresponding to the integers in `s`.**
