The initial state describes several variables and their properties, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. The statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
2. The variable `i` is explicitly set to 0.
3. The variable `n` is explicitly set to 1.
4. The variable `a` is a string input from the user.
5. The variable `b` is another string input from the user, with the additional information that its second-to-last character is `'>'`.

Regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, or `b`, the `print` statement outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
