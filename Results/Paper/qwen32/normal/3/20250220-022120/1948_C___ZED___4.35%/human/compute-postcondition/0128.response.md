Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new string input from the user, `b` is the new string input from the user. If `n` is not equal to 1, then `k` is \(n - 2\) if `n` is even or \(n - 3\) if `n` is odd. If `no_path` is `True`, then `no_path` remains `True` and the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `no_path` is `False` and every character at an even index in `b` is `'>'`.**
