You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to pair each '<' with a '>' such that each pair is either in the same string and non-overlapping, or one '<' is in the first string and the paired '>' is in the second string, and vice versa. It outputs "YES" if such a pairing is possible, otherwise it outputs "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the given description.

### Reasoning:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two rows of the grid as strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Immediate Check for `b[-2]`:**
   - The program checks if the second last character in the second row `b[-2]` is not `>`. If it's not, it immediately prints "NO" and moves to the next test case.
   - This is a quick check to see if the robot can potentially reach the last column from any position in the second row, which is necessary to reach the target `(2, n)`.

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The program checks if `n` is 1. If it is, it prints "YES". However, this case is not possible according to the problem constraints (`2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`).

4. **Checking Even Indices in `b`:**
   - The program then iterates over the even indices of `b` (0, 2, 4, ...). If any of these indices do not contain `>`, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - This check ensures that the robot can move right from the even indices in the second row, which is necessary to progress towards the target.

5. **Checking Odd Indices in `a`:**
   - If the robot can move right from the even indices in `b`, the program then checks the odd indices of `a` (1, 3, 5, ...). If any of these indices do not contain `>`, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - This check ensures that the robot can move right from the odd indices in the first row, which is also necessary to progress towards the target.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - If `no_path` remains `True` after the above checks, the program prints "YES", indicating that the robot can reach the target `(2, n)`.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
- **Immediate Check for `b[-2]`:** This check is correct but not sufficient. The robot can still reach the target even if `b[-2]` is not `>` if there is a valid path through the grid.
- **Special Case for `n == 1`:** This case is not possible given the constraints, so the check is unnecessary.
- **Checking Even Indices in `b`:** This check is correct in ensuring that the robot can move right from the even indices in the second row.
- **Checking Odd Indices in `a`:** This check is also correct in ensuring that the robot can move right from the odd indices in the first row.
- **Final Decision:** The final decision logic is correct based on the checks performed.

However, the program does not handle all possible scenarios correctly, particularly the transitions between rows. The program does not account for the possibility of moving between rows and the complex interaction between the arrows in both rows.

### Example Case Analysis:
- **First Example:**
  - Input: `4`, `>><<`, `>>><`
  - The program will correctly identify that the robot can reach the target.
- **Second Example:**
  - Input: `2`, `><`, `><`
  - The program will correctly identify that the robot can reach the target.
- **Third Example:**
  - Input: `4`, `>>><`, `>><<`
  - The program will incorrectly identify that the robot cannot reach the target because it does not account for the possibility of moving between rows.
- **Fourth Example:**
  - Input: `6`, `>><<><`, `><>>><`
  - The program will correctly identify that the robot can reach the target.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all scenarios, particularly the transitions between rows. Therefore, it is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
