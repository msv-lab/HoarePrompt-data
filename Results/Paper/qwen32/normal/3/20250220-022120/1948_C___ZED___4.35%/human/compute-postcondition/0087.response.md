Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` and `b` are the new string inputs from the user. If the second last character of `b` is not `'>'`, the state remains as described. If the second last character of `b` is `'>'` and `n` is 1, the state remains as described. If the second last character of `b` is `'>'` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `no_path` is `True`, all characters at even indices in `b` are `'>'` and all characters at odd indices `k` in `a` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n-2` in steps of 2) are `'>'`. If the second last character of `b` is `'>'` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `no_path` is `False`, either any character at an even index in `b` is not `'>'` or any character at odd index `k` in `a` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n-2` in steps of 2) is not `'>'`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `no_path` is `True` and the second last character of `b` is not `'>'`, all characters at even indices in `b` are `'>'` and no character `a[k]` for `k` in the range 1 to the largest odd number less than `n` (with step 2) is equal to `'>'`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `no_path` is `False` and the second last character of `b` is not `'>'`, either any character at an even index in `b` is not `'>'` or any character `a[k]` for `k` in the range 1 to the largest odd number less than `n` (with step 2) is not equal to `'>'`.**
