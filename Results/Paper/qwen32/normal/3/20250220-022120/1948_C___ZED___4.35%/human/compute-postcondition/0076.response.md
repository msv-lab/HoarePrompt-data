Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

1. The variable `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, the value of `t` is not directly used in the print statement.
2. The variable `i` is set to 1. Again, this value is not used in the print statement.
3. The variable `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. This value is also not used in the print statement.
4. The variables `a` and `b` are new string inputs from the user. These strings are not used in the print statement.
5. The variable `no_path` is set to `False` if `a[k]` is not equal to `'>'`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains `True`. The value of `no_path` is not used in the print statement.
6. The variable `k` is set to 5.

The print statement is:
```python
print(k)
```

Since `k` is explicitly set to 5, the print statement will output the value of `k`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **5**
