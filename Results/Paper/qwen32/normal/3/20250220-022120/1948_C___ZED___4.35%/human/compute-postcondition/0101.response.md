Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the new string input from the user, `b` is the new string input from the user, `k` is 2. If the character at index `k` in `b` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**
