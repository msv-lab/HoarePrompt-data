The code snippet sets `no_path` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a string input from the user, `b` is the next string input from the user, and the second-to-last character of `b` is `'>'`. `no_path` is `False`. The current value of `b[k]` is not `'>'`.**
