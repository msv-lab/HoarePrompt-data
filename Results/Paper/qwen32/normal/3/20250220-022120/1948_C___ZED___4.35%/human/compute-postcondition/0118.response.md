Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` is set to 2.
   - `n` is greater than 5.
   - `a` and `b` are new string inputs from the user.
   - `k` is set to 5.
   - `no_path` is initially set to True, but its value changes based on the condition `if a[k] is not '>'`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on `no_path`.

2. **Code to Execute**:
   - `print(k)`

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - The variable `k` is explicitly set to 5.
   - The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`.

Since `k` is explicitly set to 5 and there are no operations or conditions that change its value before the `print` statement, the output will simply be the value of `k`.

Output: **5**
