Postcondition: **`t` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `i` is `0`. `n` is the same integer input, which is greater than or equal to 2. `a` is still the same string input from the user. `b` is still the same string input from the user, with the second-to-last character being `'>'`. `no_path` is `False`. The program has entered the if condition because `no_path` is `False`.**
