The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state includes several variables (`no_path`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of the variables does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables (`no_path`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`) are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not influence the output.

Thus, the output will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
