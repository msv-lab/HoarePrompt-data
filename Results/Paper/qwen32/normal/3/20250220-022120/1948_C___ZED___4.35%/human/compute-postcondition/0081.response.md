Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` and `b` are the new string inputs from the user, `no_path` is `True`, and `k` is the largest even number less than `n`. All characters at even indices in `b` are `'>'`, and no character `a[k]` for `k` in the range 1 to the largest odd number less than `n` (with step 2) is equal to `'>'`.**
