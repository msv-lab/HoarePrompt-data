To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `a` and `b` are new string inputs from the user.
   - `k` is 3.
   - `no_path` is initially True, but its value changes based on the condition `if a[k] is not '>' then no_path is False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `k` is explicitly defined as 3 in the initial state.
   - The value of `k` does not change anywhere in the provided information.
   - The condition involving `a[k]` and `no_path` does not affect the value of `k`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `k` is explicitly set to 3 and there is no code that modifies `k`, the `print(k)` statement will print the value 3.

Output: **3**
