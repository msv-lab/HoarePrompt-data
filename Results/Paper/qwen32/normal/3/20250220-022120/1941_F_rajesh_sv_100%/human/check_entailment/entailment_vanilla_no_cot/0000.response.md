Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed to solve the problem correctly:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function returns a `wrapper` function, but `wrapper` is not defined within `func_1`. Additionally, `d` is a local variable and will be reinitialized each time `func_1` is called, making the memoization ineffective.

2. **Function 2 (`wrapper`)**: This function is supposed to be a memoization wrapper, but it is not defined within `func_1` and `d` is not accessible from here.

3. **Memoization**: The program attempts to use memoization, but it is not correctly implemented. The memoization dictionary `d` is not properly defined or used.

4. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_6` is intended to find the optimal position to insert the new problem, but it may not correctly handle all edge cases, especially when the new problem's complexity is less than the smallest existing problem or greater than the largest existing problem.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where adding a new problem does not change the imbalance, such as when the new problem's complexity is already within the existing range of problems.

6. **Efficiency**: The program uses a binary search to find the optimal position for the new problem, but it does not efficiently handle the case where the new problem can be inserted at the beginning or the end of the list of problems.

To correct the program, the memoization should be properly implemented, and the binary search logic should be carefully reviewed to ensure it handles all edge cases correctly. Additionally, the program should consider the possibility of adding a new problem at the beginning or the end of the list of problems to minimize the imbalance.
