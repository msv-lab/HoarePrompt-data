n, m, and k are positive integers representing the number of prepared problems, the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively. A is a sorted list of n integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems. D is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models. F is a list of k integers representing the complexities of the functions.
