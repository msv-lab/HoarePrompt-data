Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; `m` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, and `F` is equal to `D`; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 5; `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`; `max_diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`; `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`; `index` is 5.**

In this output state, the variable `index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 5. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
