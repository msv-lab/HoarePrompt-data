The function `func_6` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and three lists `A`, `D`, and `F`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of prepared problems, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of models, and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of functions. The list `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems. The list `D` is a sorted list of `m` unique integers representing the complexities of the models. The list `F` is a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions.

The function returns a value based on the following cases:
Case_1: If any function complexity in `F` is less than the smallest model complexity in `D`, the function returns `0`.
Case_2: If any function complexity in `F` is greater than the largest problem complexity in `A`, the function returns `-1`.
Case_3: Otherwise, the function returns the maximum number of functions that can be assigned to the models such that each function can be handled by at least one model, and each model can handle at most one function.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and lists `A`, `D`, and `F`. It returns `0` if any function complexity is less than the smallest model complexity, `-1` if any function complexity is greater than the largest problem complexity, and otherwise, it returns the maximum number of functions that can be assigned to the models.**
