The code snippet `residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count associated with `current_key`. If `current_key` does not exist in the dictionary, it initializes the count to 1. 

Here's the breakdown of the changes:
- `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1. If `current_key` was not already in `residue_map`, it is added with a value of 1.

All other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `arr`, `r_x`, `r_y`, `num`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to its new value which is `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, and `num` is the next element in `arr`. `current_key` remains `(num % x, num % y)`.**
