Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the problem description. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a count of beautiful pairs to zero.
   - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` where `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - For each number in the array, it calculates `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - It increments the count by the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before (using the dictionary).
   - It updates the dictionary to include the current number's residue pair.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The logic of updating the residue map and counting pairs based on the residues ensures that the program correctly identifies pairs `(i, j)` where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

The code handles the constraints and edge cases well:
- It uses efficient dictionary operations to keep track of residue pairs, ensuring that the solution runs within the required time limits.
- It correctly handles the modulo operations and negative values by using `-num % x` to ensure the residue is positive.

The provided example cases are correctly handled by the program, and there are no obvious edge cases that the program would fail to handle based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
