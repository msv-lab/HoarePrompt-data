The code snippet provided updates the `current_key` variable based on the current `num`, `x`, and `y` values. The other variables, such as `test_cases`, `arr`, `results`, `count`, `residue_map`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `r_x`, `r_y`, remain unchanged or are not directly affected by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `arr` has at least one element, `num` is the next element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` plus the previous value of `count`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` as the key and its value is incremented by 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`.**

In natural language: The `current_key` is now set to a tuple containing the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. All other variables retain their previous states.
