The value of `r_y` is updated to `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated value of `r_y` along with all other variables in their initial state except for `r_y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(n % x, n % y)` mapped to 1; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(n % x, n % y)`; `num` is the second element in `arr`.**
