Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we will determine the output state after executing the code.

Initial State:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`.
- `arr` has at least one element.
- `num` is the next element of `arr`.
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.
- `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
- `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` as the key and its value is 1.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`.
- `r_x` is `-num % x`.
- `r_y` is `num % y`.
- `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`.

Code snippet:
```python
r_x = -num % x
```

The code snippet updates the value of `r_x` to `-num % x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `arr` has at least one element, `num` is the next element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` as the key and its value is 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
