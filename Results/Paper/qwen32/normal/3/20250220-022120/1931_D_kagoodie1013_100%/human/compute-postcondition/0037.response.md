The code snippet `current_key = num % x, num % y` updates the value of `current_key` to a tuple containing the remainders of `num` divided by `x` and `num` divided by `y`, respectively. No other variables are affected by this statement.

Given the initial state, the values of `num`, `x`, and `y` are used to compute `current_key`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 1 if it was not previously present, or incremented by 1 if it was, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**.
