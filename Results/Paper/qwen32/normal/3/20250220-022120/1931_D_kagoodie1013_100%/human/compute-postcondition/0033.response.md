The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must contain at least one more element that `num` can take.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is already a non-empty list, and `num` has taken on the value of the last element in `arr`. To execute one more iteration, `arr` must have had at least one more element, and `num` should now take on the value of the next element in `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 1 if it was not previously present, or incremented by 1 if it was, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `num` is the next element in `arr`**
