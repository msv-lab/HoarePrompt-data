The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If `arr` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least one element, and `num` is the first element of `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least one more element, and `num` should be the next element in `arr`.

Let's denote the next element in `arr` as `next_num`. Therefore, `num` should be updated to `next_num`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element, `arr` is a list with at least one element, `num` is the next element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` as the key and its value is 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**
