The code snippet updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count of the `current_key` by 1. The `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`. Since `residue_map` was initially empty, the count for `current_key` will be 1 after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element, `arr` is a list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` as the key and its value is 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**.

In simpler terms, the `residue_map` now contains the `current_key` with a value of 1, and all other variables remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and relationships.
