The code snippet increments the `count` variable by the value retrieved from `residue_map` using the key `(r_x, r_y)`. If the key does not exist in `residue_map`, it defaults to 0. Since `residue_map` is initially an empty dictionary, the value retrieved will be 0.

Therefore, the `count` variable will remain 0.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**
