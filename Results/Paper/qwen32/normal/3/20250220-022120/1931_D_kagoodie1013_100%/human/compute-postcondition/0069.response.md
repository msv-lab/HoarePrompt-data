The code snippet `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. The values of `test_cases`, `count`, and `residue_map` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `results` contains the final value of `count` and the newly appended `count`, `count` is the total number of times a pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before for each element in `arr`, `residue_map` contains the frequency of each `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered in `arr`.**
