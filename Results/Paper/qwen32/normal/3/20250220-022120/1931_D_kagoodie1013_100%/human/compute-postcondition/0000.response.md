Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each test case is a tuple containing a tuple (n, x, y) and a list a. Here, n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), x and y are integers (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The length of the `test_cases` list is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.**
