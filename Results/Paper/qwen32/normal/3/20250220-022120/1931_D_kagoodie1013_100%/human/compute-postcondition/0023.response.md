The code snippet `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. Since the initial state mentions that `results` is an empty list, after executing this line, `results` will contain one element, which is the value of `count`.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `count`, `residue_map`, `arr`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is the total number of times a `(r_x, r_y)` pair has been seen before for each element in `arr`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys `(num % x, num % y)` mapped to their respective counts; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`.**
