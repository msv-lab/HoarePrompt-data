Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    r_x = -num % x
    r_y = num % y
    count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
    current_key = num % x, num % y
    residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element, `arr` is a list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` as the key and its value is 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `arr` has at least one element, `num` is the next element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` plus the previous value of `count`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` as the key and its value is incremented by 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `arr` has at least one element, `num` is the next element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` plus the previous value of `count`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` as the key and its value is incremented by 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, and `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
