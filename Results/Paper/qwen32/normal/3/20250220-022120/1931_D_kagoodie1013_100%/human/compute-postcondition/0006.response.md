The code snippet provided calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and assigns it to `r_y`. However, the variable `num` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `num` is a variable from the tuple in `test_cases`, let's assume `num` is `x` from the first tuple in `test_cases` for the sake of this example.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `count` is 0.
- `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.
- `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `r_x` is 2.

Let's assume the first tuple in `test_cases` is `(n, x, y, arr)`, so `num` is `x`.

The code snippet:
```
r_y = num % y
```
will compute the remainder of `x` divided by `y` and assign it to `r_y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`; `r_x` is 2; `r_y` is `x % y`.**
