### Reasoning:

The provided code is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on the given criteria. Let's break down the logic to ensure it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The input is read in one go and split into a list of strings.
   - The number of test cases `t` is extracted.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted, followed by the array `a`.
   - These values are stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case `(n, x, y, arr)`, the code initializes a `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the frequency of `(num % x, num % y)` pairs encountered in the array.
   - For each number `num` in the array:
     - It calculates `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`.
     - It increments the `count` by the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before (using `residue_map`).
     - It updates the `residue_map` to include the current `(num % x, num % y)` pair.
   - The final `count` for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output:**
   - The `results` list, which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case, is printed.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Residue Calculation:**
  - The condition for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful is that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
  - For `a_i + a_j` to be divisible by `x`, `(a_i % x) + (a_j % x)` must be `0 % x` or `x % x` (which is equivalent to `0` in modulo arithmetic). This is equivalent to `(a_i % x) == -a_j % x` or `(a_i % x) == (x - a_j % x) % x`.
  - For `a_i - a_j` to be divisible by `y`, `(a_i % y) - (a_j % y)` must be `0 % y`, which simplifies to `(a_i % y) == a_j % y`.
  - Therefore, the pair `(a_i, a_j)` is beautiful if `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` matches `(-a_j % x, a_j % y)`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The solution uses a single pass through the array for each test case, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case.
  - The use of a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of `(num % x, num % y)` pairs ensures that the solution is efficient even for large arrays.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
