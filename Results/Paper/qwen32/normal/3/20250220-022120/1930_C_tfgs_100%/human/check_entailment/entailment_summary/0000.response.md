### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing the lexicographically largest array `b` from a set `S` that is populated by adding elements from array `a` with their respective 1-based indices. After populating `S`, `b` is formed by sorting the unique elements of `S` in descending order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Reading and Modification**:
   - The program reads `n` and the list `a` for each test case.
   - It modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1` (1-based index), effectively transforming the array `a` into a new array where each element is `a[i] + i + 1`.

2. **Unique Elements and Sorting**:
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each modified element.
   - It converts the modified array into a set to get unique elements and sorts them in descending order. This step ensures that the elements of `S` are unique and sorted as required.

3. **Constructing the Result Array `ans`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the final result.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements, appending each element to `ans`.
   - For each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list, it calculates how many intermediate values (between the two elements) should be added to `ans` to maximize the lexicographical order. This is done by considering:
     - The difference between the two consecutive elements minus 1.
     - The remaining count of elements to be added (`cnt`).
     - The current count of duplicates (`cur`).
   - It appends these intermediate values to `ans` and adjusts the counts accordingly.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - If there are still elements to be added (`cnt` > 0), it appends the last element in `ans` minus 1 for the remaining count. This step ensures that all required elements are added to `ans` to maintain the length of `n`.

The program's logic correctly handles the requirements of the problem and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.
