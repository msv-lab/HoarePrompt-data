Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task involves:
1. Given an array `a` of length `n`, perform `n` operations where each operation involves selecting an index `i`, inserting `a[i] + i` into a set `S`, and deleting `a[i]` from `a`.
2. After all operations, construct an array `b` which is the set `S` sorted in decreasing order.
3. The goal is to find the lexicographically largest possible array `b`.

### Key Points

- The set `S` only contains unique elements.
- The optimal strategy to maximize the lexicographically largest `b` involves inserting the largest possible values into `S` first.
- Since the set `S` only contains unique elements, selecting the same index `i` multiple times might result in duplicate values, which are not added to `S`.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   - For each element `a[i]`, it adds `i + 1` to it. This is done in a loop that iterates `n` times.
   - This step correctly modifies the array `a` according to the problem statement.

3. **Using a Counter:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element in `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in reverse order.

4. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted set `a` and constructs the array `b` by appending elements from the set.
   - It also handles the case where there are duplicate elements by appending the appropriate number of decremented values to `b`.

5. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program calculates the number of duplicates (`cnt`) and appends the appropriate decremented values to `b` to account for these duplicates.

### Correctness Check

- **Modification of `a`:** The program correctly modifies `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element.
- **Unique Elements:** The use of a set ensures that only unique elements are added to `S`.
- **Sorting:** The program sorts the unique elements in decreasing order, which is necessary to construct the lexicographically largest `b`.
- **Handling Duplicates:** The program correctly handles duplicates by appending the appropriate number of decremented values to `b`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the steps required to solve the problem and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
