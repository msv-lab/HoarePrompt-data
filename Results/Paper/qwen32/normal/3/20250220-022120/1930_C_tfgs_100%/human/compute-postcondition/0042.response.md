Postcondition: **`n` remains greater than 0. `a` remains a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2. If `i > 0`, `ans` will contain all the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for each `i` and `j` in the specified ranges, `counter[a[i]]` will be 0 for all `i`, `cur` will be the sum of all `counter[a[i]]` values, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, and `adv` will be recalculated in the last iteration to be the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` for the last valid `i`; `cnt` is decreased by `adv`. If `i` is not greater than 0, the program does nothing additional to the initial state.**
