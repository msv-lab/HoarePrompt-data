The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` should be decremented by 1.

Given that `cnt` must be greater than 0 at the start of the loop, after the previous iteration, `cnt` was greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `cnt` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `counter` has each element in `a` with a count of -1, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order plus any additional elements calculated during the loop based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, and an additional element which is the last element of the previous `ans` minus 1**.
