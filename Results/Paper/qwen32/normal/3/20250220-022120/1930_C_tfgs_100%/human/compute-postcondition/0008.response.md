Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` integers where `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, `a_2` is `a_2 + 2`, `a_3` is `a_3 + 3`, ..., `a_n` is `a_n + n`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, each element in the list `a` is increased by its 1-based index. For example, the first element `a_1` is increased by 1, the second element `a_2` is increased by 2, and so on, up to the `n`-th element `a_n` which is increased by `n`. The variable `i` will be `n-1` after the loop finishes, as it will have taken on all values from 0 to `n-1` during the iterations.
