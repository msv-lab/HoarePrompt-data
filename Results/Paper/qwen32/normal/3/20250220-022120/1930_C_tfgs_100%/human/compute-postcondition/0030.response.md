The code snippet `cur += counter[a[i]]` increments the variable `cur` by the value of `counter[a[i]]`. This means that the value of `cur` is updated to include the count of the element `a[i]` from the `counter` dictionary.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2
- `ans` contains its previous elements plus `a[i]`
- `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1

The only change in the output state is the value of `cur`, which is increased by `counter[a[i]]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2; `ans` contains its previous elements plus `a[i]`; `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1; `cur` is increased by `counter[a[i]]`.**
