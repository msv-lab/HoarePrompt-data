Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

### Problem Recap
The problem requires us to perform a series of operations on an array `a` and construct a set `S` by inserting unique values of `a_i + i` (where `i` is the 1-based index). After these operations, we need to construct an array `b` by sorting the elements of `S` in decreasing order. The goal is to maximize the lexicographical order of `b`.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the given program and verify it step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   - The program modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1` to it. This is done correctly in the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(n):
         a[i] += i + 1
     ```

3. **Using a Counter:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element in `a`:
     ```python
     counter = Counter(a)
     ```
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in reverse order:
     ```python
     a = list(set(a))
     a.sort(reverse=True)
     ```

4. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted set `a` and constructs the array `b` by appending elements from the set:
     ```python
     ans = []
     for i in range(len(a)):
         if i > 0:
             adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
             for j in range(adv):
                 ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
             cnt -= adv
             cur -= adv
         ans.append(a[i])
         counter[a[i]] -= 1
         cur += counter[a[i]]
     for _ in range(cnt):
         ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
     print(*ans)
     ```

### Detailed Evaluation

1. **Modification of `a`:** The program correctly modifies `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element, which aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Unique Elements:** The use of a set ensures that only unique elements are added to `S`.

3. **Sorting:** The program sorts the unique elements in decreasing order, which is necessary to construct the lexicographically largest `b`.

4. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program calculates the number of duplicates (`cnt`) and appends the appropriate number of decremented values to `b` to account for these duplicates.
   - The logic for handling duplicates seems correct. The variable `adv` calculates the number of additional elements to insert between consecutive elements in the sorted set `a`.

### Critical Points

- The program correctly handles the insertion of unique values into `S` and sorts them in decreasing order.
- The logic for handling duplicates ensures that the lexicographically largest array `b` is constructed.

### Conclusion
After a thorough analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required operations and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
