Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `counter` has each element in `a` with a count of -1, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order plus any additional elements calculated during the loop based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, and an additional element which is the last element of the previous `ans` minus 1. The last element of `ans` has been updated to be the previous last element of `ans` minus 1.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `n` is still greater than 0, `a` remains the same, `i` is still the length of `a`, `counter` remains with each element of `a` having a count of -1, `cur` is still 0, `cnt` is still 1, and `ans` has a new element appended to it, which is the previous last element of `ans` minus 1.
