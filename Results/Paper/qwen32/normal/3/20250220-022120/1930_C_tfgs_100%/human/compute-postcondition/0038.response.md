Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2; `ans` contains its previous elements plus `a[i - 1] - j - 1`; `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1; `cur` is increased by `counter[a[i]]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be at least 1; `j` is `j - 1`.**

In simple terms, the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` is appended to the list `ans`. The other variables retain their previous values, except for `ans`, which now includes the newly appended value.
