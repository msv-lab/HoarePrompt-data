The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `adv`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, and `adv` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` and greater than 0, `ans` contains a new element `a[i - 1] - 1`, `j` is 1**
