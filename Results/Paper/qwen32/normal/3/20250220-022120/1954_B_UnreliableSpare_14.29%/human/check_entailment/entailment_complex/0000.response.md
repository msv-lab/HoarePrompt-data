### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. According to the problem definition, an array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.

**Analysis of the Program:**

1. **Check if All Elements are the Same:**
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the previous one. If it finds any element that is different from the previous one, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks the loop.
   - If `flag` remains `True` after the loop, it means all elements are the same, and the function prints `-1` because no elements need to be removed to make it non-beautiful.

2. **Finding the Minimum Consecutive Sequence Length:**
   - If the array is not entirely composed of the same element, the program then finds the minimum length of consecutive elements equal to the first element of the array.
   - It initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` to `0`. As it iterates through the array, if it encounters an element equal to `val` (the first element), it increments `cnt`. If it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, then resets `cnt` to `0` for the new sequence.
   - After the loop, it performs a final comparison to ensure the last sequence is considered.

3. **Output the Result:**
   - If `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of consecutive elements equal to the first element.

### Issues and Correctness:

- **Issue with `ans` Calculation:**
  - The program calculates `ans` as the minimum length of consecutive elements equal to the first element of the array. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, which is not necessarily related to the minimum length of consecutive elements equal to the first element.
  - For example, in the fourth test case, the array is `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The minimum length of consecutive `3`s is `3`, but removing `3` elements is not the correct answer. The correct answer is `3` because removing the first three `3`s results in `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

- **General Approach:**
  - The program's current approach does not correctly handle the problem's requirement to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It needs to consider all possible ways to break the beauty condition, not just the minimum length of consecutive elements equal to the first element.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It calculates an incorrect value for the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

**Correctness: False**
