The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. This operation does not affect the variables `t` and `n` or the list `a` mentioned in the initial state. The new list `arr` is created based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input value; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
