### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the code and the function summary in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`. If it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, we should return `-1`.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Check if the array is uniform**:
   ```python
   flag = True
   for i in range(1, n):
       if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
           flag = False
           break
   ```
   This part correctly checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, the array is already uniform, and the correct answer is `-1` because no removal can make it non-beautiful.

2. **Calculate the minimum number of elements to remove**:
   ```python
   ans = Decimal('Infinity')
   (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
   for i in range(n):
       if arr[i] == val:
           cnt += 1
       else:
           ans = min(ans, cnt)
   ans = min(ans, cnt)
   ```
   This part attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element `arr[0]`. However, it has several issues:
   - It only considers the first sequence of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` and does not account for other potential segments.
   - It does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple segments of different elements.
   - The logic assumes that removing the shortest segment of the first element will make the array non-beautiful, which is not necessarily true.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the minimum length of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`. This summary is partially accurate but does not fully capture the logic needed to solve the problem correctly.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It fails to consider multiple segments and their lengths properly. For example, in the fourth test case:
```
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The correct answer is `3` because removing the first three elements or the last three elements results in an array that is not beautiful. However, the provided solution might not correctly identify this.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases and thus is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
