Reasoning:
The program aims to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The approach taken by the program is as follows:

1. **Initial Check for Uniformity**: It first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make such an array not beautiful by removing elements.

2. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Sequence**: If the array is not uniform, the program then tries to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same. It does this by iterating through the array and counting consecutive elements equal to the first element (`arr[0]`). Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum count (`ans`) and resets the counter (`cnt`).

3. **Final Output**: After the loop, it performs a final check to update `ans` with the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements. It then outputs `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property of the array.

However, the program does not correctly handle all cases. Consider the following scenarios:

- **Case 1**: The array has multiple different elements, but the minimum consecutive sequence is not the correct answer to break the beautiful property. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the minimum consecutive sequence is `1` (for the `5`), but removing just one `5` does not make the array stop being beautiful. The correct answer here is `3`, as removing the first three `3`s results in `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

- **Case 2**: The program only considers sequences starting from the first element. It does not account for sequences of other elements that might be shorter and could break the beautiful property if removed.

Thus, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of elements to remove for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
