Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues with the code:

1. The code does not properly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The main logic for calculating `ans` is flawed. The code tries to find the minimum count of consecutive elements, but this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

2. The `ans` variable is initialized to `Decimal('Infinity')` and then updated by comparing with the count of consecutive elements. However, this does not correctly address the problem statement, which requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break the "beautiful" property.

3. The `flag` variable is used to check if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1`. This part is correct as per the problem statement.

4. The logic to find the answer is not correctly implemented. The code does not consider the structure of the array and the operations defined in the problem statement. It does not check if removing a specific element can break the "beautiful" property of the array.

To solve the problem correctly, one should look for the longest subarray that can be made uniform by the given operation and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break this uniformity. This involves more complex logic than simply finding the minimum count of consecutive elements.
