The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means `n` will now hold the value of the integer input provided. The other variables, `t` and `a`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input value; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
