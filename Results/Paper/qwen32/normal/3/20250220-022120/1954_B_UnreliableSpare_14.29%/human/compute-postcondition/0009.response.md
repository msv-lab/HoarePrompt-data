The code snippet provided only initializes a new variable `flag` to `False`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `i`) are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 4; `flag` is False.**
