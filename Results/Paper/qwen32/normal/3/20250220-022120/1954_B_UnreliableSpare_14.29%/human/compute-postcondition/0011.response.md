Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 4. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `flag` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of `flag` and the loop remains unchanged.**
