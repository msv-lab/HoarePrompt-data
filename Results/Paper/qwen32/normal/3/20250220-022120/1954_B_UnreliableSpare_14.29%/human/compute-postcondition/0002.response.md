The given code snippet only initializes a variable `flag` to `True`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input value; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `flag` is True.**
