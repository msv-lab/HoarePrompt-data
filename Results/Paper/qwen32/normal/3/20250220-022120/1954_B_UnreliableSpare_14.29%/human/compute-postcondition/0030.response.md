The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of the variable `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is either 1 or 2. After the execution, `cnt` will be 2 or 3, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input value and must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False; `ans` is Decimal('Infinity') if `arr[i]` equals `val` and `cnt` was 1, otherwise `ans` is 0; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is either 2 or 3; `arr[i]` either equals or does not equal `val`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
