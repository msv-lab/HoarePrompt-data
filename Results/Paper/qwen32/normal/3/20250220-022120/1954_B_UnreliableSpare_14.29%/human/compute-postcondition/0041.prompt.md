You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is the integer input value; a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; arr is a list of integers derived from the input; flag is True if all elements in arr are the same; otherwise, flag is False.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input value and must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False; `ans` is the minimum length of sequences of consecutive elements equal to `val` found during the loop, or `Decimal('Infinity')` if all elements are the same; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`; `i` is `n`.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement will output `-1`.
        #
        #Output:
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum length of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to arr[0])
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input value and must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `flag` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `arr` are the same; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`; `i` is `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the properties of the list `a`, which is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
