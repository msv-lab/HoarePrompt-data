Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ m) and m (m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5)), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. The following m lines each contain three integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v), and w (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6), representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. There is at most one edge between each pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain loops. The sum of the values of m for all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.**
