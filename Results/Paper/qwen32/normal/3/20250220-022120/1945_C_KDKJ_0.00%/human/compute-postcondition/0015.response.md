Postcondition: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]` where `x` is `2` and `y` is `0` if `s` is `'0'` and `a` is `'0'`, `x` is `1` and `y` is `1` if `s` is `'0'` and `a` is not `'0'`, `x` is `1` and `y` is `1` if `s` is not `'0'` and `a` is `'0'`, and `x` is `0` and `y` is `2` if `s` is not `'0'` and `a` is not `'0'`. `s` is the next character in the string `a`. `x` is `1` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `0`. `y` is `1` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `y` is `2` if `s` is not `'0'`.**

Let's simplify this for better readability:

Postcondition: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]` where `x` and `y` are updated based on the value of `s` and `a`. If `s` is `'0'`, then `x` is `2` and `y` is `0` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `1` and `y` is `1`. If `s` is not `'0'`, then `x` is `1` and `y` is `1` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `0` and `y` is `2`. `s` is the next character in the string `a`. `x` is `1` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `0`. `y` is `1` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `y` is `2` if `s` is not `'0'`.**

To make it even more understandable:

Postcondition: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]` where `x` and `y` are updated based on the value of `s` and `a`. If `s` is `'0'`, `x` is `2` and `y` is `0` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `1` and `y` is `1`. If `s` is not `'0'`, `x` is `1` and `y` is `1` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `0` and `y` is `2`. `s` is the next character in the string `a`.**
