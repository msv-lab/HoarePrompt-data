To determine the output state, we need to consider the initial state and the effect of appending a new list `[x, y]` to `S`. The values of `x` and `y` are determined by the value of `s` (the next character in the string `a`) and the value of `a`.

Given:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input.
- `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]` where `x` and `y` are updated based on the value of `s` and `a`.
- `s` is the next character in the string `a`.

The rules for `x` and `y` are:
- If `s` is `'0'`, `x` is `2` and `y` is `0` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `1` and `y` is `1`.
- If `s` is not `'0'`, `x` is `1` and `y` is `1` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `0` and `y` is `2`.

Let's break this down based on the value of `s` and `a`:

1. **If `s` is `'0'`:**
   - If `a` is `'0'`, then `x` is `2` and `y` is `0`.
   - Otherwise, `x` is `1` and `y` is `1`.

2. **If `s` is not `'0'`:**
   - If `a` is `'0'`, then `x` is `1` and `y` is `1`.
   - Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `2`.

Since `s` is the next character in the string `a`, we can assume `s` is `a[1]` if `a` has at least two characters. If `a` has only one character, `s` would be `a[0]`.

Let's consider the updated `S` after appending `[x, y]`:
- `S` was initially `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`.
- After appending `[x, y]`, `S` becomes `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]`.

Since the specific values of `x` and `y` depend on the value of `s` and `a`, we need to express the output state in terms of these conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]` where `x` and `y` are determined by the value of `s` (the next character in `a`) and `a` as described above.**

In natural language: The integer `n` and the string `a` remain unchanged. The list `S` now contains an additional element `[x, y]`, making it `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]`, where `x` and `y` are determined by the next character `s` in the string `a` and the value of `a` itself, following the specified rules.
