Let's analyze the provided loop and the state information.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will iterate `int(input())` times. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0.
- `func_1()` has been called.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, the only state we need to consider for the next iteration is the value that `int(input())` will produce, which determines the number of iterations remaining.

Let's denote the number of iterations left by `iterations_left`. At the end of the previous iteration, `iterations_left` would have been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `iterations_left` must be greater than 0.

Given that `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0, let's assume that the user input was `k` at the start of the previous iteration. This means the loop was supposed to run `k` times. After the previous iteration, `iterations_left` would be `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `iterations_left` must be `k - 1 > 0`, which means `k > 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `int(input())` must produce a value such that `iterations_left` is still greater than 0.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1; `func_1()` has been called.**
