The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use. However, the loop's continuation depends on the result of `int(input())`, which must be a positive integer greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` must have returned a positive integer greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must again return a positive integer greater than 0.

Since the underscore `_` does not hold any state that needs to be adjusted, and `func_1()` has already been called, the only state we need to ensure is that the next call to `int(input())` will return a positive integer greater than 0.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0; `func_1()` has been called.**
