### Reasoning:
The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which together aim to solve the problem of determining the optimal position to lay the road in the village of Letovo. Here is a detailed breakdown of how the program works and whether it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function handles a single test case.
   - It reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
   - It constructs a list `S` where each element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to that point in the string `a`.
   - It then iterates through possible positions `i` to determine if placing the road after the `i`-th house satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - It keeps track of the position `ans` that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies the condition.
   - Finally, it prints the position `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly constructs the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's using the list `S`.
- It checks the condition for each possible position `i` correctly, ensuring that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
- It keeps track of the position `ans` that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies the condition.
- The program handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the optimal position to lay the road for each test case and handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
