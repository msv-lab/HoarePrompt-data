Postcondition: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x', y']]` where `x` and `y` are determined by the value of `s` (the next character in `a`) and `a` as described above, `s` is the next character in `a`. If `s` is '0', then `x'` is `x + 1` and `y'` is `y`. Otherwise, `x'` is `x` and `y'` is `y + 1`.**
