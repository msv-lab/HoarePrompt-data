To accurately predict the output state, we need to know the definition of the function `func_1()` as it is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Without this information, it's impossible to determine how the function affects the variables or what values are returned or changed.

However, if we assume that `func_1()` does not modify any variables in the given initial state and simply returns a value or performs operations without side effects, we can only state that the function has been called.

Given the lack of details about `func_1()`, the most accurate output state we can provide is that the function has been executed, and the precondition remains valid.

Output State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0; `func_1()` has been called.**
