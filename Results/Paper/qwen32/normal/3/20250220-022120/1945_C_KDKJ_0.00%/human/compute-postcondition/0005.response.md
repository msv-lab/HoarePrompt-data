Since the provided code snippet is simply calling `func_1()` again and there is no definition or impact of `func_1()` provided in the initial state, we can assume that calling `func_1()` does not change any variables or states mentioned. Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1; `func_1()` has been called.**
