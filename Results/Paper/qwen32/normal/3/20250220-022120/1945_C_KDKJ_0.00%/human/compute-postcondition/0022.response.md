The code snippet appends a new list `[x, y]` to the list `S`. Given the initial state, `S` is initially `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x', y']]`. After appending `[x, y]`, `S` will be `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x', y'], [x, y]]`.

The variables `n`, `a`, `x`, `y`, `x'`, and `y'` remain unchanged. The character `s` and its impact on `x'` and `y'` also remain unchanged as they were used to determine the values of `x'` and `y'` before the append operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x', y'], [x, y]]`, `s` is the next character in `a`. If `s` is '0', then `x'` is `x + 1` and `y'` is `y`. Otherwise, `x'` is `x` and `y'` is `y + 1`.**
