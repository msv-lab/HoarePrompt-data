The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given the context, it seems like this code is part of a loop where `i` is the loop variable. Since `continue` is used, none of the variables listed in the initial state will be modified by this statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a string provided by the user input, `S` is a list of `[x, y]` pairs where the first element is `[0, 0]` and each subsequent element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative counts of `'0'`s and non-`'0'`s up to that character in the string `a`, `ans` is either the original `ans` or `i` depending on the condition, `satisfy` is 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - lsum`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**
