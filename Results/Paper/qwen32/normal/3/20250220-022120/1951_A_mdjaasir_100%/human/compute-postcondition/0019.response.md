Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`, `count` is greater than 0, and either `count` is less than or equal to 2 or `count` is odd. If `count` is 2, the element in `a` immediately following the first occurrence of '1' is either not '1' or '1'. Otherwise, `count` is not equal to 2.**
