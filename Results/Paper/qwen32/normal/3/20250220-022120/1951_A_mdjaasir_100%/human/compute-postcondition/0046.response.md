Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the user input, `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The postcondition remains the same regardless of whether `count` is greater than 2 and even, or not.**
