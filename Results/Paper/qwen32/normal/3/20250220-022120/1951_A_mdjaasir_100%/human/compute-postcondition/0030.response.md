Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the postcondition is that the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `count` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1, regardless of whether the condition `a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1'` is true or false.
