The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `count`) and their properties, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely dependent on the string provided within it.

Given that the `print` statement is `print('YES')`, it will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
