The given `print` statement in the Python code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

The initial state provides information about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `count`, `i`), but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply outputting the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement is static and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will always be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
