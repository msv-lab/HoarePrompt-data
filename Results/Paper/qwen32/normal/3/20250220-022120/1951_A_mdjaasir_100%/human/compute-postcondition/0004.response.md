The code snippet `count = a.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `a` and assigns this count to the variable `count`. 

The variables `start`, `end`, `t`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is only being read.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`.**
