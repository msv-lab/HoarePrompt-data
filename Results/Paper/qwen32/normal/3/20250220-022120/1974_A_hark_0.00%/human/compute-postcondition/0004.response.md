To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_2()` does. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided information, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables or if it returns any value. 

However, based on the given initial state and the provided code snippet, we can only conclude that `func_2()` is called, but without further details about its implementation, we cannot provide specific changes to the variable `t` or any other variables.

Given the lack of information about `func_2()`, the output state remains the same as the initial state, assuming `func_2()` does not modify `t` or any other variables mentioned.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\)**
