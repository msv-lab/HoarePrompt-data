You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. It is also ensured that it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.

    #State: `x` and `y` are integers within the range 0 <= `x` <= 99 and 0 <= `y` <= 99.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the input, where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions: if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it computes a specific formula and prints the result; if only `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`; if only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`; if both are 0, it prints 0.

    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of times to execute `func_2()`. It then calls `func_2()` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place x 1x1 icons and y 2x2 icons. Each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons or a combination of 1x1 and 2x2 icons that fit within the 5x3 grid.

### Key Observations:
1. **2x2 Icons:** Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since each screen is 5x3 (15 cells), we can fit a maximum of 3 2x2 icons per screen (3 * 4 = 12 cells), leaving 3 cells free.
2. **1x1 Icons:** Each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell. We can fit up to 15 1x1 icons per screen.
3. **Mixing Icons:** We need to consider how to optimally place 1x1 and 2x2 icons together to minimize the number of screens.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of three functions:
1. **func_1(a, b):** This function returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. However, it is not used in the program.
2. **func_2():** This function handles the logic for a single test case.
   - It reads the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and 2x2 icons (`y`).
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - It calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`). This is incorrect because each screen can hold up to 3 2x2 icons, not 2.
     - It then adjusts `x` and calculates additional screens needed for 1x1 icons. The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect.
   - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`math.ceil(y / 2)`), which is also incorrect.
   - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons (`math.ceil(x / 15)`), which is correct.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it correctly outputs 0.
3. **func_3():** This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2()` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
The logic in `func_2()` is flawed. Specifically:
- The calculation for the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is incorrect. Each screen can hold up to 3 2x2 icons, not 2.
- The adjustment for 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons is incorrect.
- The overall approach for mixing 1x1 and 2x2 icons is not optimal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem due to incorrect logic for handling 2x2 icons and mixing 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
