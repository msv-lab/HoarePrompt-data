The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the input, where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions: if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it computes a specific formula and prints the result; if only `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`; if only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`; if both are 0, it prints 0.
