The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. The loop will execute as long as the range generated by `t` has more elements. Since the underscore `_` does not affect the loop's continuation, we only need to adjust `t` to reflect the number of remaining iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\). After one iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1 (since the loop runs `t` times, decreasing `t` by 1 with each iteration).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since one iteration has just completed, `t` should now be one less than its previous value.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4 - 1\)**

However, to be more precise and ensure clarity, we should state that `t` is now one less than its previous value:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\)**
