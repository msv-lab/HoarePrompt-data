To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of `func_2()`. However, the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided code snippet or initial state. Without the definition of `func_2()`, we cannot determine how it affects the variables or the program state.

Given the lack of information about `func_2()`, we can only assume that `func_2()` does not alter the variable `t` or introduce any new variables, as no other information is provided. If `func_2()` does not modify `t` or any other variables, the state remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
