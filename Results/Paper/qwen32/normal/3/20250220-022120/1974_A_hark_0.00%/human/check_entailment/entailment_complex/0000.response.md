### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it can hold a maximum of 15 (5*3) 1x1 icons or a maximum of 3 (1 complete 2x2 grid can fit in a 5x3 grid, and 2 more 2x2 icons can fit partially, but we consider only full 2x2 grids) 2x2 icons.
2. **Icon Placement**:
   - Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, meaning it can fit 3 such icons on a 5x3 grid.
   - The remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
  - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold a maximum of 3 2x2 icons, we need to round up `y / 3` to the nearest integer.
  - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line seems incorrect. The intention should be to calculate the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. However, the calculation `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. Instead, it should be `x - bxsfory * 4`.
  - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. However, the `+1` seems incorrect because it always adds an extra screen even if no 1x1 icons are left.
- **Case 2: Only `y` is greater than 0**:
  - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This is correct. Each screen can hold 3 2x2 icons, so we need `math.ceil(y / 3)` screens.
- **Case 3: Only `x` is greater than 0**:
  - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This is correct. Each screen can hold 15 1x1 icons, so we need `math.ceil(x / 15)` screens.
- **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
  - `print(0)`: This is correct. No screens are needed if there are no icons.

#### Correct Implementation:
The provided code has some logical errors in the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 3)  # Each screen can hold 3 2x2 icons
        remaining_1x1 = x - bxsfory * 4  # Calculate remaining 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons
        bxsfory1 = 0 if remaining_1x1 <= 0 else math.ceil(remaining_1x1 / 15)  # Calculate additional screens for 1x1 icons
        print(bxsfory + bxsfory1)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 3))
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
            else :
                print(0)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code has logical errors in the calculation of screens needed when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
