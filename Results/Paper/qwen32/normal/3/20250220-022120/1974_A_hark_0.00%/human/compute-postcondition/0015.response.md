Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers within the range 0 <= `x` <= 99 and 0 <= `y` <= 99. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, it is ensured that it is not the case that both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.**
