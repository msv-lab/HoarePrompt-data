The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. Since `t` is already given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once. There is no need to adjust `t` further, as it is already within the valid range for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
