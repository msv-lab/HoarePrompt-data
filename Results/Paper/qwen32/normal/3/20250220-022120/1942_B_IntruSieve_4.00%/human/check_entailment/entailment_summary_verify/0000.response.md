### Reasoning:

Let's evaluate the provided program against the problem description and the function summary, and compare it with the original assessment.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- We need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that for each \( i \), \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- The program should handle multiple test cases, each with its own permutation and array \( a \).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Here's a breakdown of its logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to 0. These are used to track the smallest unused integer (`minn`) and the maximum value encountered (`maxx`).
   
2. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element in the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i \) is positive, it appends `minn` to the result list `mex` and increments `minn`. It also checks if `minn` equals `maxx` and updates `minn` accordingly.
     - If \( a_i \) is non-positive, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the result list `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary.

3. **Output**:
   - It prints the constructed list `mex` for each test case.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
  - The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the constructed permutation \( p \) up to the current index \( i \). It uses `minn` to track the smallest non-negative integer not yet used, but this approach does not account for the values already used in \( p \).
  - The logic for handling negative values in \( a \) is incorrect. It calculates the element of \( p \) as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

- **Tracking Used Values**:
  - The program does not maintain a set or a boolean array to track which integers have been used in \( p \). This is crucial for correctly determining the MEX.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly construct the permutation \( p \):
1. **Track Used Values**:
   - Use a set to keep track of which integers have been used in \( p \).
2. **Determine MEX**:
   - For each element \( a_i \), determine the smallest non-negative integer not in the set (MEX) and calculate \( p_i \) as \( \text{MEX} - a_i \).
3. **Add to Permutation**:
   - Add \( p_i \) to the permutation and update the set of used values.

#### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = 0
    used = set()
    p = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p_i = mex - arr[i]
        used.add(p_i)
        p.append(p_i)
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

#### Comparison with Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the provided program, particularly the incorrect calculation of MEX and the handling of negative values in \( a \). The original assessment also provides a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
