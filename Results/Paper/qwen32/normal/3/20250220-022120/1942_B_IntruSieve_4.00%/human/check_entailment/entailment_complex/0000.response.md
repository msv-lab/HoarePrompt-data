The provided program, as annotated, does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for constructing the permutation `p` from the array `a` is flawed. Let's reason through why this is the case.

### Problem Recap

Given an array `a` of length `n`, we need to construct a permutation `p` such that for each `i` from `1` to `n`, the following holds:

\[ a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

Where `MEX` of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Flaws in the Program

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation and Permutation Construction**:
   - The program attempts to construct the permutation `p` (which they refer to as `mex` in the code) by iterating through the array `a`.
   - It increments `minn` (which should be the MEX of the current prefix of `p`) whenever it encounters a positive number in `a`.
   - For negative numbers, it calculates the value to append to `mex` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, which is not the correct way to determine the next element in `p`.

2. **Logic for Handling Negative Numbers**:
   - The logic for handling negative numbers in `a` is incorrect. The program attempts to adjust `maxx` based on the absolute difference between the negative number and `minn`, but this does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **General Approach**:
   - The program does not correctly track which numbers have been used in the permutation `p`, which is necessary to correctly compute the MEX.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:

1. **Track Used Numbers**:
   - Maintain a set or list to keep track of numbers that have been used in the current permutation `p`.

2. **Compute MEX**:
   - For each element in `a`, compute the MEX of the current permutation `p`.
   - Determine the next element of `p` based on the formula `a_i = MEX - p_i`, which implies `p_i = MEX - a_i`.

3. **Ensure Valid Permutation**:
   - Ensure that the constructed `p` is a valid permutation (i.e., it contains each integer from `0` to `n-1` exactly once).

### Conclusion

Given the flaws in the provided program's logic, it does not correctly solve the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
