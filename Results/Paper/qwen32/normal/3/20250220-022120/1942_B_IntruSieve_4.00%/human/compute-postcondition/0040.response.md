To determine what will be printed by the `print(itm, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and identify the value of `itm`.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `mex` is a list of `n` integers.
- `n` must be greater than the current index of `itm` + 1.
- `minn` is the final count of positive numbers in `arr` (adjusted by the rule that if `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments by 1).
- `maxx` is the maximum absolute difference between any non-positive `arr[i]` and the current `minn`.

### Key Points:
- The variable `itm` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the condition `n` must be greater than the current index of `itm` + 1, `itm` appears to be an index or an element within the `mex` list.
- The `print(itm, end=' ')` statement suggests that `itm` is expected to be a value that can be printed, most likely an integer from the `mex` list or an index.

### Determining the Output:
Since `itm` is not explicitly defined, we need to infer its value based on typical usage in such contexts. Given that `itm` is used in the context of an index or an element from the `mex` list, and considering the precondition that `n` (length of `mex`) must be greater than the current index of `itm` + 1, `itm` is likely an index or an element from `mex`.

However, without the exact value of `itm` or the specific context in which `itm` is set, we can't determine its exact value. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of what `itm` represents.

### Output Description:
The `print(itm, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `itm` followed by a space. Since `itm` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe its value as an element or index from the `mex` list.

Output: **itm (where itm is an element or index from the mex list)**
