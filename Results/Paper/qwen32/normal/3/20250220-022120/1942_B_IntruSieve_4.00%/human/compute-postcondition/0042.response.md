To determine what will be printed by the `print(itm, end=' ')` statement, we need to understand the context and the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be greater than the current index of `itm` + 2.
- `minn` is the final count of positive numbers in `arr`, adjusted by a rule that if `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments by 1.
- `maxx` is the maximum absolute difference between any non-positive `arr[i]` and the current `minn`.
- `itm` is an integer that is part of the `mex` list.

### Analysis:
- The `print(itm, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `itm` followed by a space, without adding a newline at the end.
- The value of `itm` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is described as an element of the `mex` list.

Given that `itm` is an element of the `mex` list, the output will be the value of `itm` itself, followed by a space.

### Output Description:
Since `itm` is an element of the `mex` list and we don't have the specific value of `itm`, we can describe the output in terms of `itm`.

Output: **itm (where itm is an element of the mex list)**
