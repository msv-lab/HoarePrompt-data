To determine the output state after the loop completes all iterations, we need to understand how the variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` evolve based on the input array `arr`.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the input list `arr`. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the variables are updated:

- **Initialization**: 
  - `mex` is an empty list.
  - `minn` is initialized to 0.
  - `maxx` is initialized to 0.

- **Loop Body**:
  - For each element `arr[i]`:
    - If `arr[i] > 0`:
      - Append `minn` to `mex`.
      - Increment `minn` by 1.
      - If `minn` equals `maxx`, update `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
    - If `arr[i] <= 0`:
      - Append `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.
      - Update `maxx` to `abs(arr[i] - minn)` if it is greater than the current `maxx`.

After the loop completes all `n` iterations, `mex` will contain `n` elements, each determined by the conditions described above. `minn` and `maxx` will have final values based on the sequence of positive and non-positive numbers in `arr`.

### Final Output State
- `mex`: A list of `n` integers, each calculated based on whether the corresponding element in `arr` was positive or non-positive.
- `minn`: The final value of `minn` after all iterations.
- `maxx`: The final value of `maxx` after all iterations.

### Natural Language Description
- `mex` will be a list of `n` elements, where each element is either the value of `minn` (if the corresponding `arr[i]` was positive) or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` (if the corresponding `arr[i]` was non-positive).
- `minn` will be the final count of positive numbers encountered in `arr`, adjusted by the rule that if `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments by 1.
- `maxx` will be the maximum value encountered in the list `mex`, which is the maximum absolute difference between any non-positive `arr[i]` and the current `minn`.

Given the loop structure and the input constraints, the output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is the final count of positive numbers in `arr` (adjusted by the rule that if `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments by 1), and `maxx` is the maximum absolute difference between any non-positive `arr[i]` and the current `minn`.**
