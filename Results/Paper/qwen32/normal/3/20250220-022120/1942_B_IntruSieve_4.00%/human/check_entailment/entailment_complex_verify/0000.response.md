### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the given program, letâ€™s analyze the problem requirements and the provided program step-by-step using the annotations.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that for each index \( i \), \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex = []`: List to store the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn = 0`: Tracks the smallest non-negative integer not yet used.
   - `maxx = 0`: Tracks the maximum absolute difference between any non-positive `arr[i]` and the current `minn`.

2. **Processing Each Element in `arr`:**
   - **Positive `arr[i]`:**
     - `mex.append(minn)`: Adds the current `minn` to the permutation.
     - `minn += 1`: Increments `minn` to the next smallest non-negative integer.
     - If `minn == maxx`, `minn = maxx + 1`: This adjustment is not clearly justified and seems arbitrary.
   - **Non-positive `arr[i]`:**
     - `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))`: Adds the computed value to the permutation.
     - Updates `maxx` if necessary.

3. **Output:**
   - Prints the constructed permutation `mex`.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation:**
  - The program does not correctly track the MEX of the constructed permutation up to the current index. It uses `minn` to track the smallest unused integer, but this approach fails when `arr[i]` is negative or when the smallest unused integer changes.
  
- **Handling Negative Values:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the element of \( p \) as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for negative `arr[i]`. This does not align with the requirement to find the MEX.

- **Updating `minn` and `maxx`:**
  - The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` does not ensure the correct MEX is calculated. Specifically, `minn` is incremented only when `arr[i]` is positive, which is not a reliable method to track the smallest unused integer.

#### Example Case Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
The program might output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```
However, this output is not guaranteed to be correct as the program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation for negative values of `arr[i]`.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly construct the permutation \( p \), we need:
1. Track the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in \( p \) using a set or boolean array.
2. For each element \( a_i \), determine the corresponding \( p_i \) such that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

The corrected version of the program provided in the original assessment addresses these issues and ensures the correct MEX calculation.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given array \( a \).

**Final: False**
