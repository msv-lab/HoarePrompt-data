The code snippet provided assigns the value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the variable `maxx`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `i`, and `mex` remain unchanged as per the provided code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `mex` contains the previously existing elements plus the new element `abs(arr[i] - minn)`; `maxx` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`**

In natural language: The value of `maxx` is now the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. All other variables retain their initial values.
