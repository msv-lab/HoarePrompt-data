The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `mex`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `arr`. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the creation of the `mex` list, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is an empty list.**
