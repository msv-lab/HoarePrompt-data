To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `N` is the first integer read from the input.
- `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`.
- `num` is `final_num`.
- `s` is the first value of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and `s` is not equal to 1.
- `e` is the second value of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`.
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- If `ppp` is equal to 23, then `ppp` remains equal to 23. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
- `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input.
- If `tc` is greater than 5, then `tc` is greater than 5.
- `eli` is the insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`.

The print statement is:
```
print(s - 1, s)
```

We need to determine the values of `s` and `s - 1` based on the given initial state.

From the initial state, we know:
- `s` is the first value of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.

Since `s` is not equal to 1, `s - 1` will be the integer immediately preceding `s`.

Thus, the print statement will output `s - 1` followed by `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first value of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr and s is not equal to 1)**
