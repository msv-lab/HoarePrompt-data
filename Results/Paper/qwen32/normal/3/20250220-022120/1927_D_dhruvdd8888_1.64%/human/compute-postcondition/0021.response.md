The code snippet provided assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `s`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `i + 2` from a previous operation, and `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, i - 1, num)` appended to it. The value of `s` will now be updated to the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 2`; `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, i - 1, num)` appended to it; `s` is `i + 2`.**

In natural language: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `N` retains its value as the first integer read from the input, `i` is `i + 2`, `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, i - 1, num)` appended to it, and `s` is now equal to `i + 2`.
