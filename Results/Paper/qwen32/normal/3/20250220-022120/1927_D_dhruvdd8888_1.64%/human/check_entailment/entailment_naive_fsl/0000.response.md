Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for finding a pair of different elements within the specified range `[l, r]` is flawed. Here are some issues and a counterexample:

1. **Incorrect Range Handling**: The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts within the range `[l, r]`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the segment overlaps the range or where multiple segments are present within the range.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not correctly handle cases where all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
2
1 2
2 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1 -1
2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

### Explanation of the Counterexample:
- For the query `1 2`, the elements are `1 1`. Since all elements are the same, the output should be `-1 -1`, which is correct.
- For the query `2 5`, the elements are `1 2 1 1`. Here, the elements `1` and `2` are different, so the output should be `2 3` or any valid pair of indices where the elements are different. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly when multiple segments are present within the range `[l, r]` or when the range contains different elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
