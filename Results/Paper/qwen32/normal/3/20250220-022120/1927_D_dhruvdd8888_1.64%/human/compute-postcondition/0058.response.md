To determine what will be printed by the `print(l, r)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided.

### Analyzing the Initial State

1. **t**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This variable represents the number of test cases.
2. **N**: The first integer read from the input. This likely specifies the length of the `nums` list.
3. **nums**: A list of integers where:
   - `nums[0]` is `n` (the number of elements in the sequence `a`).
   - `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - `nums[-1]` is `-1` (a sentinel value).
4. **num**: This variable is described as `final_num`, but it's not clear what `final_num` is based on the given information.
5. **arr**: A list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`.
6. **LA**: This is `len(arr) - 1`, so it represents the last index of `arr`.
7. **ppp**: If `ppp` is equal to 23, it remains 23. However, the value of `ppp` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
8. **l and r**: These are two integers read from the input. These are the values that will be printed.
9. **tc**: If `tc` is greater than 5, it is greater than 5. However, the value of `tc` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
10. **eli**: This is the insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`. This value is not directly relevant to the output of `print(l, r)`.
11. **s and e**: These variables are described based on conditions involving `l` and `r`, but their exact values are not needed to determine the output of `print(l, r)`.

### Determining the Output

The `print(l, r)` statement will output the values of `l` and `r` as they are read from the input. Since the specific values of `l` and `r` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output

Output: **l, r (where l and r are the two integers read from the input)**
