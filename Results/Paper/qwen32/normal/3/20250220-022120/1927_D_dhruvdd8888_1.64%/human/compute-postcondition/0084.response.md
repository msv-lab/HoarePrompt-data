The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs two constants, `-1` and `-1`. The initial state describes various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is determined solely by the values provided in the statement itself.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
2. The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables described in the initial state (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `ppp`, `l`, `r`, `tc`, `eli`, `s`, `e`) are used in this `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output will be the two integers `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
