Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a_i != a_j`. If no such pair exists, we need to output `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to be using a preprocessing step to create a list of intervals where the elements of the array are the same. The idea is to use binary search to quickly find the intervals that overlap with the query range `[l, r]`.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Queries for Large Test Cases**:
   - The program contains a conditional `if tc > 5` that skips processing queries for test cases beyond the 5th one. This is incorrect and results in incomplete output for those test cases.
   
2. **Incorrect Interval Handling**:
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the interval that starts within the query range `[l, r]`. It then checks if the interval starts before `l` or ends after `r` to determine if a pair can be found.
   - However, the logic for handling these intervals is flawed. For example, if the interval starts before `l` but ends within `[l, r]`, the program should still check if there are other intervals within `[l, r]` that have different values.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the interval starts and ends within `[l, r]` but has the same value.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same.
   - It also does not handle cases where the range `[l, r]` contains only one element correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program is not correctly solving the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
