The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1, -1`. This output is independent of the values of the variables `t`, `N`, `nums`, `num`, `s`, `e`, `arr`, `LA`, `ppp`, `l`, `r`, and `tc` as described in the initial state.

The `print` statement is straightforward and explicitly outputs `-1, -1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
2. This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1` separated by a space.
3. The values of the variables mentioned in the initial state do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **-1, -1**
