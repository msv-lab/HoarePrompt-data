The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `s`. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `i`, and `arr`) are not directly affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1` from a previous operation, and `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it. Since `s` is being updated to `i` in this step, the tuple in `arr` would reflect the old value of `s` before this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it; `s` is `i`.**
