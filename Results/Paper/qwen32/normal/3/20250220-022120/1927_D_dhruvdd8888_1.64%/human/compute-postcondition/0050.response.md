To determine the output of the `print(s, e + 1)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of `s` and `e`.

### Key Information from the Initial State:

1. **`arr`**: This is a list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`. Each tuple in `arr` contains three values: the starting value of the sequence, the ending value of the sequence, and the length of the sequence.

2. **`LA`**: This is `len(arr) - 1`, which represents the index of the last tuple in `arr`.

3. **`eli`**: This is the insertion point for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`. It is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would fit in the sorted list `arr`.

4. **`s`**: This is the first value of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. This means `s` is the starting value of the sequence at the minimum of `eli` and `LA`.

5. **`e`**: This is the second value of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. This means `e` is the ending value of the sequence at the minimum of `eli` and `LA`.

6. **`l` and `r`**: These are two integers read from the input. `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and `e` is less than `r`.

### Analysis:

- The value of `s` is determined by the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- The value of `e` is determined by the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- The print statement outputs `s` and `e + 1`.

### Output Description:

Given the initial state, the output will be the starting value of the sequence (`s`) and the ending value of the sequence plus one (`e + 1`). Since `s` and `e` are determined by the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the starting value of the sequence at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and e is the ending value of the sequence at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**

This format adheres to the requirement of providing the most precise description possible based on the given information.
