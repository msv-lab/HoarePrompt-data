The given code snippet initializes two variables, `ma` and `mi`, to 0. Since no further operations are performed on these variables in the provided code, their values remain unchanged. The initial state describes the input format, which is not directly affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `ma` and `mi` while maintaining the description of the input format.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0.**
