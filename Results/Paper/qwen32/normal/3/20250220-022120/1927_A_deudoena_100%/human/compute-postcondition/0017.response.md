Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `mi` is 2 if the second character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is 3, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the third character of `s`. If `j` is 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simple terms: The value of `c` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables retain their initial values.
