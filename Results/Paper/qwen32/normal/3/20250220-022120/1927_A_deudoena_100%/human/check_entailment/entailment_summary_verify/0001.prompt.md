You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and returns the number of cells between the first and last black cells ('B') in a given string `s` of length `n`, inclusive, plus two. The string `s` consists of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) cells, and it is guaranteed to contain at least one 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make all cells in the strip white. The strip is represented by a string of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters.

### Key Points:
1. We need to find the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string.
2. The minimum length of the segment to paint white is the distance between these two 'B's plus one (since the segment is inclusive).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1()` that is supposed to compute the minimum length of the segment to paint white. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function does:
1. It initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0. These are meant to store the indices of the last and first 'B' respectively.
2. It reads the length of the strip `m` and the strip itself `s`.
3. It then iterates through the string `s` to find the first occurrence of 'B'. When it finds the first 'B', it sets `mi` to the current index (1-based) and breaks the loop.
4. It then iterates through the reversed string `s[::-1]` to find the last occurrence of 'B'. When it finds the last 'B', it sets `ma` to the length of the string minus the current index (1-based) and breaks the loop.
5. Finally, it returns `ma - mi + 2`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. The program uses 1-based indexing for `mi` and `ma`, which is not a problem in itself but can be confusing.
2. The return statement `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment is inclusive. Adding 2 would overestimate the length of the segment by one.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation in the return statement.

### Correctness: **False**

Hence, the final answer is:
Correctness: **False**
