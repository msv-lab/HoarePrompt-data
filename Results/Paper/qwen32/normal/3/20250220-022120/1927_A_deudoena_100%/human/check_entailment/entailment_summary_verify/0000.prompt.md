You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and returns the number of cells between the first and last black cells ('B') in a given string `s` of length `n`, inclusive, plus two. The string `s` consists of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) cells, and it is guaranteed to contain at least one 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white in order for all cells to become white. The logic in the program is flawed and does not handle all cases correctly.

Let's analyze the program with a few test cases:

### Test Case 1:
```
Input:
1
3
BBW

Output (Expected):
2

Output (Program):
3
```

### Test Case 2:
```
Input:
1
4
BWWB

Output (Expected):
4

Output (Program):
4
```

### Test Case 3:
```
Input:
1
6
WBBWBW

Output (Expected):
4

Output (Program):
5
```

### Explanation of the Program:
The program tries to find the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string and then calculates the length of the segment between them plus 2. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of multiple segments of 'B' that might require a shorter segment to cover all 'B's.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would be to find the longest continuous segment of 'B's in the string. This segment will determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to cover all 'B's.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_len = 0
    current_len = 0
    for j in s:
        if j == 'B':
            current_len += 1
        else:
            max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
            current_len = 0
    max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
    return max_len

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())
```

This implementation correctly finds the longest continuous segment of 'B's and outputs its length, which is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to cover all 'B's.
