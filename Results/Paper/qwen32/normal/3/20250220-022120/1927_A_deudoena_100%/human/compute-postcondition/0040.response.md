Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of the strip and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. The function returns the value of `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string `s`, and `mi` remains unchanged.**
