The code snippet assigns the integer value of the input to the variable `m`. The initial state mentions that `m` is not defined, and `ma` and `mi` are both 0. After the code execution, `m` will hold the value of the first input integer, representing the number of test cases.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is the number of test cases.**
