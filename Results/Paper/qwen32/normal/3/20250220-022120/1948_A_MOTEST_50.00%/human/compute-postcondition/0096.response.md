The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('YES')`. This statement directly prints the string 'YES' to the console. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `ans`, and `x` are described in the initial state, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
