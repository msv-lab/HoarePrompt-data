Postcondition: **`t` is greater than `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `i` is `i + 1`. If `n` is 6, `ans` is 'AABBCC' and `x` is 3. If `n` is 7, `ans` is 'AAABBCCDD' and `x` is 4. If `n` is neither 6 nor 7, the values of `ans` and `x` are not specified.**
