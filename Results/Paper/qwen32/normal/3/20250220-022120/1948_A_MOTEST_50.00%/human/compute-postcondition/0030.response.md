The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `x` is 3, so `s[x]` is `s[3]`, which is the character 'D'. Therefore, 'D' repeated twice ('DD') is appended to `ans`.

The initial value of `ans` is 'AAABBBCC', so after appending 'DD', `ans` becomes 'AAABBBCCDD'. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that `n` is at least 7 and `n` is odd, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AAABBBCCDD', `x` is 3, `j` is 2**
