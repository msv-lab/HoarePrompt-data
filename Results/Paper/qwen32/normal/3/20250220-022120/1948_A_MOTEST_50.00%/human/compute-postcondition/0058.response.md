The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 2 and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', the character at index 2 in `s` is 'C'. Therefore, 'CC' is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 5 and not divisible by 2, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 'AAABBBCC', `x` is 2, `j` is 2**
