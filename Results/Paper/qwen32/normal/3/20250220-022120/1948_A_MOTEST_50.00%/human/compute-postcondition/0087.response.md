The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **We need to adjust `n` to be at least `5` to ensure the loop can execute; `t`, `i`, `s`, `ans`, `x` are not in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute; `ans` is updated to `ans + s[x] * 2`; `x` is increased by 1.**
