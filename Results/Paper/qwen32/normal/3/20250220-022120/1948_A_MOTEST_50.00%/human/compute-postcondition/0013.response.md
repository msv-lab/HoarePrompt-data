The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AA', `x` is 1.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AA', `x` is 1**.
