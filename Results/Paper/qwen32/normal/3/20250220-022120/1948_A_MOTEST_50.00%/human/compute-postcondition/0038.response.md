`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is between 1 and 50, but it is now replaced by the new input value. The other variables `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is incremented by 1**
