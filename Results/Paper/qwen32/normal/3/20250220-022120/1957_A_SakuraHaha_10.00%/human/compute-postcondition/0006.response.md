The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` to the next element in the list `a` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `cnt` is a dictionary with the count of `x` incremented by 1, it indicates that `x` has already been processed in the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `x` should be the next element in the list `a`.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the current index of `x` in the list `a`, we can infer that `x` was the first element in the list `a` during the first iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `x` should be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is 1 (or any integer between 1 and 100, inclusive), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the count of `x` incremented by 1, `x` is the second element in the list `a`**
