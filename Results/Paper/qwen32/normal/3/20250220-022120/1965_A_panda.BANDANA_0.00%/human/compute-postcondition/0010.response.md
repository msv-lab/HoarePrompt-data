Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`; `m` is the length of the list `l`. If `l` contains the integer 1, then `e` includes 1. Otherwise, the number 1 is not in the list `l`.**
