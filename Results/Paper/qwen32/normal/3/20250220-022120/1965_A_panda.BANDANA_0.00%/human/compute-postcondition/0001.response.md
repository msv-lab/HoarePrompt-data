In the given for loop, the loop head involves the variables `i` and `t`. The variable `i` is the loop index, and `t` is the number of iterations the loop will perform. The variables `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range(t)` function, so we do not need to set it manually before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
