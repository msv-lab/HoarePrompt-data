The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are not affected by this line of code, as they are not mentioned or initialized in the provided snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not yet initialized.**
