You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)



- Annotated Code:

for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The loop completes all iterations without printing anything.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list of `n` + 1 integers, where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are the values provided in the input. If `n` equals 2, the program does not perform any additional operations within the if block. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations without printing anything.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. For a friend to attend, both the friend and their best friend must receive invitations. 

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Invitations**:
   - If `n == 2`, the program correctly returns `2` since both friends must be invited.
   - For `n > 2`, the program checks if there exists a triplet of friends `(i, v[i], v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a triplet exists, it means that by inviting two friends in this triplet, at least two friends will come to the party, and the program returns `2`.
   - If no such triplet is found, the program returns `3`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Case 1 (n == 2)**: The program correctly returns `2` because both friends need to be invited in this scenario.
- **Case 2 (n > 2)**:
  - The program checks for the existence of a triplet `(i, v[i], v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is sufficient for ensuring that by inviting two friends, at least two friends will attend the party.
  - However, the program does not cover all possible scenarios. For example, if there are two disjoint pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` such that `v[a] = b` and `v[b] = a`, and `v[c] = d` and `v[d] = c`, then inviting `a` and `c` would result in `b` and `d` attending, but the program would not recognize this and would return `3` instead.

### Example Counter Case:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
2 1 4 3
```
In this case, the best friend relationships form two disjoint pairs: `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`. By inviting friends `1` and `3`, both `2` and `4` will attend the party, making the minimum number of invitations `2`. However, the program would return `3` because it does not find a triplet `(i, v[i], v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible configurations of best friend relationships, particularly when there are multiple disjoint pairs.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
