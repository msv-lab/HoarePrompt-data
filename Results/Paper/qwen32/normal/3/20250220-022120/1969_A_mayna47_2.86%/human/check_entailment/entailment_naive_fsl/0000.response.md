Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for the problem description. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that if there exists a cycle of length 3 (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`), then only 2 invitations are needed. However, this is not always the case.

Consider the following example:
```
Input:
1
4
2 3 4 1
```
In this case, the best friends form a cycle of length 4: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1. The program will check for a cycle of length 3 and not find one, so it will print 3. However, it is possible to invite only 2 friends (e.g., friends 1 and 2) and have both of them come to the party, since friend 1 and friend 2 are each other's best friends, and similarly, friend 3 and friend 4 are each other's best friends.

Another example:
```
Input:
1
5
2 3 4 5 1
```
Here, the best friends form a cycle of length 5. The program will check for a cycle of length 3 and not find one, so it will print 3. However, it is possible to invite only 2 friends (e.g., friends 1 and 2) and have both of them come to the party, since friend 1 and friend 2 are each other's best friends.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all cases and should be considered incorrect.
