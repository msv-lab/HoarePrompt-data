The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into integers, and assigns these integers to the list `v` starting from the second position (index 1), with the first position (index 0) being set to 0. Therefore, the list `v` will now have `n + 1` integers, where the first integer is 0 and the remaining `n` integers are the values provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i; `v` is a list of n + 1 integers, where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are the values provided in the input.**
