The code snippet provided reads an integer `n` from the input. This value of `n` will replace the previous value of `n` in the initial state. The other variables `t` and `p` are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i.**
