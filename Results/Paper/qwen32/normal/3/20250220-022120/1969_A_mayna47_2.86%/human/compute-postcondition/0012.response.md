The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `v`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is solely determined by the `print(2)` statement itself.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(2)`.
2. The value `2` is explicitly provided in the statement.
3. No other variables or conditions affect the output of this statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
