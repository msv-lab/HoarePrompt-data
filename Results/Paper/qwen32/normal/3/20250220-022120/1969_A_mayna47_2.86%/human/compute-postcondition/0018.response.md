Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= n and `p_i` != i; `v` is a list of n + 1 integers, where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are the values provided in the input. Additionally, `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`; `i` is 5. The program returns nothing. If `v[v[v[i]]]` were equal to `i`, the program would return nothing, but since `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`, the program continues without any changes to the variables and returns nothing.**
