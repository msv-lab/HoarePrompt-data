Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list of `n` + 1 integers, where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are the values provided in the input. If `n` equals 2, the program does not perform any additional operations within the if block. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations without printing anything.**
