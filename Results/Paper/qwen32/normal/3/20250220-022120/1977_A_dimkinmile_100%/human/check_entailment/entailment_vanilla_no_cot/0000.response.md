To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. We need to determine if it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity of Moves and Difference**:
   - If `m` is achievable, then the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, so the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes must be even.
   - Additionally, `n - m` must be non-negative because it's not possible to end up with more cubes than the total number of moves.

2. **Logic in the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `kreker`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`.
     - If true, it prints "Yes".
     - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Evaluation:
- The program correctly checks both conditions: the difference `n - m` must be even and non-negative.
- If both conditions are met, it correctly outputs "Yes", indicating that it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.
- If either condition is not met, it correctly outputs "No", indicating that it is not possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

### Conclusion:
The program implements the correct logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
