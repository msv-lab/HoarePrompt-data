You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes in the tower using `n` moves, under the condition that the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative. It prints "Yes" if the condition is met, otherwise "No".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. We need to determine if, after `n` moves, it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial State:** The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Possible Moves:** Each move can either increase or decrease the number of cubes by 1.
3. **Parity Consideration:** If `n` is the total number of moves and `m` is the final number of cubes, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and an even number of such changes is required to reach an exact number `m` from 0.
4. **Non-Negative Moves:** Since Nikita cannot have a negative number of cubes, `n - m` must be non-negative (i.e., `n >= m`).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows the correct logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
- If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Example Walkthrough:
- **Test Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `n - m = 0` (even and non-negative), so the output is "Yes".
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `n - m = -2` (negative), so the output is "No".
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `n - m = 2` (even and non-negative), so the output is "Yes".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks the necessary conditions for the problem and outputs the correct result for each test case.
Correctness: **True**
