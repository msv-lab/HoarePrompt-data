Given the initial state and the condition provided, we can analyze the code snippet as follows:

Initial State:
- `n` is the number of moves from the input.
- `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower from the input.
- Either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('No')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`. The condition provided does not affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not depend on the values of `n` or `m` in any way that modifies the output string.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **No**
