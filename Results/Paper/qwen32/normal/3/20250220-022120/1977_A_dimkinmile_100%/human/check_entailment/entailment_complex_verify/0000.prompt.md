You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) where n is the number of moves and m is the desired number of cubes in the tower.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `n` is the number of moves from the input, `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower from the input. If the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, then the current value of `n - m` is even and greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes in the tower using `n` moves, under the condition that the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative. It prints "Yes" if the condition is met, otherwise "No".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is not sufficient to determine whether it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` is even. This condition is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, so the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between `n` and `m` must match.
- `n - m >= 0` checks if the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the number of cubes `m`. This is necessary because you cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

However, the condition `n - m >= 0` is not sufficient on its own. It does not account for the possibility that `m` could be greater than `n` if `n` is odd. For example, if `n` is 1 and `m` is 0, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` would evaluate to `True` because `(1 - 0) % 2 == 0` and `1 - 0 >= 0`, but it is impossible to end up with 0 cubes after 1 move.

A correct condition should be `abs(n - m) % 2 == 0` to ensure that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, regardless of whether `n` is greater than or less than `m`.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `1 0`
- Expected Output: `No`
- Actual Output: `Yes` (incorrect)

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
