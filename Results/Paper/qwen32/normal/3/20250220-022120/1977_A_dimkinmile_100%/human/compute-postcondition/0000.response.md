The code snippet provided reads a single line of input containing two integers `n` and `m` and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m` respectively. Given the initial state, the values of `n` and `m` are not predefined but are instead determined by the input. The initial state mentions that `n` is the number of moves and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` will be specific to the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is the number of moves from the input, `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower from the input.**
