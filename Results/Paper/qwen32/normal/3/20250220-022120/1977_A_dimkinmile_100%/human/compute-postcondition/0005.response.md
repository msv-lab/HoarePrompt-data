Postcondition: **`n` is the number of moves from the input, `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower from the input. If the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, then the current value of `n - m` is even and greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`.**
