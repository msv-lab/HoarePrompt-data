### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1()` and see if it accurately solves the problem based on the given constraints and examples.

The problem states that for each test case, we need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower. 

Here's the key insight: 
- If `m` cubes are to be achieved after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even and non-negative. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, so to go from 0 cubes to `m` cubes with `n` moves, the number of additions must exceed the number of subtractions by exactly `m`, and the total number of moves (additions + subtractions) must be `n`. The difference between the number of additions and subtractions will be `m`, and since each move is either an addition or a subtraction, the total number of moves `n` minus the desired number of cubes `m` must be even (since the difference between two equal parity numbers is even).

The provided function correctly implements this logic:
- It reads `n` and `m` for each test case.
- It checks if `n - m` is even and non-negative.
- If the condition is met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Let's verify the function with the provided examples:
1. **Test Case 1: `n = 3`, `m = 3`**
   - `n - m = 3 - 3 = 0`, which is even and non-negative.
   - Output: "Yes" (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2: `n = 2`, `m = 4`**
   - `n - m = 2 - 4 = -2`, which is even but negative.
   - Output: "No" (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3: `n = 5`, `m = 3`**
   - `n - m = 5 - 3 = 2`, which is even and non-negative.
   - Output: "Yes" (Correct)

Since the function correctly handles the provided examples and adheres to the logic derived from the problem statement, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
