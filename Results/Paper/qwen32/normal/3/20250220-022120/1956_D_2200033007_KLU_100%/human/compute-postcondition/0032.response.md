Initial State: 
- `i` will be `i + (n - 1)`.
- `arr[j]` (for \(j\) in the range \([start_index, start_index + i + (n - 1)]\)) will be equal to `i + (n - 1)`.
- `start_index` remains unchanged.
- `is_already_stairs` remains unchanged.
- `res` remains unchanged.

Given the provided code snippet:
```python
make_stairs(i - 1)
```
The function `make_stairs` is called with the argument `i - 1`. However, the code snippet provided does not actually modify `i` or `arr` directly; it simply calls a function with a specific argument. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the state of `i` and `arr` should reflect the changes as per the description in the initial state, but the function call itself does not change these variables.

Output State: **`i` will be `i + (n - 1)`, `arr[j]` (for \(j\) in the range \([start_index, start_index + i + (n - 1)]\)) will be equal to `i + (n - 1)`, `start_index` remains unchanged, `is_already_stairs` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: The value of `i` will be incremented by `n - 1`, and all elements in the array `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i + (n - 1)` will be set to this new value of `i`. The `start_index`, `is_already_stairs`, and `res` remain unchanged. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called, but it does not affect the output state of the variables.
