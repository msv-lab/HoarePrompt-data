The code modifies the value at `arr[start_index]` to be 1. The values of `i`, `is_already_stairs`, and `res` remain unchanged. The condition that for at least one `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j` may still hold, depending on the values of `arr` and `j`, but it is not guaranteed because `arr[start_index]` has been set to 1.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, and `i` equals 0. `is_already_stairs` is False. `arr[start_index]` is 1. `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. For at least one `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j` (this condition may or may not still hold).**
