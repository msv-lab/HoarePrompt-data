The function `func_2` takes two integer parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, representing a range within an array `arr`. It returns a list of tuples representing subarray indices that satisfy specific conditions based on the values in `arr` and the calculated `max_value`. The function may return an empty list, a list with a single tuple, or the result of recursive calls to itself.
