The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement, `j` iterates from 0 to `i` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, which means the loop has just finished executing for the current value of `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be reset to 0 because the loop starts from 0 in each new iteration of the outer context (assuming there is an outer loop controlling `i`).

The states of `i` and `is_already_stairs` are not controlled by the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(arr) - start_index, `j` is 0, and `is_already_stairs` is False if `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains True.**
