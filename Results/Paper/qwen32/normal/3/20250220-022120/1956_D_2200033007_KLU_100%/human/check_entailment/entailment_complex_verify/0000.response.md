### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's go through the problem description and the annotated code systematically.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX (Minimum EXcluded Value).
- **Constraints**: 
  - Number of elements in the array, `n`, is between 1 and 18.
  - Each element `a_i` is between 0 and 10^7.
  - Operations can be performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Function Calls**:
   - The program reads the input and initializes `arr` and `res_dict`.
   - It then calls `func_1(0, n - 1)` to compute the maximum possible sum.
   - It calls `func_2(0, n - 1)` to determine the sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Compute the maximum sum for a subarray `arr[start_index:end_index + 1]`.
   - **Logic**:
     - If the subarray has only one element, return `max(1, arr[start_index])`.
     - Otherwise, compute the maximum sum by considering:
       - The sum of the entire subarray if it can be transformed into a sequence of consecutive integers (i.e., MEX is the length of the subarray).
       - The sum of subarrays split at each possible position `i` with the element `arr[i]` included.
       - The sum of subarrays by excluding `arr[start_index]` or `arr[end_index]` and recursively computing the maximum sum for the remaining parts.
   - **Memoization**: Uses `res_dict` to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Determine the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - **Logic**:
     - If the subarray has only one element, return an operation if the element is 0.
     - If the subarray can be transformed into a sequence of consecutive integers, call `make_stairs` and return the operation.
     - Otherwise, find the position `i` that maximizes the sum by splitting the subarray and recursively determine the operations for the subarrays.
   - **Global Variables**: Relies on `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` which are defined globally.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - **Purpose**: Transform a subarray into a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0.
   - **Logic**:
     - Check if the subarray is already a sequence of consecutive integers.
     - If not, recursively transform the subarray by setting each element to the appropriate value and appending the operation to `res`.

#### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

The original assessment identifies several issues with the program:
1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The code is incomplete as it relies on global variables and does not explicitly compute the MEX.
2. **Lack of Global Variables**: The use of global variables without proper initialization can lead to errors.
3. **Logic for Finding MEX**: The code does not explicitly compute the MEX of any subarray.
4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same, arrays with a single element, or arrays with very large values.
5. **Output Format**: The code does not produce the required output format.

#### Detailed Analysis:

- **MEX Calculation**: The program does not explicitly compute the MEX of any subarray. Instead, it assumes that the maximum sum can be computed by transforming the subarray into a sequence of consecutive integers. This approach is valid because the MEX of a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0 is the length of the sequence.
- **Global Variables**: The use of global variables `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` is consistent throughout the functions, and they are properly initialized before the function calls.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as arrays with a single element and arrays with all elements being the same by returning the appropriate operations.
- **Output Format**: The program correctly outputs the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

#### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array by transforming subarrays into sequences of consecutive integers, which is equivalent to replacing subarrays with their MEX values. The program handles edge cases and produces the required output format.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
