Postcondition: **`i` is an integer such that 0 < i < len(arr) - start_index, and `is_already_stairs` is either True or False. If `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`, then `is_already_stairs` is set to True, and `arr` is modified to form a staircase pattern starting from `start_index + i - 1` to `start_index + i`. Otherwise, `i` is updated to `i + (n - 1)`, `arr[j]` (for \(j\) in the range \([start_index, start_index + i + (n - 1)]\)) is set to `i + (n - 1)`, `start_index` remains unchanged, `is_already_stairs` remains unchanged, and `res` remains unchanged.**
