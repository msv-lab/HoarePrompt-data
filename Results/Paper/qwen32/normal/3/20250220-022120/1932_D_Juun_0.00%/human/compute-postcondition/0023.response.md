Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 16, `trump` is a character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `card` is the next card in the input sequence, `rank` is the first element of `card`, `suit` is the second element of `card`, `trumps` is updated based on `rank` and `suit`. If `suits[suit]` is not None, `answers` is updated to include a new string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, each concatenated with the `suit` character, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is updated to `rank`.**
