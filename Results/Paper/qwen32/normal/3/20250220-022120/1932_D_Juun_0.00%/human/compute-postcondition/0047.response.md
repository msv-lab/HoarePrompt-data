The `print` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The statement is:

```python
print('IMPOSSIBLE')
```

This statement will print the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'` exactly as it is, regardless of the state of the variables `trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, `t`, `n`, `rank`, and `suit`.

Here is the breakdown of the reasoning:

- The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`.
- None of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state (`trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, `t`, `n`, `rank`, and `suit`) are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output is not influenced by the values or states of these variables.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
