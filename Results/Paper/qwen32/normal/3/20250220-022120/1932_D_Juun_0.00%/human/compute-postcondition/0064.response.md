To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the operations performed by the code.

### Initial State Recap:
- `trumps` must contain at least one element.
- `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one entry for each non-`None` rank in `suits` (or fewer if `trumps` was exhausted).
- `suits` remains unchanged.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```
This line of code uses the `pop()` method to remove and return the last element from the `trumps` list twice. It then concatenates each popped element with the value of the variable `trump` and prints the result.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **First `trumps.pop()`**:
   - This will remove and return the last element from the `trumps` list.
   - Let's denote this element as `trumps_last_element_1`.

2. **Concatenation with `trump`**:
   - The code then concatenates `trumps_last_element_1` with the value of `trump`.
   - Let's denote this concatenated string as `concatenated_1`.

3. **Second `trumps.pop()`**:
   - This will remove and return the new last element from the `trumps` list (since the previous element was popped).
   - Let's denote this element as `trumps_last_element_2`.

4. **Concatenation with `trump`**:
   - The code then concatenates `trumps_last_element_2` with the value of `trump`.
   - Let's denote this concatenated string as `concatenated_2`.

5. **Printing**:
   - The code prints the final formatted string which is `concatenated_1` followed by a space and then `concatenated_2`.

### Output Description:
- The output will be a string that consists of the last two elements of the `trumps` list, each concatenated with the value of `trump`, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Given the lack of specific values for `trumps` and `trump`, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **trumps_last_element_1[trump] trumps_last_element_2[trump] (where trumps_last_element_1 and trumps_last_element_2 are the last two elements of the trumps list, and trump is the value of the trump variable)**
