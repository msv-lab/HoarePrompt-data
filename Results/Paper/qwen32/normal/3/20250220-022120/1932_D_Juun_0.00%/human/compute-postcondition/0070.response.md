The only variable in the loop head is `answer`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `answers` list. If there are more entries in `answers`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `answer` is the next entry in `answers`. For the loop to execute one more time, `answers` must contain at least one more entry, and `answer` will be the next entry in the list.

State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` contains at least two entries, `suits` remains unchanged, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `answer` is the next entry in `answers`**
