Postcondition: **`trumps` contains all ranks of trump cards, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards, `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair (e.g., `{'hearts': None}`), `t` and `n` remain unchanged. If `rank` is `None`, then `rank` remains `None`. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined as there is no else part specified.**
