The `print('IMPOSSIBLE')` statement directly prints the string 'IMPOSSIBLE' regardless of the values of the variables `trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, `t`, `n`, or `rank`. The precondition does not affect the content of the print statement since the string to be printed is explicitly provided.

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
