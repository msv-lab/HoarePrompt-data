Postcondition: **`trumps` contains all ranks of trump cards except the last one or two, depending on whether the if condition was true or false. `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one or two new entries formatted as `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`. `suits` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs. `t` and `n` remain unchanged. If `rank` was `None` initially, `rank` and `suit` are updated to the next key-value pair in the `suits` dictionary. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns None.**
