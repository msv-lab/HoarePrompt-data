Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 16, `trump` is a character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `card` is the next card in the input sequence, `rank` is the first element of `card`, `suit` is the second element of `card`, `trumps` is updated to include `rank`, `answers` is updated based on `rank` and `suit`, and `suits[suit]` is updated based on `rank` and `suit`.**

In simple terms, the `trumps` list now includes the `rank` of the `card` that was just processed. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
