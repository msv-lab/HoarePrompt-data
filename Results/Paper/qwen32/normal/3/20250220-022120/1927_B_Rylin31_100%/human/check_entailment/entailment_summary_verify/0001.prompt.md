You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        s = [0 for i in range(l)]
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = ''
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it constructs and prints a string based on a list of integers. Each integer in the list specifies the position in the alphabet for the next character in the string, with the position being incremented each time it is used.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `array` of length `n`.

2. **Logic to Reconstruct the String:**
   - The program initializes a list `s` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. This list is intended to keep track of how many times each character has been used so far.
   - It then initializes an empty string `ans` to build the final string.
   - For each value `j` in the trace array:
     - It appends a character to `ans` based on the value of `s[j]`. Specifically, it appends the character `chr(s[j] + 97)`, which corresponds to the lowercase letter at position `s[j]` in the alphabet (since `chr(97)` is 'a', `chr(98)` is 'b', etc.).
     - It increments `s[j]` by 1 to reflect that the character at this position has been used once more.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the program prints the constructed string `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic of the program is correct because it ensures that the character at position `i` in the final string `ans` is chosen based on the number of times that character has been used before, as specified by the trace array.
   - The trace array `a_i` indicates the number of previous occurrences of the character at position `i` in the original string. By using the list `s` to keep track of how many times each character has been used, the program correctly reconstructs a string that matches the given trace.

However, there is a subtle issue in the program:
- The program uses `s[j]` to determine which character to append, but `j` is the value from the trace array, not the index in the trace array. This means the program does not correctly map the trace array to the final string.
- Instead, the program should use an index `i` to iterate over the trace array and use `array[i]` to determine which character to append.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        s = [0 for i in range(l)]
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = ''
        for i, j in enumerate(array):
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        print(ans)
```

Since the original program does not correctly map the trace array to the final string, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
