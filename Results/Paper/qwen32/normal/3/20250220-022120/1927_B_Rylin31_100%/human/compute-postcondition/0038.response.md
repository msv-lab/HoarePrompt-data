The code snippet provided is:
```
ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
```
This line of code appends a character to the string `ans`. The character is determined by converting the integer value of `s[j] + 97` to its corresponding ASCII character using the `chr` function.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1
- `l` is the new input integer
- `s` is a list of `l` zeros
- `array` must have at least one element
- `ans` is an empty string
- `i` is `i + 1`

The variable `j` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume `j` is a valid index for the list `s`. Since `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `s[j]` will be `0` for any valid `j`.

Thus, `chr(s[j] + 97)` translates to `chr(0 + 97)`, which is `chr(97)`. The ASCII character for `97` is `'a'`.

Therefore, `ans` will now be `'a'`.

The values of `t`, `l`, `s`, `array`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` must have at least one element, `ans` is `'a'`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
