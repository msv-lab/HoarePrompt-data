In this task, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop based on the provided state at the end of the previous iteration. The loop head only involves the variable `i` and the range `int(input())`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these variables.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in `array`.

The loop statement:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop statement, we understand that the loop will iterate based on the value of `int(input())`. Let's denote the value of `int(input())` as `N`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been `N-1` for the loop to have ended. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `N`.

Thus, the only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in `array`, `i` is the value of `int(input())`**

However, to be more precise, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value. If at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `N-1`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` should be `N`.

Therefore, the final state should reflect this increment:

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Since we don't have the exact previous value of `i` other than it being `N-1` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize:

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in `array`, `i` is the next integer in the sequence of the loop**.

To be specific, if `i` was `N-1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, which means `i` is now `N`**.

Since `N` is `int(input())`, we can denote it as:

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, which means `i` is now `int(input())`**.

However, to be more clear and specific about the increment:

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Given the previous value of `i` was `N-1`, now `i` is `N`:

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, which means `i` is now `N`**.

Given the previous value of `i` was `N-1`, now `i` is `N`:

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, which means `i` is now `N`**.
