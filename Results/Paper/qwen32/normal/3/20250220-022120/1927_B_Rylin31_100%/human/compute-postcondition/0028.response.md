The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` modifies the variable `ans` by appending a character based on the value of `s[j]`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially 'aa' if `s[j]` was 0, or 'ab' if `s[j]` was 1. The value of `chr(s[j] + 97)` will be 'a' if `s[j]` is 0 and 'b' if `s[j]` is 1. Therefore, if `s[j]` was 0, `ans` will become 'aaa', and if `s[j]` was 1, `ans` will become 'abb'.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` is either 1 or 2, `array` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the next element in `array`, `ans` is 'aaa' if `s[j]` was 0, 'abb' if `s[j]` was 1**.
