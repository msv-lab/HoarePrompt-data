The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is used in the `range(int(input()))` function. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which corresponds to the variable `t` in the state description.

Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The value of `i` will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts, as it is typical behavior for a `for` loop with `range`.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The values of `n` and `a` are not directly relevant to the execution of this specific `for` loop, as they are used in the context of the loop body, which is omitted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

Since the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, we can specify the minimum value for `t` to ensure execution:

State: **`t` is 1**
