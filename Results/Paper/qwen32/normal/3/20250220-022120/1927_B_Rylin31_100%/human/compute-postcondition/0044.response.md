The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` modifies the variable `ans` by appending a character to it. Given that `s[j]` is 2 (as per the initial state), the character appended to `ans` will be `chr(2 + 97)`, which is `chr(99)`, or `'c'`. Therefore, `ans` will change from either `'aa'` or `'ab'` to either `'aac'` or `'abc'`.

The other variables (`t`, `l`, `s`, `array`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 2, `array` must have more than one element, `ans` is either `'aac'` or `'abc'`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is the next element in `array`**.
