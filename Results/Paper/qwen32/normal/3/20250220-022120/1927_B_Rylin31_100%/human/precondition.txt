test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the lost string, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid string s exists.
