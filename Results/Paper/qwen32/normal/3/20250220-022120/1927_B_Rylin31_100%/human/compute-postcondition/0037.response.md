The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is an element from the list `array`. Therefore, the state of `array` is the only one we can adjust to ensure the loop executes. If `array` has at least one element, the loop will execute.

Hereâ€™s how we can adjust the state:

- `t` is 1: This does not affect the loop execution.
- `l` is the new input integer: This does not affect the loop execution.
- `s` is a list of `l` zeros: This does not affect the loop execution.
- `array` is a new list of integers obtained from the input: This needs to have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `ans` is an empty string: This does not affect the loop execution.
- `i` is `i + 1`: This does not affect the loop execution.

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` must have at least one element, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`**
