Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), representing the size of the array a. The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    *inp, = map(int, input().split())
    x = y = n + 1
    ans = 0
    for a in inp:
        if a <= x:
            x = a
        elif a <= y:
            y = a
        else:
            x == y
            y = a
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp`, `ans` is the number of times an element was greater than both `x` and `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp`, `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`, `n` is unchanged, `inp` is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is the smallest number in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest number in `inp` or `n + 1` if all numbers are the same or if there is only one number, and `ans` is the count of numbers in `inp` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest numbers encountered.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
