The only variable in the loop head is `a`, which is the loop variable that iterates over the elements of the list `inp`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `a` to the next element in the list `inp`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` is `n + 1`.
- `y` is `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is `a`.
- `ans` is `0` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` or if `a` is less than or equal to the original `y`, otherwise `ans` is `1`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element.

At the start of the next iteration, `a` should be the next element in the list `inp`. Since we do not know the current index of `a` in `inp` from the given state, we can denote the next element as `inp[i+1]` where `i` is the current index of `a` in `inp`. However, for the purpose of this task, we will denote the next element simply as the next value in `inp` without specifying the index.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` is `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is `a`, `ans` is `0` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` or if `a` is less than or equal to the original `y`, otherwise `ans` is `1`, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element**

Since the question specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we only adjust `a` to the next element in `inp`.

State: **`a` is the next element in `inp`**
