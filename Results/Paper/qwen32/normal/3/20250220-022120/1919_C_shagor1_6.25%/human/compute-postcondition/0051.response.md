Postcondition: **`x` is `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` is `n + 1`. `y` is `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is `a`. `ans` is `0` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` or if `a` is less than or equal to the original `y`, otherwise `ans` is `1`. `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element.**
