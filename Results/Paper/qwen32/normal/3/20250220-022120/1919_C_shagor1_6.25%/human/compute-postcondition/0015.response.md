Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `inp` is a tuple of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, `a` is greater than `x`, and if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, the current value of `a` is less than or equal to `y`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.**
