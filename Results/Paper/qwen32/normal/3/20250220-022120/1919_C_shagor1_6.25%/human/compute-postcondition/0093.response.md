Postcondition: **`a` is the next element in `inp`, `y` is the next element in `inp`, `n` retains its previous value, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `x` and `ans` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `x` retains its previous value and `ans` is incremented by 1.**
