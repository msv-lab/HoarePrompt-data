Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `inp` is a tuple of integers that must have at least 2 elements. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, `x` is updated to `a` and `ans` remains 0 if it was already 0. If `a` is greater than `x`, `ans` is set to 1, `x` is updated to `a`, and `y` is updated to `a`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y` and `ans` is 0, `y` is updated to `a`. If `a` is greater than `y`, `ans` is set to 1, `x` is updated to `a`, and `y` is updated to `a`.**
