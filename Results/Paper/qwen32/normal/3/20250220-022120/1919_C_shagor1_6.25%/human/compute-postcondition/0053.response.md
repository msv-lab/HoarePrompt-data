The value of `x` is assigned the value of `a`, which is the next element in `inp`. Therefore, `x` now holds the value of `a`. The other variable `a` remains unchanged as it still refers to the next element in `inp`.

Output State: **`a` is the next element in `inp`; `x` is the next element in `inp`**.
