In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range based on the input integer `n`. The loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute `n` times, corresponding to the number of test cases.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The variables in the loop head are `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is the result of `int(input())`, which should be `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be a positive integer. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that the input to `int(input())` is a positive integer.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5)**

This ensures that the loop will execute `n` times as intended.
