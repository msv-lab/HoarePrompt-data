Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 3. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n-1` with the last element decremented by 1 and `answer` is a list containing `n`. Otherwise, `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n` with the first element being `2` and `answer` contains the element 1.**
