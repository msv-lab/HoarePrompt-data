You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates and prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` in a specific order: starting with 1, then `n`, then 2, then `n-1`, and so on, alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers until all numbers are included in the sequence.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem of generating a k-level permutation for each test case.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem requires constructing a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous subarrays of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Array Construction:**
   - It initializes an array `array` containing integers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Answer Construction:**
   - The `answer` list is initialized with the first element set to 1.
   - A helper list `a` is initialized with `[1, -1]`.

4. **Loop through the permutation:**
   - The program iterates from 1 to `n-1` to fill the `answer` list.
   - The logic to fill the `answer` list is based on the parity of the index `i`:
     - If `i` is odd (`(-1) ** i == -1`), it appends the value from `array[a[-1]]` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - If `i` is even (`(-1) ** i == 1`), it appends the value from `array[a[0]]` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.

5. **Output:**
   - The constructed `answer` list is printed for each test case.

### Evaluation:

The program uses a specific pattern to construct the permutation, but it does not guarantee that the sums of all continuous subarrays of length `k` will differ by no more than 1. The pattern used seems to be alternating between taking elements from the start and end of the `array`, but this does not necessarily ensure the required property for all values of `k` and `n`.

### Example Test Case:

Let's consider the test case `n = 10, k = 4`:

- The program would generate a permutation like `[1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 6]`.
- The sums of subarrays of length 4 would be: `[22, 30, 24, 28, 24, 22]`.
- The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `30 - 22 = 8`, which is not allowed.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
