Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `answer` contains the integer 3. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, then `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n-1` with the last element decremented by 1. Otherwise, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` with the first element being 2.**
