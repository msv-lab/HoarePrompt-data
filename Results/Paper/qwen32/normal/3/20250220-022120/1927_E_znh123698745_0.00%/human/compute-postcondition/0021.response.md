The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` modifies the last element of the list `array` by subtracting 1 from it. Given the initial state, the last element of `array` is `n - 1`. After the operation, the last element becomes `n - 2`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive with the last element set to `n - 2`; `i` is 1; `answer` is a list containing the integers `n` and `1`.**
