The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to `n`, but since the range is up to `n-1`, the loop will not execute again after `i` is `n-1`.

However, to adjust the state for the start of the next iteration (which would be the next valid iteration if the loop were to continue), we increment `i` by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration `i` is `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration (hypothetically, if the loop could continue), `i` would be `n`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is `n`**
