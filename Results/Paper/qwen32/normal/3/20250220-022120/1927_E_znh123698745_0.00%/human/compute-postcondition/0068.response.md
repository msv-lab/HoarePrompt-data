The provided code snippet is `answer.append(array[a[-1]])`. However, there is a typo in the variable name `a[-1]`. It seems like it should be `i` instead of `a[-1]` based on the initial state provided. Assuming the correct code snippet is `answer.append(array[i])`, let's proceed with that.

Given that `i` is 2, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`, and `answer` is presumably an initially empty list or a list that has been defined before this code snippet, the value at index `i` in `array` will be `3` (since `array` is 1-indexed in terms of values but 0-indexed in terms of Python list indexing).

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 2, `answer` contains the value `3`**.
