The code snippet provided attempts to append an element from `array` to the `answer` list. The element to be appended is determined by the last element of `a`. However, the initial state does not provide information about the `a` list or the `array` list. Therefore, we can only describe the effect on `answer` in terms of appending an element from `array` at the index specified by `a[-1]`.

Given that `answer` is initially an integer `3`, it seems there might be a mistake in the initial state description because `answer` should be a list to use the `append` method. Assuming `answer` is actually a list containing the integer `3`, the output state would be:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list containing the integer 3 and an element from `array` at the index `a[-1]`**.
