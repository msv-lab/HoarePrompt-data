The code snippet `a[0] += 1` increments the first element of the list `a` by 1. Initially, `a` is `[1, -1]`, so after the increment, `a[0]` becomes `2`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `answer`, and `array`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1, 2]`, `a` is `[2, -1]`, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`, and `(-1)`**.
