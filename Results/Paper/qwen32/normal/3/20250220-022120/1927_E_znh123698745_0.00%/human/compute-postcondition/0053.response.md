To determine the output of the `print(*answer)` statement, we need to understand the structure and content of the `answer` list based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`answer`** is described as a list with a specific pattern:
   - It starts with `1`.
   - Followed by `n`.
   - Then `2`.
   - Followed by `n-1`.
   - This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the list.
   - The middle elements are `(n+1)//2` and `(n-1)//2 + 1`.

2. **`a`** is defined as `[(n-1)//2 + 1, -n]`, but it is not used in the `print(*answer)` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

### Pattern Explanation:
- The list `answer` alternates between increasing integers starting from 1 and decreasing integers starting from `n`.
- The pattern stops when the two sequences meet in the middle.

### Example:
Let's consider an example with `n = 5` to illustrate the pattern:
- The list `answer` would be: `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`.

### General Case:
For a general `n`, the list `answer` will have the following structure:
- The first half of the list will be `[1, 2, 3, ..., (n+1)//2]`.
- The second half of the list will be `[n, n-1, n-2, ..., (n-1)//2 + 1]`.

### Output:
The `print(*answer)` statement will print all elements of the `answer` list separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
Given the structure of `answer`, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and `n`, alternating and meeting in the middle.

Output: **1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., (n+1)//2, (n-1)//2 + 1**
