The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`, which means the loop has just finished executing. To start the loop again, `i` must be adjusted to the starting value of the range, which is `1`.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be set to `1` to start the next iteration of the loop.

The states of `n`, `k`, `array`, and `answer` are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is 1. If `i` is odd, `array` has its last element set to `n - 1` and `answer` is a list containing the integer `n`. Otherwise, `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[0]]` and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**
