You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. Each test case consists of two integers x and n such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.

    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or whose corresponding pair divisor (i.e., `x // i`) is less than or equal to `n`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n or whose corresponding pair divisor (x // i) is less than or equal to n)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the problem and the logic used in the program.

### Problem Breakdown

The goal is to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems with positive integer difficulties such that the sum of these difficulties equals `x`. The objective is to maximize the balance, defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.

### Key Observations

1. **Divisors and Multiples**: The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties will be a divisor of `x`. This is because any common divisor of the sub-problems' difficulties must also divide their sum, which is `x`.

2. **Feasibility Check**: For a divisor `d` of `x` to be a possible GCD, the number of sub-problems `n` must be such that `x / d` is at least `n`. This is because if `d` is the GCD, then each sub-problem's difficulty can be written as `d * k_i` where `k_i` are positive integers, and the sum of these `k_i` must be `x / d`. For this to be possible, `x / d` must be at least `n`.

### Program Analysis

The program iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:

- It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, `i` could be a possible GCD.
- It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, `x // i` could be a possible GCD.
- It updates the maximum GCD (`ans`) found so far.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.
   - Possible GCDs: 
     - `i = 1`: `x // i = 10` (n <= 10, ans = 1)
     - `i = 2`: `x // i = 5` (n <= 5, ans = 2)
     - `i = 5`: `x // i = 2` (n not <= 2)
     - `i = 10`: `x // i = 1` (n not <= 1)
   - Maximum GCD is 2.

2. **Second Test Case**: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - Divisors of 5 are 1, 5.
   - Possible GCDs:
     - `i = 1`: `x // i = 5` (n <= 5, ans = 1)
     - `i = 5`: `x // i = 1` (n not <= 1)
   - Maximum GCD is 1.

3. **Third Test Case**: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - Divisors of 420 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420.
   - Possible GCDs:
     - `i = 6`: `x // i = 70` (n <= 70, ans = 6)
     - Other divisors do not provide a higher GCD.
   - Maximum GCD is 6.

### Conclusion

The program correctly finds the maximum possible GCD for each test case based on the logic described above. Therefore, the program is correct.
