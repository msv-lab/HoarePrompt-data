Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `i` is a divisor of `x` such that `x % i == 0` and `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and both `x // i` and `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
