To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the range it iterates over, specifically `isqrt(x) + 1`. 

The loop will execute if the range `isqrt(x) + 1` is greater than 1, meaning `isqrt(x)` must be at least 1. The `isqrt(x)` function returns the integer square root of `x`, which is the greatest integer `y` such that `y^2 <= x`.

Given the constraints:
- `1 <= n <= x <= 10^8`
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`
- `ans` is 0

The value of `x` is at least 1, and therefore `isqrt(x)` is at least 1. This means `isqrt(x) + 1` is at least 2, ensuring the loop will execute at least once.

Since `i` is the loop variable and starts at 1, we don't need to adjust its initial value. The variables `t`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `ans` is 0**
