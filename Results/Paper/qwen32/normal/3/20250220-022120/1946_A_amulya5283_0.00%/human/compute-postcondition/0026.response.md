The code snippet calculates the median index of the array `arr` by performing integer division of `n` by 2. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged except for the addition of `median_index`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is 4; `n` is the first element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the second element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`.**
