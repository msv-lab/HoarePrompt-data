The `heapq.heapify(heap)` function transforms the list `heap` into a heap in-place, meaning the list `heap` will now satisfy the heap property. This operation does not change the values of the elements in `heap`, but it does change their order to ensure the heap property is maintained. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, `operations` is the total number of increments performed to achieve the initial state, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`.**

In natural language: The list `heap` is now a heapified version of its initial state, while all other variables retain their original values.
