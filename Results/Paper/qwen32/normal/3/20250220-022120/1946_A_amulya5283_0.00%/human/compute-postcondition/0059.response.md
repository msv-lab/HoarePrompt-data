The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` into the heap. The heap property is maintained after this operation.

Here's the impact on the variables:
- `heap`: The heap now contains the value `smallest + 1` and is still heapified.
- Other variables (`operations`, `results`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `smallest`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 1, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`, `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the operation.**
