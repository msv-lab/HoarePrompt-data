To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop condition: `heap[0]` and `current_median`.

The loop condition is:
```
while heap[0] <= current_median:
```
This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added.
- `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`.

Since `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in that subarray. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that this smallest element is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Let's break it down:
- `current_median` is the median of the array `arr`, which is `arr[n // 2]`.
- `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `heap[0]` should be less than or equal to `current_median`. If `heap[0]` is already less than or equal to `current_median`, no adjustment is needed. If `heap[0]` is greater than `current_median`, we need to adjust `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`.

However, we are only allowed to adjust `heap[0]` and `current_median` directly. Since `current_median` is derived from `arr[n // 2]`, adjusting `current_median` directly might not be straightforward without changing `arr` or `n`, which are not allowed to be adjusted.

Therefore, the most straightforward adjustment would be to ensure `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. If `heap[0]` is greater than `current_median`, we can adjust `heap[0]` to be `current_median` or any value less than `current_median`.

State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added, `operations` is 1, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`**
