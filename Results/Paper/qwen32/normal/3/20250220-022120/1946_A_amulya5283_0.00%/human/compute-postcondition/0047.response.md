The code snippet provided sorts the array `arr`. This operation affects only the `arr` variable, rearranging its elements in ascending order. The other variables (`heap`, `operations`, `results`, `i`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains elements all greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of increments performed to achieve this state, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order.**
