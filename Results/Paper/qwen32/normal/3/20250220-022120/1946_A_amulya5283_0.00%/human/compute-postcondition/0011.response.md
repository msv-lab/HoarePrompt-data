The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` onto the heap. This operation modifies the `heap` by adding the new element, but it does not affect any other variables directly.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with one less element and now includes `smallest + 1`; `operations` is 0; `smallest` is the smallest element that was in the heap.**

In natural language: The heap now includes an additional element which is `smallest + 1`, where `smallest` was the smallest element in the heap before the operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
