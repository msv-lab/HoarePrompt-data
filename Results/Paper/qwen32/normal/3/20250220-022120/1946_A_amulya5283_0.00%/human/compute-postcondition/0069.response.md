Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`. The function returns `results`, which is a list containing the total number of operations for each test case.**
