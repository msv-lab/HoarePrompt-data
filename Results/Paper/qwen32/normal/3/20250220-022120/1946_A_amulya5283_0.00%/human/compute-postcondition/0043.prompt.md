Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is 4; `n` is the first element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the second element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of `arr`; `operations` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while heap[0] <= current_median:
    smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
    heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`; `heap` has the same number of elements as before, with the heap property restored, and includes the value `smallest + 1`; `operations` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `smallest` is the new smallest element from `heap`; `heap` has one more element, `smallest + 1`, and the heap property is restored; `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`; `operations` is incremented by 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `smallest` is `smallest + 1`; `heap` has one more element, `smallest + 1`; the heap property is restored; `current_median` must be less than or equal to `smallest`; `operations` is incremented by 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
