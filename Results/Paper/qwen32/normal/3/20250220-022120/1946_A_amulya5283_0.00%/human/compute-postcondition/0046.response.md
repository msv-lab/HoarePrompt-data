The code snippet assigns the values from the tuple `test_cases[i]` to the variables `n` and `arr`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, the specific values of `n` and `arr` will depend on the content of `test_cases` at index `k + 1`. However, the state of other variables (`heap`, `operations`, `results`, and `t`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains elements all greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of increments performed to achieve this state, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]`.**
