The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` onto the heap. This modifies the heap, but it does not affect the values of other variables such as `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, or `operations`. The value of `smallest` remains unchanged as it is not reassigned in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with one less element and now includes the next smallest element after the popped one plus one; `operations` is 1; `smallest` is the smallest element that was at the root of the heap.`**
