To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition: `heap[0]` and `current_median`.

The loop condition is `while heap[0] <= current_median:`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the state:
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`.
- `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `heap[0]` or `current_median` such that `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Since `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap and it has been adjusted to `smallest + 1`, we need to ensure that `smallest + 1` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `current_median` to be greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`.

State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 2, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the operation.**
