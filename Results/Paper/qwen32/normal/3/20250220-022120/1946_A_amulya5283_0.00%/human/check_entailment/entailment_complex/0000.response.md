### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array by incrementing any element by 1. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of integers.
   - It then iterates over the number of test cases and parses each test case to extract the array length `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted.
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`.
   - The current median is determined as `arr[median_index]`.
   - A heap is created from the elements of the array starting from the median index (`arr[median_index:]`).
   - The heap is then heapified to allow efficient retrieval of the smallest element.

3. **Calculating Operations**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as the smallest element in the heap (`heap[0]`) is less than or equal to the current median.
   - In each iteration of the loop, the smallest element is popped from the heap, incremented by 1, and then pushed back into the heap.
   - The operation count is incremented by 1 for each such operation.
   - The loop terminates when the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median, indicating that the median has been increased.

4. **Result Compilation**:
   - The number of operations for each test case is appended to the `results` list.
   - Finally, the `results` list is returned, containing the number of operations for each test case.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here are the key points that support the correctness:

- **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily identify the median.
- **Heap Usage**: The heap is used to efficiently find and modify the smallest element from the median position onward.
- **Loop Condition**: The loop condition ensures that operations are performed only until the median is increased.
- **Operation Count**: The operation count is correctly incremented for each modification.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should correctly compute the minimum number of operations required for each test case.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
