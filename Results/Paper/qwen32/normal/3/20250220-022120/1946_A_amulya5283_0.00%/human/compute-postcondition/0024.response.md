The code snippet assigns the value of the 5th element (since `i` is 4 and list indices start at 0) of `test_cases` to the variables `n` and `arr`. This means `n` will hold the first element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` will hold the second element, which is a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is 4; `n` is the first element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the second element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases`.**
