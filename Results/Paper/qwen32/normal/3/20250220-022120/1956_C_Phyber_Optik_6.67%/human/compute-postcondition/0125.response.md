The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces. Given the initial state, `n` is 5. Therefore, the `range(1, n + 1)` generates numbers from 1 to 5.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. `n` is 5.
2. `range(1, n + 1)` translates to `range(1, 6)`, which generates the sequence of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
3. The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the sequence and prints each number separated by a space.

Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
