The value of `r` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state specifies that `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has already been incremented by 1 from its previous value. The value of `n` being greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `i + 1`**.
