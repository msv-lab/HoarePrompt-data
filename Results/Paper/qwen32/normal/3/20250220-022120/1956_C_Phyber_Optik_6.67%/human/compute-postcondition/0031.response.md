To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + r + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sum` is 75
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 0
- `j` is either less than or equal to 0 or greater than 0

We need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute one more time. The loop will execute if `j` is within the range `[1, n + r + 1)`. Since `n` is 0 and `r` is 2, the range becomes `[1, 3)`.

Let's analyze the possible values of `j`:
- If `j` is less than or equal to 0, it is not within the range `[1, 3)`, so the loop will not execute.
- If `j` is greater than 0, it must be within the range `[1, 3)` for the loop to execute.

Since the loop has just finished an iteration, `j` must have been within the range `[1, 3)` at the start of that iteration. After the loop body executes, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the next value in the range `[1, 3)`.

Given the current state, if `j` was 1 at the start of the last iteration, it would have been incremented to 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`sum` is 75, `r` is 2, `n` is 0, `j` is 1**
