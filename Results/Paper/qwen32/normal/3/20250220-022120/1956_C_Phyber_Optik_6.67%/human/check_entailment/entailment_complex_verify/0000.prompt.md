You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

    #Given the above analysis, the final output state after all iterations is:
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, it calculates and prints a sum and a value `n + r`, followed by a series of lines describing operations on the matrix. The final state of the program after processing all test cases is the output of the calculated sums, values, and matrix operations for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix using the allowed operations. Let's analyze the program and the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
- Two types of operations are allowed:
  1. Assign \( a_{i, j} = p_j \) for all \( 1 \leq j \leq n \) where \( p \) is a permutation of \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
  2. Assign \( a_{j, i} = p_j \) for all \( 1 \leq j \leq n \) where \( p \) is a permutation of \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to be attempting to calculate the maximum sum and the number of operations, but the logic is flawed and does not correctly implement the operations to achieve the maximum sum.

- The program calculates the sum and the number of operations in a way that does not guarantee the maximum possible sum.
- The operations described in the output do not necessarily maximize the sum.

#### Example to Demonstrate Incorrectness:
Let's consider the case when \( n = 2 \):

**Expected Output:**
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The maximum sum is 7, which can be achieved by setting the matrix as follows:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  1 & 2
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- The operations are:
  1. Set the first row to [1, 2].
  2. Set the second row to [1, 2].
  3. Set the first column to [1, 1].

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```

While the output for \( n = 2 \) happens to be correct, the program does not guarantee the correct output for all values of \( n \). Specifically, the logic used to calculate the sum and the operations is not robust and does not follow a clear strategy to maximize the sum.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum for all possible values of \( n \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
