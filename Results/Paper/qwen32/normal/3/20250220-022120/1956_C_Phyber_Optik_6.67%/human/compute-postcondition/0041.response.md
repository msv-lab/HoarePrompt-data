Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `sum` is 75
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 0
- `j` is 2

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

We need to analyze the `range(1, n + 1)` expression:
- `n` is 0, so `n + 1` equals 1.
- `range(1, 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, 1. This means the range is empty.

The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks the range, but since the range is empty, there are no values to unpack and print.

Thus, the `print` statement will not print anything.

Output: **(nothing)**
