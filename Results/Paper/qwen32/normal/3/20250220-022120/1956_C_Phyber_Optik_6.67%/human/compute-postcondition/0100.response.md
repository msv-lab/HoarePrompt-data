To determine the Output State, we need to evaluate the expression `sum += i * n` based on the given Initial State conditions.

Given:
- `sum` is either `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, or `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.
- `r` is `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, or `0` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is 2.
- `j` is 8.
- `i` is 4.

The code snippet is:
```
sum += i * n
```

Let's break down the possible scenarios for `sum` and `r`:

1. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`:
   - `sum` is initially `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - `r` is initially `i`.
   - After executing `sum += i * n`, `sum` becomes `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n`.

2. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`:
   - `sum` is initially `i * n`.
   - `r` is initially `0`.
   - After executing `sum += i * n`, `sum` becomes `i * n + i * n = 2 * i * n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we need to express the output state in terms of `n`.

Output State: **`sum` is either `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `2 * i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`; `r` is `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `0` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `t` is 2; `j` is 8; `i` is 4.**
