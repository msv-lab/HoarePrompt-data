The code snippet `r = i` sets the value of `r` to the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 4, `r` will be set to 4. The values of the other variables (`sum`, `n`, `t`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum` is either `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, or `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`; `r` is 4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `t` is 2; `j` is 8; `i` is 4.**
