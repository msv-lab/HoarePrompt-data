Let's analyze the program and its behavior based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

### Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum based on the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` for the first `r` rows and `i * n` for the remaining rows.
   - This calculation is intended to maximize the sum of the matrix. However, the logic seems flawed.
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. This is the maximum sum possible for a single row if we use all numbers from 1 to n exactly once.
   - For the sum calculation, the program is supposed to maximize the sum of the matrix by filling it with permutations of numbers from 1 to n.
   - The correct sum for an `n x n` matrix filled with permutations of numbers from 1 to n would be `n * n * (n + 1) // 2`. This is because each row and each column is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, and there are `n` rows and `n` columns.

2. **Number of Operations:**
   - The program outputs `n + r` operations, where `r` is determined based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - The problem specifies that the number of operations should not exceed `2n`, and the program adheres to this constraint.

3. **Operations Description:**
   - The program outputs operations to fill the matrix.
   - For the first `n` operations, it fills the rows with permutations from 1 to n.
   - For the remaining operations (if any), it fills the columns with permutations from 1 to n.
   - This ensures that the matrix is filled with permutations, which is the goal.

### Correctness:

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix. The issue lies in the sum calculation logic. The correct maximum sum for an `n x n` matrix filled with permutations of numbers from 1 to n is `n * n * (n + 1) // 2`, not the sum calculated by the program.

However, the operations described by the program are correct in terms of filling the matrix with permutations, and the number of operations does not exceed `2n`.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic for operations is correct, but the sum calculation is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct according to the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**
