The code snippet `sum += i * n` modifies the value of the variable `sum` by adding the product of `i` and `n` to it. The values of `i` and `n` are not changed by this operation.

Given that `i` is `i + 1`, this means `i` is incremented by 1 before the operation. However, the initial state description seems to have a typo or misunderstanding, as `i` cannot be `i + 1` in the usual sense of variable assignment. Assuming `i` is some value and the statement is meant to indicate that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line (which is not shown in the provided code), we proceed with the calculation.

The value of `sum` is updated to `sum + (i * n)`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the new value of `sum` will be the previous value of `sum` plus a value that is at least `i`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is updated to `sum + (i * n)`**.
