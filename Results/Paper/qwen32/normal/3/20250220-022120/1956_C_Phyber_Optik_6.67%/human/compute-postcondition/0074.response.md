To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `j` in the `for j in range(1, n + r + 1)` statement.

Here's the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `sum` is 110, `r` is 1, `n` is 5, `t` is 1, and `j` is either less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5.

The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + r + 1`. Given `n` is 5 and `r` is 1, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 7 (5 + 1 + 1).

Since `j` is either less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `j` to the next value for the loop to potentially execute again. If `j` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 6 at the start of the next iteration.

The other variables (`sum`, `r`, `n`, `t`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`sum` is 110, `r` is 1, `n` is 5, `t` is 1, `j` is 6**
