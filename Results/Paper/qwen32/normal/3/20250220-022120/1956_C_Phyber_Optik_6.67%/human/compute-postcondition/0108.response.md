To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to evaluate the expressions based on the initial state provided:

1. `sum` is explicitly given as 90.
2. `n` is explicitly given as 5.
3. `r` is explicitly given as 2.
4. The expression `n + r` needs to be evaluated using the values of `n` and `r`.

Let's evaluate the expression `n + r`:
- `n` is 5.
- `r` is 2.
- Therefore, `n + r` is `5 + 2`, which equals 7.

Now, we can determine the output of the `print` statement:
- The first value to be printed is `sum`, which is 90.
- The second value to be printed is `n + r`, which is 7.

Putting this together, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **90, 7**
