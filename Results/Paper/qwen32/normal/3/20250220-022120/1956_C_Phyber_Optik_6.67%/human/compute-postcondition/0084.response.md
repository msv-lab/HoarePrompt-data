To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the `range` function within the context of the provided initial state.

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 up to `n + 1` (not inclusive).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is 5.

The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers from 1 to `n + 1`, which is 1 to 6 (not inclusive of 6).

Thus, the sequence generated by `range(1, 6)` is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks this sequence, so each number will be printed separated by a space.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the numbers 1 through 5, each separated by a space.

Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
