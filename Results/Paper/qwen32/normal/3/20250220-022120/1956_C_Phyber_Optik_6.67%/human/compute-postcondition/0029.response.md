To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state of the variables and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `sum` is 75
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 0
- `j` is greater than `n`

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n + 1`.
- Given that `n` is 0, `n + 1` equals 1.
- Therefore, `range(1, 1)` generates an empty sequence because the start value (1) is equal to the stop value (1), and the sequence does not include the stop value.

The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks the sequence generated by `range`. Since the sequence is empty, nothing will be printed.

Output: **(nothing)**
