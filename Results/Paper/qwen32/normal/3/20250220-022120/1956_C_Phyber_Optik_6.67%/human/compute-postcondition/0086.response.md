To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop works and how the variable `j` changes throughout the iterations.

The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + r + 1`, which in this case is `j = 1` to `j = 5 + 1 + 1 = 7`.

Let's break down the loop iterations:

1. **Iteration 1 (j = 1)**: Since `j <= n` (1 <= 5), the loop prints `1 1` followed by the numbers from 1 to 5.
2. **Iteration 2 (j = 2)**: Since `j <= n` (2 <= 5), the loop prints `1 2` followed by the numbers from 1 to 5.
3. **Iteration 3 (j = 3)**: Since `j <= n` (3 <= 5), the loop prints `1 3` followed by the numbers from 1 to 5.
4. **Iteration 4 (j = 4)**: Since `j <= n` (4 <= 5), the loop prints `1 4` followed by the numbers from 1 to 5.
5. **Iteration 5 (j = 5)**: Since `j <= n` (5 <= 5), the loop prints `1 5` followed by the numbers from 1 to 5.
6. **Iteration 6 (j = 6)**: Since `j > n` (6 > 5), the loop prints `2 1` (since `j % n` is `6 % 5 = 1`) followed by the numbers from 1 to 5.
7. **Iteration 7 (j = 7)**: Since `j > n` (7 > 5), the loop prints `2 2` (since `j % n` is `7 % 5 = 2`) followed by the numbers from 1 to 5.

After these iterations, the loop ends, and the values of `sum`, `r`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged. The variable `j` will be 8 after the loop ends, as it has incremented through all values from 1 to 7.

Output State: **sum is 110, r is 1, n is 5, t is 1, j is 8.**

In natural language: The final state after all iterations of the loop is that `sum` remains 110, `r` remains 1, `n` remains 5, `t` remains 1, and `j` is 8 since it has completed all iterations from 1 to 7.
