The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

The states `sum`, `r`, `t`, and `j` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`sum` is either `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `2 * i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`. `r` is 4 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `0` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`. `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. `t` is 2. `j` is 8. `i` is 5**
