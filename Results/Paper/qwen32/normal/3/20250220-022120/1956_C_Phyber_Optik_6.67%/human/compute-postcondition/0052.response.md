The value of `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to it. The values of `r`, `n`, `t`, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2` being less than or equal to `i * n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 1, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**
