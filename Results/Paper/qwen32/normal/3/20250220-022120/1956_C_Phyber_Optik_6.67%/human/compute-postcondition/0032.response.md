The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the values of the variables and constants involved:

- `1` is a literal integer value.
- `j` is a variable with an explicit value of `1` as given in the initial state.
- `end=' '` specifies that the output should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

Combining these, the `print` statement will output the value `1`, followed by the value of `j` (which is `1`), and then a space.

Output: **1 1 **
