The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print(1, j, end=' ')`. Let's break down the components:

- The first argument to `print` is the integer `1`.
- The second argument to `print` is the variable `j`.
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that the print statement should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

From the initial state, we know that `j` is 3. Therefore, the `print` statement will output the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j` which is `3`, and then a space due to the `end=' '` argument.

Output: **1 3 **
