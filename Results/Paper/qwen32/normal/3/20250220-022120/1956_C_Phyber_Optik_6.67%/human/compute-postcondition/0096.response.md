Postcondition: **`sum` is either `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, or `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`. `r` is `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, or `0` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`. `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, and `j` is 8.**
