Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is 75
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 0
- `j` is 1

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n + 1`.
- Given `n` is 0, `n + 1` equals 1.
- Therefore, `range(1, 1)` generates an empty sequence because the start value (1) is not less than the stop value (1).

### What Will Be Printed:
- The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)`.
- Since `range(1, 1)` is an empty sequence, there are no values to unpack and print.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output nothing because the range is empty.

Output: **(nothing)**
