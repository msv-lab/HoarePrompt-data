The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current value, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than or equal to `n`.

Let's break down the conditions and the state adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current value, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The loop will execute again if `i + 1 <= n`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to `i + 1` and ensure that `n` remains the same.

State: **`sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `(i + 1) * n`; otherwise, `sum` is `(i + 1) * n`. `r` is `i + 1` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `(i + 1) * n`; otherwise, `r` is 0. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `t` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, since only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we only need to adjust `i`.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
