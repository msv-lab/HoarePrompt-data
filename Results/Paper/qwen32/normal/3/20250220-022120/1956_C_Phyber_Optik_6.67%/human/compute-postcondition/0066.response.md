The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `n` and `r`. The loop will execute if `n + r + 1` is greater than 1, since the range starts from 1.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `sum` is 110
- `r` is 1
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 1

We need to ensure that the loop can execute by making sure `n + r + 1` is greater than 1. With the current values, `n + r + 1` equals 7, which is greater than 1, so no adjustment is needed for `n` and `r` to ensure the loop executes.

Since `j` is the loop variable and is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop, we don't need to adjust it before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts remains as:
State: **`sum` is 110, `r` is 1, `n` is 5, `t` is 1**
