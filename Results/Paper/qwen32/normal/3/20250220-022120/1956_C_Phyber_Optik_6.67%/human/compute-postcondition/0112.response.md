The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print all the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Given that `n` is 5, the range will be from 1 to 5.

Let's break it down:
- `n` is 5.
- `range(1, n + 1)` translates to `range(1, 6)`, which generates numbers from 1 to 5.
- The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the range, meaning it will print each number in the range separated by spaces.

So, the numbers 1 through 5 will be printed on the same line, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
