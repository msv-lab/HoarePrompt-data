To determine what will be printed by the `print(minn)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables are defined and related to each other.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers
- `i` is `len(ar)`
- `num` is the last element of `ar`
- `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`
- `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list
- `minn` is not equal to infinity

Let's break down the variables and their relationships:
1. `ar` is a list of integers.
2. `num` is the last element of `ar`, i.e., `num = ar[-1]`.
3. `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list `ar`. This means `same` is the number of times `num` appears consecutively from the end of the list.
4. `minn` is the minimum value between the previous value of `minn` and `same`.

Since the exact list `ar` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `num` and `same`. However, we can describe the value of `minn` based on the given information.

The value of `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element `num` at the end of the list `ar`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(minn)` statement will be the value of `minn`, which is the minimum of its previous value and `same`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum of its previous value and the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element of `ar` at the end of the list `ar`)**
