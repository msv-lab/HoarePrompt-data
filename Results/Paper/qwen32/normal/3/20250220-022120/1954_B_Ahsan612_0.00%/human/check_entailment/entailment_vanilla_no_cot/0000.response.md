Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. While it attempts to find the minimum number of elements that can be removed to make the array not beautiful, the logic is flawed. The program counts the maximum length of consecutive identical elements and then incorrectly assumes that removing the smallest such segment will make the array not beautiful. However, this is not always the case.

For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program will find that the minimum length of consecutive identical elements is 1 (the `5`), but removing the `5` alone does not make the array not beautiful because the remaining array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is still beautiful. The correct answer is to remove three elements to get `[5, 3, 3, 3]` or `[3, 3, 3, 5]`, which are not beautiful.

To correctly solve this problem, the algorithm should consider more complex scenarios, such as checking if removing a segment of elements can break the "beautiful" property of the array. This might involve more sophisticated analysis or a different approach altogether.
