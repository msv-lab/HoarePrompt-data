Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq |a| - 1\)) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \(n\) and a list of integers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\). It then attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the number of consecutive identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity to keep track of the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

2. **Iterating Through the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`, then resets `same` to 1 and updates `num` to the current element.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `minn` with the last counted sequence of identical elements.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means there was no sequence of identical elements, and the program outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic**: The program's logic is incorrect. The variable `minn` is supposed to find the minimum length of sequences of identical elements, but it does not correctly account for all sequences. It only considers sequences that end when a different element is encountered. It does not handle the case where the entire array is a single sequence of identical elements correctly.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where the entire array is a single sequence of identical elements. In such cases, it should output `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
- **Final Update**: The final update of `minn` is necessary, but the logic around it is flawed, as it does not correctly reflect the minimum sequence length in all scenarios.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
