The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of `same` by 1. Given that `same` was initially 1, after executing this line, `same` will be 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input and must have a length greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num` is the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 2.**
