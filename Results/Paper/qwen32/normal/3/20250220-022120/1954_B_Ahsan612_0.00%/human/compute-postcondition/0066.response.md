The value of `same` is incremented by 1. Given that `same` was either 2 or 3, after the increment, `same` will be either 3 or 4. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, and `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 3 or 4**.
