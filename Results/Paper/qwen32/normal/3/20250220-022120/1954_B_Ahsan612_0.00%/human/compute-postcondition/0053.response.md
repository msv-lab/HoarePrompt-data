The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` compares the current value of `minn` with the value of `same` and assigns the smaller value back to `minn`. Initially, `minn` is `inf` (infinity) and `same` is 1. Since 1 is smaller than infinity, `minn` will be updated to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 1. Additionally, `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
