The code snippet provided simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `same`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `same` is updated to `1`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 1.**
