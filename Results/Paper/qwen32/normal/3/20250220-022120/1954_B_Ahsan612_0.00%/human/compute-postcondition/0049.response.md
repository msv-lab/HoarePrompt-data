The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `num` is the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 2. The current element at index `i` in `ar` is equal to `num`.**
