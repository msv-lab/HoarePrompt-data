To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is `while i < len(ar):`, so we need to ensure that the condition `i < len(ar)` remains true.

Here's the given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements
- If `ar[i] == num`, then `i` is 3 or 4, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 1.

From the problem, we know that `ar` has at least 3 elements. The loop will continue as long as `i < len(ar)`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. Since `ar` has at least 3 elements, the length of `ar` is at least 3.

Given that `i` is either 3 or 4 in the provided conditions, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 3 because if `i` is 4 and `ar` has only 3 elements, `i < len(ar)` would be false.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is 3. No other variables in the loop head (`ar`) need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 2 or 3**
