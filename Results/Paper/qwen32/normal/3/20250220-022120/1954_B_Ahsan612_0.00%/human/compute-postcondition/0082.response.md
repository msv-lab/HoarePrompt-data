The code snippet `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reassigns the variable `ar` to a new list of integers obtained from the input. This means the previous value of `ar` is overwritten, and `n` (the input integer) and `i` (which was the length of the previous `ar`) will no longer reflect the state they were in before this assignment. The variables `num`, `minn`, and `same` are derived from the previous state of `ar`, so they will also be affected as they depend on the old `ar`.

After the new assignment, the new `ar` will be a list of integers from the input, `i` will be the length of this new `ar`, `num` will be the last element of this new `ar`, and `minn` and `same` will need to be recalculated based on this new list.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input, `i` is the length of the new `ar`, `num` is the last element of the new `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the new `ar`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the new `ar`.**
