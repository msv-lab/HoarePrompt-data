The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` by reading an integer input from the user. The other variables (`t`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`, and `same`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` retains its value of `inf`, and `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements.**
