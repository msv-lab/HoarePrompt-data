The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1` directly. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`, `same`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the value `-1`.

Here's a breakdown of the variables mentioned in the initial state for clarity:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
- `n`: An input integer.
- `ar`: A list of integers.
- `i`: The length of the list `ar`.
- `num`: The last element of the list `ar`.
- `minn`: Initialized to positive infinity (`inf`).
- `same`: The count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list `ar`.

Since the `print` statement only outputs `-1`, the values of the variables do not affect the printed output.

Output: **-1**
