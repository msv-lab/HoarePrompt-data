The code assigns the value of the element at index `i` of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. Given that `i` is either 4 or 5, `num` will take the value of `ar[4]` if `i` is 4, or `ar[5]` if `i` is 5. The values of `t`, `n`, and `ar` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 4 elements, `i` is either 4 or 5, `num` is `ar[i]`.**
