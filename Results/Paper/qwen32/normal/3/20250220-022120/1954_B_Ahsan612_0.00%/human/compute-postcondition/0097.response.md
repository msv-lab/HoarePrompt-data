The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `ar`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3. The length of `ar` is greater than 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

- If `i` is 2, it can be incremented to 3, and the loop can still execute if the length of `ar` is greater than 3.
- If `i` is 3, it can be incremented to 4, and the loop can still execute if the length of `ar` is greater than 4.

Since the length of `ar` is greater than 1, we need to ensure that `i` is less than the length of `ar` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we can set `i` to a value that is less than the length of `ar`. Given that `i` is currently 2 or 3, we can set `i` to 2 to ensure the loop can execute one more time regardless of the exact length of `ar` (as long as it is greater than 2).

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num` remains the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 2**
