The code snippet `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Given that `i` is 2, `num` is updated to the value of the third element in the list `ar` (since list indices start at 0).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is inf, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

In natural language: The value of `num` is now the value of the third element in the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged.
