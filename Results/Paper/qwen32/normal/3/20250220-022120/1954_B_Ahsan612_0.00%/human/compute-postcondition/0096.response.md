The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, the value of `i` can be either 1 or 2. 

- If `i` was initially 1, after the increment, `i` becomes 2.
- If `i` was initially 2, after the increment, `i` becomes 3.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `same`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 2, `num` remains the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 3, `num` becomes `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 1.**
