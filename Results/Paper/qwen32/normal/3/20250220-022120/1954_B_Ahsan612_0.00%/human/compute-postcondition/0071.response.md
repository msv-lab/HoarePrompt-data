Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements. If `ar[i] == num`, then `i` remains 3, `num` remains either the first or second element of `ar`, `minn` remains either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `i` becomes 4, `num` becomes `ar[4]`, `minn` is the minimum of its initial value and `same`, and `same` becomes 1.**
