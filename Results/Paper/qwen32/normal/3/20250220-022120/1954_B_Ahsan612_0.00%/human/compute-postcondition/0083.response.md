The code snippet provided sets the variable `same` to 1. This changes the value of `same` while all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input, `i` is the length of the new `ar`, `num` is the last element of the new `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the new `ar`, and `same` is 1.**
