Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= |a| - 1`), such that `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`, and replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}`.

### Key Observations:
1. If the array is already composed of identical elements, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer is `-1`.
2. Otherwise, we need to find the smallest group of consecutive identical elements in the array. Removing all but one element from this group will ensure the array is no longer beautiful.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through the array to find the smallest group of consecutive identical elements. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - `num` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf` to keep track of the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements found.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of its current value and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to ensure the last sequence of identical elements is considered.
   - If `minn` remains `inf`, it means there was only one type of element in the array, so it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly identifies the smallest sequence of consecutive identical elements and returns its length as the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. If the array is already composed of identical elements, it correctly returns `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

**Correctness: True**
