The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so after the execution, `i` becomes 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `same` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 2 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 1 or 2**.
