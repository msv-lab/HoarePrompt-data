Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5); `y` is 0; the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the program is executing within the main module, indicated by the condition `__name__ == '__main__'`.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` has decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
