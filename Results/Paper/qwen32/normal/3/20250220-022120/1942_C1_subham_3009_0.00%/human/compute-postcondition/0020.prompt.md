Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5); `y` is 0; the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the program is executing within the main module, indicated by the condition `__name__ == '__main__'`.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    print(x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third integers from the new input, respectively, `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the remaining elements are strings.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is at least 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers from the new input, `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the remaining elements are strings.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
