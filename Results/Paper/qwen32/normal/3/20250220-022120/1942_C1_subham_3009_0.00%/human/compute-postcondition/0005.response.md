The code `arr = input().split()` takes a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `arr`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `arr` is a list of substrings from the second line of input, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
