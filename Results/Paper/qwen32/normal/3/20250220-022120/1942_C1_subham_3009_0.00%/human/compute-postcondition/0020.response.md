Output State: **`t` is 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the last set of integers from the input, `arr` is a list of integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen in the last iteration.**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until `t` becomes 0. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` will hold the values from the last input line processed by the loop. The list `arr` will contain the integers representing the vertices Bessie chose in the final iteration of the loop.
