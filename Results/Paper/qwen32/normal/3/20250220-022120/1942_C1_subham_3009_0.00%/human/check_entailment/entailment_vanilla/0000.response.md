Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding:
- We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
- Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.
- We are not allowed to choose any more vertices (`y = 0`).
- We need to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the `x` vertices.

### Key Observations:
- For `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`.
  - This is a known combinatorial result: for a set of `x` points on a convex polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting diagonals that can be drawn is `x - 3`, which divides the polygon into `x - 2` triangles.
- Since `y = 0`, we cannot add any more vertices, so the number of vertices remains `x`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
- It reads the list of `x` vertices.
- The program then prints `x - 2` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly computes the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the `x` vertices, which is `x - 2`.
- Since `y = 0`, the program does not need to consider any additional vertices, and its output is correct for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
