Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply outputs `x - 2` for each test case, which is not the correct approach to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the vertices chosen by Bessie and determine how many non-intersecting triangles can be formed using those vertices. Since `y = 0`, we cannot add any more vertices. The strategy involves checking the arrangement of the chosen vertices and counting the number of triangles that can be formed without any intersections.

Here is a more correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Sort the vertices chosen by Bessie.
2. Iterate through the sorted vertices and count the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed.

The correct implementation would be more complex than the provided program and would involve checking the gaps between the chosen vertices to determine the number of triangles.

Given the provided program's simplicity and the fact that it does not follow the logic required to solve the problem, the correctness is **False**.
