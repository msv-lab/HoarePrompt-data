### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by drawing diagonals between vertices of a regular polygon, given that Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices and `y` is 0 (meaning no additional vertices can be chosen).

The key insight here is that each additional diagonal can potentially form more triangles. However, the problem simplifies because `y = 0`, meaning no more vertices can be chosen. Therefore, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is solely dependent on the `x` vertices Bessie has already chosen.

For `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`. This is because you can always form a triangle with 3 vertices, and each additional vertex can add one more triangle by connecting to two existing vertices in a non-intersecting manner.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by reading the input values, and for each test case, it outputs `x - 2`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with the given `x` vertices.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
