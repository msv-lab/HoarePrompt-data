Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The value of `k` is not a power of 2, and `k` is even.**
