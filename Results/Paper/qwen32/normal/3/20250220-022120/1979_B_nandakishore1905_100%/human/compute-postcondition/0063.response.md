To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions described.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the `print(k)` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. **`i`**: The current iteration number + 2. This variable is also not directly used in the `print(k)` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
3. **`n` and `m`**: These are integers read from the input.
4. **`k`**: The absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \( k = |n - m| \).
5. **Additional Conditions**:
   - If `k` is a power of two, the state remains as described.
   - If `k` is not a power of two, additional variables (`l`, `p`, `q`, `f`) are defined, but these do not affect the value of `k`.
   - If `k` is odd, the state remains as described.

### Analysis:
- The value of `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- The conditions provided do not change the value of `k`; they only define additional variables based on whether `k` is a power of two or odd. However, these additional variables are not relevant to the `print(k)` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print(k)` statement will print the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, which is `k`.

### Output:
Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
