Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.**

In simple terms: The variable `l` has been added to the state, and it holds the binary representation of `k` (the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) as a string, with the '0b' prefix removed. All other variables retain their initial values.
