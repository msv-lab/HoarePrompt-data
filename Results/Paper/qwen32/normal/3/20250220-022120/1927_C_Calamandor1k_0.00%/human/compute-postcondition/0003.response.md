The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each of those strings to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are not modified by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers input by the user; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the next line of input.**
