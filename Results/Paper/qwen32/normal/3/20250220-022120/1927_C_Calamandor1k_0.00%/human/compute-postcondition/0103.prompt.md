Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 2 * min(`n`, `m`); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6. The sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
    count_a, count_b = 0, 0
    d = k // 2
    for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
        if len_a > i + 1:
            if a[i] <= k:
                count_a += 1
        if len_b > i + 1:
            if b[i] <= k:
                count_b += 1
    print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`; `d` is `k // 2`; `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`; `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` < 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `len_a` is the length of the list `a`; `len_b` is the length of the list `b`; `d` is `k // 2`; `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 < 10^4; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `len_a` is the length of the list `a`; `len_b` is the length of the new list `b`; `d` is `k // 2`; `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
