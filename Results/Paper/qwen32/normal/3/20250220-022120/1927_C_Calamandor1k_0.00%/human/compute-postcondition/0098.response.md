Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 < 10^4; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `len_a` is the length of the list `a` and must be at least 1 or `len_b` is the length of the new list `b` and must be at least 1; `d` is `k // 2`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `len_a` > `i + 1` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is `count_a` + 1; `count_b` is `count_b` + 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `count_b` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
