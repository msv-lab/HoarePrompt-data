The code snippet calculates the lengths of the lists `a` and `b` and assigns them to the variables `len_a` and `len_b`, respectively. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers input by the user; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the next line of input; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the next line of input; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`.**
