The code assigns a value to `nums[i]` based on the bit length of `k`. The value assigned is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a calculation involving `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the condition `i is i + 1` remain unchanged, except for the update to `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `nums[i]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
