You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`; `k` is `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two integers, `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first `n-1` elements of `nums` are all equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to create a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `k`.
3. It calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to compute the sequence.
4. The function `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
5. It then iterates over the list, setting each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` (which is the largest number with a bit length equal to `k`), and subtracts this value from `k`.
6. Finally, it adds the remaining value of `k` to the last element of the list.
7. The function returns the list `nums`.

### Issues in the Program
The main issue with the program is in the logic of how it constructs the sequence to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

- The program uses `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` to fill each element of the list, which is the largest number with the same bit length as `k`. This does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
- The program does not consider distributing the bits of `k` across multiple numbers to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Correct Approach
To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, we should distribute the bits of `k` across the numbers in the sequence such that each bit contributes to the OR result. One way to do this is to use the smallest possible numbers that contribute 1s to the OR result.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
