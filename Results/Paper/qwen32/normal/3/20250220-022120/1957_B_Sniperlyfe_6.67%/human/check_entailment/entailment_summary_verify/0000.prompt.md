You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Function Summary: 
The function takes two integers, `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first `n-1` elements of `nums` are all equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze why:

The function `func_1` is supposed to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. However, the current implementation does not achieve this goal.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. The function initializes all elements of the array `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but all bits set to 1 except the leading bit. This is not necessarily the optimal choice for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

2. The function then subtracts this value from `k` and assigns the remainder to the last element of the array. This does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the array will have the maximum number of 1s.

To illustrate, consider the test case `n = 2, k = 5`. The correct output should be `1 4` or `4 1` because `1 | 4 = 5` and `5` in binary is `101`, which has 2 ones. However, the provided program will output something like `3 2` (or similar), which does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

A correct approach would involve distributing the bits of `k` across the elements of the array in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. One possible strategy is to use the highest bits first to ensure that the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    i = 0
    while k > 0 and i < n:
        # Set the highest bit of k to the current number
        nums[i] = 1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)
        k -= nums[i]
        i += 1
    # Distribute the remaining k to the last element
    if i < n:
        nums[i] += k
    else:
        nums[-1] += k
    return nums
```

This approach ensures that the highest bits are used first, which helps in maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
