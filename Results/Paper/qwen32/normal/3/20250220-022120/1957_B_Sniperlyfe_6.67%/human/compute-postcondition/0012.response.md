Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.**

To break it down in natural language:
- The list `nums` contains `n` elements.
- The first `n-1` elements of the list are all equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- The last element of the list is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.
