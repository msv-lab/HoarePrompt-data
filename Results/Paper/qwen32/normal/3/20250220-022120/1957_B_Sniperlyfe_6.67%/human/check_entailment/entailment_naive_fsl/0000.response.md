Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze why:

The function `func_1` is supposed to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. However, the current implementation does not achieve this goal.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. The function initializes all elements of the array `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but all bits set to 1 except the leading bit. This is not necessarily the optimal choice for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

2. The function then subtracts this value from `k` and assigns the remainder to the last element of the array. This does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the array will have the maximum number of 1s.

To illustrate, consider the test case `n = 2, k = 5`. The correct output should be `1 4` or `4 1` because `1 | 4 = 5` and `5` in binary is `101`, which has 2 ones. However, the provided program will output something like `3 2` (or similar), which does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

A correct approach would involve distributing the bits of `k` across the elements of the array in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. One possible strategy is to use the highest bits first to ensure that the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    i = 0
    while k > 0 and i < n:
        # Set the highest bit of k to the current number
        nums[i] = 1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)
        k -= nums[i]
        i += 1
    # Distribute the remaining k to the last element
    if i < n:
        nums[i] += k
    else:
        nums[-1] += k
    return nums
```

This approach ensures that the highest bits are used first, which helps in maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
