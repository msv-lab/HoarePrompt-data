The code snippet `k -= nums[i]` subtracts the value of `nums[i]` from `k`. Given the initial state, `nums` is a list of `n` zeros except for `nums[i]` which has a specific value of `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This means `nums[i]` is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the bit length of `k` minus one.

So, `k` will be reduced by this specific value. The updated value of `k` will be `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of `n` zeros except `nums[i]` which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`; `k` is `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`**
