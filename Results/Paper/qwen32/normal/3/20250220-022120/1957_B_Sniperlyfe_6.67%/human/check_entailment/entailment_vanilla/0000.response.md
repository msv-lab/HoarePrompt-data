Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Construct a sequence** of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
2. **Maximize the number of 1s** in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads `t` test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence. Let's analyze `func_1(n, k)`:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization:** `nums` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
2. **Loop through `n`:** For each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
   - `nums[i]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` (but all bits set to 1 except possibly the leading bit).
   - `k` is then reduced by `nums[i]`.
3. **Adjust the last element:** The last element of `nums` is incremented by the remaining `k` to ensure the sum of all elements in `nums` equals `k`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Bitwise OR Maximization:** The program attempts to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR by setting each number in the sequence to a value with the same number of bits as `k` but all set to 1 (except possibly the leading bit). However, this does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of all elements.
- **Example:** For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the program would set both `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` to `3` (binary `11`), but the bitwise OR of `3 | 3` is still `3` (binary `11`), which only has 2 ones. The correct solution would be `1 | 2` (binary `11`), which also has 2 ones but satisfies the condition better by using distinct values that sum to `k`.

### Correctness:
The program does not always maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. While it ensures the sum of the sequence equals `k`, it does not guarantee the optimal solution in terms of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

**Correctness: False**
