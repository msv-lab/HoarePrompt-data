Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `nums[i]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `k - nums[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to be `k - nums[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `nums[i]`, and `i` remain unchanged.
