The code snippet modifies the `nums` list by setting `nums[i]` to a specific value. The value is calculated as `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Here's the breakdown:

- `k.bit_length()` gives the number of bits necessary to represent `k` in binary.
- `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1)` shifts the number 1 left by `k.bit_length() - 1` places, effectively creating a binary number with a 1 followed by `k.bit_length() - 1` zeros.
- Subtracting 1 from this value results in a binary number with `k.bit_length()` ones.

Since the code only specifies `nums[i]` and `i` is not defined in the snippet, we assume `i` is a specific index in the range of `nums`. However, the problem statement does not specify which index `i` is, so we can only describe the change to `nums[i]`.

After the execution, `nums[i]` will be set to a value of `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and all other elements of `nums` will remain zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of `n` zeros except `nums[i]` which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`**
