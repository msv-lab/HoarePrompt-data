The code snippet updates the value of `x` based on the new value of `i`. The initial state describes `x` as `n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))` and `i` as `i + 1`. After the code executes, `x` is reassigned to `n - (i * i - i)`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
- `cnt` is calculated based on the previous value of `i`.
- `x` is `n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))`.
- `y` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

After the code executes:
- `x` becomes `n - (i * i - i)`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `cnt`, `y`, and the updated `i` remain unchanged except for `x`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil((n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) / ((i + 1) * (i + 1))) + ((n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) % ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) == 0); `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
