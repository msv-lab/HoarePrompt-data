To determine the new state after the given Python code snippet executes, we need to evaluate the expression for `cnt` based on the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
- `cnt` is calculated as: `-1 + math.ceil((n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) / ((i + 1) * (i + 1))) + ((n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) % ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) == 0)`.
- `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`.
- `y` is `i * i`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

Code to execute:
```python
cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
```

The new `cnt` is calculated by adding the current `cnt` with `math.ceil(x / y)` and `1` if `x % y == 0`.

Let's break it down further:
- `math.ceil(x / y)` computes the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y`.
- `(x % y == 0)` evaluates to `1` if `x` is divisible by `y` without a remainder, otherwise `0`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is updated to `-1 + math.ceil((n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) / ((i + 1) * (i + 1))) + ((n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) % ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) == 0) + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0); `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the new `cnt` is the old `cnt` plus the ceiling of `x` divided by `y` plus `1` if `x` is divisible by `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
