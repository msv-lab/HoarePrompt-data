Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`; `cnt` is `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`**.

In simpler terms, the output state is: `n` and `m` remain the same positive integers within the specified range; `i` remains the value it had at the end of the previous iteration; `x` and `y` also remain as they were calculated (`x` as `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` as `i * i`); `cnt` is updated to include the ceiling of `x / y` plus 1 if `x` is exactly divisible by `y`.
