The value of `cnt` is updated based on the given formula. Initially, `cnt` is -1. The new value of `cnt` is calculated as `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`. The values of `x` and `y` are given as `n - (i * i - i)` and `i * i` respectively.

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0); `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`.**
