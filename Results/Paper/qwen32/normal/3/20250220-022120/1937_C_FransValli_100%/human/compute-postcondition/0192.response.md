Output State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `item`, `n` is the same as the input integer, `arr` has at least two elements, `res` is the string input by the user, `item` is the next element in `arr`.**

This means that the value of `mini` has been updated to be equal to `item`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
