To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (inclusive), and for each iteration, it makes a comparison and updates the `arr` list based on the user's input (`res`). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `maxi` is `n-1`
   - `arr` is `[0]`
   - `mini` is `9`
   - `n` is the input integer

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from `1` to `n-1`, the loop prints a query and waits for the user's input (`res`).
   - Depending on `res`:
     - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is updated to `[i]`.
     - If `res` is `'='`, `i` is appended to `arr`.
     - If `res` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `arr` remains unchanged.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes all iterations (`i` from `1` to `n-1`), the final state of `arr` will depend on all the user inputs (`res`) received during the loop.
   - `maxi` and `mini` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Given the above, the final output state after all iterations will be:
- `maxi` is still `n-1`
- `mini` is still `9`
- `n` remains the same
- `arr` will contain all indices `i` for which the user input was either `'<'` (which would reset `arr` to `[i]` and thus `arr` will only contain the last such `i`) or `'='` (which would append `i` to `arr`).

However, since the loop resets `arr` to `[i]` whenever `res` is `'<'`, the final `arr` will only contain the last `i` for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `arr` will contain all indices `i` for which `res` was `'='`, starting from the initial `[0]`.

**Output State**: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `arr` is the list of indices `i` for which `res` was `'='` or the last `i` for which `res` was `'<'`, `mini` is 9, `n` is the same as the input integer.**

In simpler terms, `arr` will either be a single-element list with the last index `i` where `res` was `'<'`, or a list starting with `0` and including all indices `i` where `res` was `'='`.
