Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. While the program attempts to identify the maximum and minimum values in the permutation, it does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of these values will be the maximum possible.

The strategy to maximize the XOR of two numbers involves finding the two numbers that differ as much as possible in their binary representation. This typically involves finding the two numbers with the most different bits, which is not what the current program does. The program only identifies the maximum and minimum values, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum XOR.

Here is a high-level outline of a correct approach:
1. Identify the maximum value in the permutation.
2. Identify the value that has the maximum XOR with the maximum value.

This can be achieved by comparing the maximum value with each other value in the permutation to find the one that results in the maximum XOR. The provided program does not perform this step correctly.
