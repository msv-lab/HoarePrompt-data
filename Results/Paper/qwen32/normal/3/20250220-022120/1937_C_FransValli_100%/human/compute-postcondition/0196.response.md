To determine the final state of the loop after all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each test case. The loop processes each test case independently, and the state variables (`maxi`, `arr`, `mini`) are reset for each new test case. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization (`maxi`)**: The loop finds the index `maxi` such that the bitwise OR of `p_maxi` with itself is the largest among all elements. Since `p_maxi OR p_maxi` is just `p_maxi`, `maxi` ends up being the index of the largest element in the permutation.

2. **Building `arr`**: The loop then constructs an array `arr` that includes indices `i` where the bitwise OR of `p_maxi` and `p_arr[0]` is less than the bitwise OR of `p_maxi` and `p_i`. If the bitwise OR is equal, `i` is appended to `arr`.

3. **Finding `mini`**: Finally, the loop finds the smallest index `mini` in `arr` such that the bitwise OR of `p_mini` with itself is greater than the bitwise OR of `p_item` with itself for all `item` in `arr` that are not `mini`.

After processing all test cases, the final output for each test case is the pair of indices `(maxi, mini)` that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements in the permutation.

Given the loop's behavior, the final output state after all iterations will be determined by the last test case processed. The variables `maxi` and `mini` will reflect the values for the last test case, and `arr` will be the array built for that last test case.

Since the problem specifies that the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^4, and we are only interested in the final output state, we can conclude that the final output state will be the result of the last test case processed.

**Output State: **maxi, mini for the last test case processed.**

In natural language, the output state after all iterations is the pair of indices `(maxi, mini)` for the last test case, where `maxi` is the index of the largest element in the permutation, and `mini` is the index of the smallest element in the subset of elements that maximizes the bitwise XOR with the element at `maxi`.
