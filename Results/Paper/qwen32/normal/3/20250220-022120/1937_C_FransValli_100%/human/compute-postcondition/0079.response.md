The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1, we need to adjust `i` to the next value and ensure `n` remains greater than the new `i`.

So, if `i` was incremented to some value `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k` and `n` must be greater than `k`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i`, `res` is the value of the new user's input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and if `res` is `'<'`, `maxi` is set to the new value of `i`**.

To be more specific, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `k-1`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` is `k` and `n` must be greater than `k`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i`, `res` is the value of the new user's input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**

Since we don't have the exact previous value of `i`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than `i`, `res` is the value of the new user's input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
