To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `maxi` is defined as `n-1`, where `n` is the input integer.
- `mini` is either `0` or `n-1`.
- `arr` must have at least two elements.
- The variable `item` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, which suggests it might be defined elsewhere in the code, but it is not clear from the given information. For the sake of this task, we will assume `item` is a variable that has been defined elsewhere and holds some value.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
- It will then output the value of `mini` twice.
- It will then output the value of `item` twice.

### Variables:
- `mini` can be either `0` or `n-1`.
- `item` is a variable whose value is not provided in the initial state, so we will denote it as `item`.

### Output Description:
The output will be a string that starts with `?`, followed by the value of `mini` twice, and then the value of `item` twice.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where mini is either 0 or n-1, and item is the value of the variable item)**
