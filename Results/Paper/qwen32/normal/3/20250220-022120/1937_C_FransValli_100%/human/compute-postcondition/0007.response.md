The code `maxi = i` updates the value of `maxi` to be equal to the value of `i`. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `i`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `maxi` after the assignment. However, we know that `maxi` will now hold whatever value `i` held.

The other variables (`n`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is `i`; `res` is an input string and `res` equals '<'.**
