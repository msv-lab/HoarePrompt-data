The value of `mini` is assigned the value of `item`, which is 9. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxi` is 5, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `res` is the user's input string, `item` is 9, and `mini` is 9.
Output State: **`maxi` is 5, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `res` is the user's input string, `item` is 9, `mini` is 9**.
