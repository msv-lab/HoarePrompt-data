Postcondition: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[i, i]` if `arr` was `[i]`, `[0, i, i]` if `arr` was `[0, i]`, otherwise `arr` is `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`. If `res` is not `'='`, `arr` remains unchanged. `res` is the value of the input string; `i` is `maxi + 1`.**
