Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[0]`; `res` is the value of the input string.**

Here, `res` has been assigned the value of the input string, while all other variables (`n`, `maxi`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
