The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Let's analyze the variables mentioned in the print statement:

- `maxi` is given as 5.
- `arr` is given as [3, 7, 9].
- `mini` is given as 3.
- `item` is not defined in the provided initial state.

Since `item` is not defined in the initial state, it would raise a `NameError` when the `print` statement is executed. However, since the task is to determine what will be printed based on the given information, and `item` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables that are known.

Given that `item` is undefined, we can't provide a precise value for it. However, we can describe the output based on the known values of `mini` and the literal string `'?'`.

Output: **? 3 3 item item (where item is undefined and will raise an error if executed)**

Since the task specifies to provide the most precise description possible, and considering `item` is undefined, the output description must reflect this.

Output: **? 3 3 item item**
