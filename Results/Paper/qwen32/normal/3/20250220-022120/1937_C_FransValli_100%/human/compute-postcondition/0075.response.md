To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `res` is the value of the user's input (though `res` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `maxi` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we will assume `maxi` has some value that was set before this print statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- `'?'` is a string literal and will be printed as is.
- `maxi` is printed twice. Since `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, we can only say that it has some value that was previously set in the code.
- `i` is printed twice. Since `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, it will have the value it had before the increment, plus 1.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be a string that starts with `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi` twice, and the value of `i` (which has been incremented by 1) twice.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where [maxi] is the value of maxi and [i] is the incremented value of i)**

To illustrate this with a concrete example:
- Suppose `maxi` was 5 and `i` was 3 before the increment.
- After `i` is incremented by 1, `i` becomes 4.
- The output would be: `? 5 5 4 4`.

However, since we don't have the exact values of `maxi` and `i`, we describe them in terms of their roles and the operations performed on them.

Final Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where [maxi] is the value of maxi and [i] is the incremented value of i)**
