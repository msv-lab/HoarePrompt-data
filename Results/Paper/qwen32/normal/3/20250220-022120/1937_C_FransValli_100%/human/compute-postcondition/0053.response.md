The only object in the loop head is the variable `item`. According to the code, the loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, which means `item` will take the values from the second element of `arr` onwards.

At the end of the previous iteration, `item` was the last element that was processed from `arr[1:]`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `arr[1:]` that has not yet been processed. Therefore, `item` should now be the next element in `arr[1:]`.

Let's denote the current value of `item` as `arr[k]` where `k` is the index of `item` in `arr` starting from 1 (since we are iterating over `arr[1:]`). For the next iteration, `item` should be `arr[k+1]`.

Since we do not know the exact current index `k` of `item` in `arr[1:]`, we can only say that `item` should be the next element in the sequence.

State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains at least two elements where the first element is `mini` and the rest are `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`; `mini` is `item`; if the current value of `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is updated to the current item; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`.**
