The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `1, n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `n-1`.

The values of `maxi`, `mini`, `n`, `res`, and `arr` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is 9, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the user's input. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` contains `i` as its last element. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.**
