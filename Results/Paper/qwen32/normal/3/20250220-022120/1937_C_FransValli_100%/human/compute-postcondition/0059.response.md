To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Variables and Their Descriptions:
1. **`mini`**: This is the first element of the list `arr` and is updated if the current `item` (next element in `arr[1:]`) is greater than the current `mini`. Initially, `mini` is set to the first element of `arr`.
2. **`item`**: This is the next element in the list `arr` after `mini`. It is used to compare with `mini` to potentially update `mini`.
3. **`arr`**: A list where the first element is `mini` and the rest are `i` values for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`. The list contains at least two elements.
4. **`res`**: The input string which can be `'<'`, `'='`, or `'>'`. It influences the value of `mini` and `item`.
5. **`maxi`**: The largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0. This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is `print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)`.
- This means the output will be the string `'?'` followed by the value of `mini` twice, and the value of `item` twice.
- Since `mini` is the first element of `arr` and `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`, the output will be `'?'` followed by `mini`, `mini`, `item`, and `item`.

### Example:
If `arr` is `[5, 3, 2, 4]`, then:
- `mini` is `5` (the first element of `arr`).
- `item` is `3` (the next element in `arr[1:]`).
- The output will be `'?'`, `5`, `5`, `3`, `3`.

### Output:
Based on the analysis, the output will be:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the first element of arr and [item] is the next element in arr[1:])**
