The code snippet assigns the value of the first element of the list `arr` to the variable `mini`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `maxi`, and the contents of `arr`) are not modified by this assignment.

Given that `arr` contains all `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`, the value of `mini` will be the first element of this list.

Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains all `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`; `mini` is `arr[0]`.**
