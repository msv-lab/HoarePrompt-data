To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `maxi` is defined as `n-1`.
- `mini` is defined as 9, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is defined as `n-2`.
- `arr` is a list, but the exact elements of this list are not provided, so we only know that `arr[0]` refers to the first element of this list.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

We can break down the values to be printed:
1. `'?'`: This is a literal string.
2. `maxi`: This is `n-1`.
3. `arr[0]`: This is the first element of the list `arr`, which we don't have the exact value for.
4. `maxi`: This is again `n-1`.
5. `i`: This is `n-2`.

Putting it together, the output will be:
Output: **? [n-1] [arr[0]] [n-1] [n-2] (where [n-1] is the value of maxi, [arr[0]] is the first element of the list arr, and [n-2] is the value of i)**

This format ensures that we describe the values precisely based on the given information.
