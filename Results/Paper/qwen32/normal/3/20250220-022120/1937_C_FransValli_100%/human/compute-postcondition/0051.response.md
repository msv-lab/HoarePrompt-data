The code snippet `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` to the variable `mini`. The other variables (`n`, `maxi`, `arr`, `res`) are not affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, `mini` is the first element of `arr`, and `item` is not specified in the initial state but is presumably a new value that is being assigned to `mini`.

Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains at least two elements where the first element is `mini` and the rest are `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`; `mini` is `item`; `res` is an input string; the current value of `res` is `'>'`.**
