The code snippet provided initializes a list named `arr` with a single element `0`. This action does not affect the variable `maxi` in any way. The value of `maxi` remains as it was defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is `[0]`**.
