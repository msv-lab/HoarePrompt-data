The value of `maxi` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `n` and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the value of the new user's input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `maxi` is equal to the new value of `i`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `res` is the value of the new user's input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `maxi` is equal to the new value of `i`.**
