The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 (since the range starts from 1 and we are at the end of the first iteration), `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is 7 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` remains 0, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], and `mini` is 9. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`maxi` is 7 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` remains 0, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `mini` is 9, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
