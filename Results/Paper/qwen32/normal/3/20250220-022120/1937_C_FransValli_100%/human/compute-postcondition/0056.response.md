Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains at least two elements where the first element is `mini` and the rest are `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`; `mini` is the current `item`; if the current value of `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is updated to the current item; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`; `res` is the input string.**

Explanation: The value of `mini` is updated to the current `item`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
