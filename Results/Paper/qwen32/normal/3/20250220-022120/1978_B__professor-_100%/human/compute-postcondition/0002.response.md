The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state does not specify the values of `n`, `a`, or `b`, so they are now assigned based on the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input.**
