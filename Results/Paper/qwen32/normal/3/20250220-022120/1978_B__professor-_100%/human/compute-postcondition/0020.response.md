The code provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means that the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated based on the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
