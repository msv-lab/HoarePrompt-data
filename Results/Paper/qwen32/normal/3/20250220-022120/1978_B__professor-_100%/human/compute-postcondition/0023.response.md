Let's break down the provided code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Calculate \(b - a\)**:
   - This is the difference between `b` and `a`.

2. **Calculate \((b - a) * (b - a + 1)\)**:
   - This is the product of the difference between `b` and `a` and the next consecutive integer.

3. **Calculate \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2\)**:
   - This is the integer division of the product by 2. This expression calculates the sum of all integers from `a` to `b` inclusive.
   - The formula used here is the sum of an arithmetic series from `a` to `b`, which is \(\frac{(b - a + 1) \times (a + b)}{2}\). However, the given formula \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2\) is actually calculating the sum of the first \((b - a + 1)\) integers starting from 0 and then adjusting it by adding `a` to each term. This is equivalent to the sum of integers from `a` to `b`.

4. **Calculate \(a \times n\)**:
   - This is the product of `a` and `n`.

5. **Sum the two results**:
   - Add the sum of integers from `a` to `b` and the product of `a` and `n`.

6. **Convert the result to an integer**:
   - The `int()` function is used, but since the operations inside are already integer operations, this conversion doesn't change the value.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n\).

Output: **the sum of all integers from `a` to `b` inclusive plus `a` multiplied by `n`**
