Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integers read from the input. If `b - a >= n`, then the conditions of the if part are met. Otherwise, the conditions of the else part are met. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
