The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution condition. The loop executes `t` times, and the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the state of `t` is the only relevant state to consider for the loop's continuation.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since the loop iterates `t` times, at the start of each iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, except for the first iteration where `t` retains its initial value.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Given that `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this decrement.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is less than or equal to `a`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than `a`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.**
