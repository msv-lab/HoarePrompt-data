You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationships between `n`, `a`, and `b`. The input values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob sells buns with a regular price `a` but offers a promotion where the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins each, where `i` is the bun number (starting from 1). The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the regular price `a` coins each. The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can make.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum profit by considering three scenarios:
1. If `b <= a`, then selling all buns at the regular price `a`.
2. If `b - a >= n`, then selling all buns at the modified price, which is a decreasing sequence from `b` to `b - n + 1`.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the profit by selling the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the regular price.

### Edge Cases and Verification:
Let's verify if the program covers all edge cases and correctly calculates the maximum profit.

#### Case 1: `b <= a`
- The program correctly sells all buns at the regular price `a`.
- Example: `n=4`, `a=5`, `b=4` => `4 * 5 = 20` (Correct)

#### Case 2: `b - a >= n`
- The program correctly sells all buns at the modified price, which is a decreasing sequence from `b` to `b - n + 1`.
- Example: `n=5`, `a=5`, `b=9` => `(9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5) = 35` (Correct)

#### Case 3: `b - a < n`
- The program calculates the profit by selling the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the regular price.
- Example: `n=10`, `a=10`, `b=5` => `0 * (5 - 10 + 1) + 10 * 10 = 100` (Correct)

However, there is a logical error in the program:
- The formula for the third case is incorrect. It should calculate the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the modified price and then add the profit from the remaining buns sold at the regular price.
- The current formula `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)` is incorrect because it doesn't correctly calculate the sum of the modified prices for the first `b - a` buns.

### Correct Formula for Case 3:
The correct formula to calculate the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the modified price is:
\[ \text{sum\_modified\_price} = \frac{(b + (b - (b - a) + 1)) \times (b - a)}{2} \]
\[ \text{total\_profit} = \text{sum\_modified\_price} + a \times (n - (b - a)) \]

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the third case, and thus does not provide the correct maximum profit for all scenarios.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the maximum profit in the third case where `b - a < n`. The logic for summing the modified prices for the first `b - a` buns is flawed.
