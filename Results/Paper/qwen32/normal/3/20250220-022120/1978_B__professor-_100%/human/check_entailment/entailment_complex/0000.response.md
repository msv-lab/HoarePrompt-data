### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and verify that it correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain under the given conditions.

1. **Base Case: `b <= a`**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should not use the promotion because it would not increase his profit. Therefore, he should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The formula used in the program for this case is `n * a`, which correctly calculates the total profit.

2. **Case: `b - a >= n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob can sell all buns at decreasing prices from `b` down to `b - n + 1`.
   - The formula used in the program for this case is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`. This formula calculates the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`.
   - The sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1` is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term}) = \frac{n}{2} \times (b + (b - n + 1)) = \frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)
     \]
   - This matches the formula used in the program.

3. **General Case: `b - a < n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell `k = b - a` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The formula used in the program for this case is `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.
   - The sum of the first `k = b - a` terms of the arithmetic series (from `b` to `b - k + 1`) is:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1)) = \frac{(b - a)}{2} \times (2b - (b - a) + 1) = \frac{(b - a)}{2} \times (b + a + 1)
     \]
   - Simplifying the above expression:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b + a + 1)}{2} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + \frac{(b - a) \times a}{2}
     \]
   - This can be written as:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (b - a)
     \]
   - Since Bob sells the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`, the total profit is:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n
     \]
   - This matches the formula used in the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given cases and calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain based on the relationships between `n`, `a`, and `b`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
