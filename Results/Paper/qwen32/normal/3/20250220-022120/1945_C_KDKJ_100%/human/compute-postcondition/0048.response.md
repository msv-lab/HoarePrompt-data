The code snippet `lsum = i` updates the value of `lsum` to the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in `a`, `ans` is `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `lsum` is now equal to `i`. All other variables retain their previous values.
