Output State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in `a`; `ans` is either -1 or the value of `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in `S`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

The `continue` statement does not change any of the variable values. The program will simply proceed to the next iteration of the loop, maintaining the current values of all variables as specified in the initial state.
