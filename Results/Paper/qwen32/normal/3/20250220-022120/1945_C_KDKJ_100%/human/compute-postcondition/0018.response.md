The code `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the values of the last element in the list `S` to the variables `x` and `y`. Given that the last element of `S` is `[x, y]`, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to those of the last element of `S`.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string with at least one character, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]`, where `x` and `y` are determined by the first and second characters of `a` as specified, `s` is the second character of `a`.

After the code execution:
- `x` and `y` are updated to the values of the last element of `S`, which are the same `x` and `y` that were already part of the list `S`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string with at least one character, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]`, `s` is the second character of `a`, `x` and `y` are the values of the last element of `S`.**
