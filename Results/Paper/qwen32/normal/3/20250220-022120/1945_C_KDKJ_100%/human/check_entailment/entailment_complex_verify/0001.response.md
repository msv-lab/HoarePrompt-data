### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program using the provided annotations and the problem description to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The road should be placed such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side.
2. The position should be as close to the middle of the village as possible, i.e., minimize `|n/2 - i|`.
3. If there are multiple such positions, choose the smallest one.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_1()`:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - `S` is a list of lists where `S[i]` stores the cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s from the start of the string up to the `i-1`th character.
   - The loop correctly updates the cumulative counts for each character in the string `a`.

2. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `-1` to signify that no valid position has been found yet.
   - The program iterates over all possible positions `i` from `0` to `n` (inclusive).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: The number of `0`s to the left of the road.
     - `lsum`: The total number of houses to the left of the road.
     - `right`: The number of `1`s to the right of the road.
     - `rsum`: The total number of houses to the right of the road.
   - The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` are correctly used to check if the current position `i` satisfies the requirement that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - If the conditions are met, it checks if the current position `i` is closer to `n/2` than the previously found position `ans`. If it is, `ans` is updated to `i`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the position `ans` after the loop.

#### Annotations:
- **State of `S`**: The annotations confirm that `S` is correctly updated to store cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s.
- **State of `ans`**: The annotations confirm that `ans` is correctly updated to the position that meets the conditions and is closest to `n/2`.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house by initializing `ans` to `-1` and updating it accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the prefix sums, checks the conditions for each possible position, and selects the optimal position based on the given criteria.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
