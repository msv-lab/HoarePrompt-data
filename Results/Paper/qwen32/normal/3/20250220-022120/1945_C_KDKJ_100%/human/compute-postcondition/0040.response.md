The given code snippet updates the value of `right` based on the current index `i`. The new value of `right` is calculated as the difference between the y-coordinate of the last element in the list `S` and the y-coordinate of the `i`-th element in the list `S`.

Output State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in `a`; `ans` is either -1 or the value of `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in `S`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`. If `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, `ans` remains -1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `right` has been updated to the difference between the y-coordinate of the last point in the list `S` and the y-coordinate of the `i`-th point in the list `S`. All other variables remain unchanged.
