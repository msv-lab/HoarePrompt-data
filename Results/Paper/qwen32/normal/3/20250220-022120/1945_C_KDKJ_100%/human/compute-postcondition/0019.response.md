Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string with at least one character, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x+1, y]]`, `s` is the second character of `a`, `x` is the value of the last element's first value of `S` incremented by 1, `y` is the value of the last element's second value of `S`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `x` in the last element of `S` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
