### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The program is structured to handle multiple test cases, with `func_2` being the main function that reads the number of test cases and repeatedly calls `func_1` for each test case.

**Function `func_1`:**
- This function reads the number of houses `n` and a string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
- It constructs a list `S` where each element is a pair `[x, y]` representing the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to the current position in the string `a`.
- It then iterates through all possible positions `i` where the road could be placed (from 0 to `n`).
- For each position, it calculates the number of '0's to the left of the road (`left`) and the number of '1's to the right of the road (`right`).
- It checks if the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are satisfied, where `lsum` is the number of houses to the left of the road, and `rsum` is the number of houses to the right of the road.
- It keeps track of the position `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and meets the conditions.
- Finally, it prints the position `i`.

**Function `func_2`:**
- This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly processes each test case independently.
- It correctly calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's using the list `S`.
- It correctly checks the conditions for each possible position `i` where the road could be placed.
- It correctly finds the position `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and meets the conditions.
- It handles the edge cases where the road could be placed before the first house or after the last house.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
