To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State:
1. `S` is a list of coordinates starting from `[0, 0]` and ending with `[x, y]`.
2. `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
3. `ans` is the value of `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and meets the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`, or `-1` if no such `i` exists.

### Analysis:
- The list `S` contains coordinates, starting from `[0, 0]` and ending with `[x, y]`.
- `n` is the number of elements in the list `S`, and it is given that `n` is non-negative.
- `ans` is determined based on the following:
  - `i` is an index in the list `S`.
  - `left` and `right` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer that they are likely sums or values derived from the elements in `S` up to and beyond index `i`.
  - `lsum` and `rsum` are also not explicitly defined, but they are likely sums of some subset of the elements in `S`.
  - The condition `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` must be satisfied for `i` to be considered.
  - If no such `i` exists, `ans` is `-1`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `left`, `right`, `lsum`, and `rsum` are not provided, and the list `S` is only described in terms of its start and end points, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the conditions under which `ans` is determined.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the index `i` in the list `S` that is closest to `n / 2` and meets the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`. If no such `i` exists, `ans` will be `-1`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the index i in the list S that is closest to n / 2 and meets the conditions left * 2 >= lsum and right * 2 >= rsum, or -1 if no such i exists)**
