Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string with at least one character, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x+1, y]]` if `s` is '0', otherwise `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y+1]]`. `s` is the second character of `a`. If `s` is '0', `x` is the value of the last element's first value of `S` incremented by 1, and `y` remains the same. If `s` is not '0', `y` is the value of the last element's second value of `S` incremented by 1, and `x` remains the same.**
