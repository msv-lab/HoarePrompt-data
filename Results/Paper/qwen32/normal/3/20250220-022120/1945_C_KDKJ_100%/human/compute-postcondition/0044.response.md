Postcondition: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in `a`. `ans` is `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `n` is greater than or equal to 0. `left` is the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in `S`. `lsum` is `i`. `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. `rsum` is `n - i`. `i` is `i + 1`.**
