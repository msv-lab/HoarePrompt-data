The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. Since `_` does not retain any state between iterations and is not used within the loop body, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of iterations, which is derived from `int(input())`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer doubled, and `int(input())` must be equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1 (since the loop will have already completed one iteration).

Let's break it down:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` was a positive integer doubled, and `int(input())` was equal to `n`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` should be equal to `n - 1`.

Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n - 1` to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration.

State: **The input to the function must be a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer doubled minus 1**.
