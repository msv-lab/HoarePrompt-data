The code appends a new list `[x, y]` to the list `S`. The values of `x` and `y` are determined based on the condition of the string `a`. If the first character of `a` is `'0'`, then `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`. The initial state of `S` is `[[0, 0]]`, and after appending `[x, y]`, `S` will be `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`.

Given the initial conditions, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`. If the first character of `a` is `'0'`, then `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`.**
