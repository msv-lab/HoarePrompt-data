In the given task, the for loop is dependent on the value provided by the user input, which is then converted to an integer and used to determine the number of iterations. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

Since the loop will execute based on the integer value obtained from the user input, we need to ensure that the input value is such that the loop can execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need any specific state adjustment because it is not used within the loop body (as per the provided information).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the user input, which should be a positive integer to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **The input to the function must be a positive integer**.
