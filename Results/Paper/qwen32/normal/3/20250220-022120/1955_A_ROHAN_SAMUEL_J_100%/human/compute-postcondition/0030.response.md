Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
3. There is a condition that checks if `2 * a` is less than `b`. This condition is not directly used in the print statement but might influence the logic of the program in other parts.
4. The loop will run for `int(input()) - 1` more iterations. However, this loop detail does not affect the current `print` statement directly.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Analysis:
- `n // 2` is integer division of `n` by 2, which means it will give the floor value of `n/2`.
- The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

### Output:
The output will be the product of `n // 2` and `b`.

To make this more precise:
- `n // 2` will give the integer part of `n` divided by 2.
- This result is then multiplied by `b`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `n // 2` and `b`.

Output: **(n // 2) * b (where n is an integer read from the input and b is an integer read from the input)**
