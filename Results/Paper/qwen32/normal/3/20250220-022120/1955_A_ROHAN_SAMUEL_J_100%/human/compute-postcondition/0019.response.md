Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `n` is odd, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The loop will run for `int(input()) - 1` more iterations.**

Since the postconditions of both the if and else parts are identical, the overall postcondition for the if-else block remains the same as the precondition, with no additional changes to the variables or their relationships.
