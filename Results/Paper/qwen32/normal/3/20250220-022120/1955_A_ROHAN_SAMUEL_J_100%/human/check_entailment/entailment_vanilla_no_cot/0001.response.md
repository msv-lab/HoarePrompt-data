Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly computes the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts given the conditions.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Single Yogurt Price:** `a` burles.
2. **Promotion Price for Two Yogurts:** `b` burles.
3. **Objective:** Determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

### Key Observations:
- If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b` if `b < 2 * a`. Otherwise, buy them individually at price `a`.
- If `n` is odd, the optimal strategy is to buy `(n - 1) // 2` pairs at the promotion price `b` and 1 yogurt individually at price `a` if `b < 2 * a`. Otherwise, buy all yogurts individually at price `a`.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the program logic for both even and odd `n`:

#### Case 1: `n` is odd (`n % 2 != 0`)
- **Condition:** `if n % 2`
  - **Sub-case 1:** `if 2 * a < b`
    - **Action:** `print(a * n)`
      - **Reason:** Since `2 * a < b`, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually.
  - **Sub-case 2:** `else`
    - **Action:** `print(n // 2 * b + a)`
      - **Reason:** Buy `(n - 1) // 2` pairs at `b` burles each and 1 yogurt individually.

#### Case 2: `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`)
- **Condition:** `elif 2 * a < b`
  - **Action:** `print(a * n)`
    - **Reason:** Since `2 * a < b`, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually.
- **Condition:** `else`
  - **Action:** `print(n // 2 * b)`
    - **Reason:** Buy `n // 2` pairs at `b` burles each.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
   - `n` is even.
   - `2 * a = 10 > 9 = b`, so buy 1 pair at 9 burles.
   - **Output:** `9` (Correct)

2. **Example 2: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a = 10 > 9 = b`, so buy 1 pair at 9 burles and 1 yogurt individually at 5 burles.
   - **Output:** `14` (Correct)

3. **Example 3: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a = 10 < 11 = b`, so buy all 3 yogurts individually.
   - **Output:** `15` (Correct)

4. **Example 4: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
   - `n` is even.
   - `2 * a = 10 < 11 = b`, so buy all 4 yogurts individually.
   - **Output:** `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

**Correctness:** **True**
