Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print(a * n)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `n` is an even number.
- The current value of `2 * a` is less than `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * n)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet will print the product of `a` and `n`.
- From the initial state, we know that `n` is an even number, but we do not have an explicit value for `n`.
- Similarly, we do not have an explicit value for `a`, but we know that `2 * a < b`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can describe the output in terms of the variables `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a is an integer such that 2 * a < b, and n is an even integer)**
