### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts considering both the regular price `a` per yogurt and the promotion price `b` for two yogurts. The program handles the cases where `n` is either odd or even and compares the total cost using the regular price versus the promotion price.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price per yogurt), and `b` (price for two yogurts).

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation:**
   - **When `n` is odd:**
     - The program checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying them individually (`2 * a`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`) and buys the remaining single yogurt at the regular price (`a`).

   - **When `n` is even:**
     - Similar to the odd case, the program checks if the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it buys each yogurt individually, resulting in a total cost of `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, resulting in a total cost of `n // 2 * b`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the minimum cost calculated based on the above logic.

### Verification with Example Cases:

Let's verify the program's correctness using the provided example cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the program buys both yogurts at the promotion price, resulting in a cost of `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the program buys two yogurts at the promotion price (`9`) and one yogurt at the regular price (`5`), resulting in a total cost of `14`.

3. **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, resulting in a total cost of `15`.

4. **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, resulting in a total cost of `20`.

The program handles all these cases correctly, producing the expected outputs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to compute the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts considering both the regular and promotion prices. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
