The loop in the given code is controlled by the variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a number of times specified by `int(input())`. The loop head only contains this throwaway variable `_` and the range function which is controlled by the input.

Since the loop head does not directly involve `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`, the only state that can be adjusted is the number of iterations left in the loop. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable, we only need to consider the number of iterations remaining, which is controlled by the input.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one iteration. Therefore, the number of iterations left would be one less than the previous number of iterations.

Given that the loop runs for `int(input())` times, let's denote the initial number of iterations by `x`, where `x = int(input())`. After the previous iteration, the loop would have `x - 1` iterations left.

Since the loop head does not involve `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`, these variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `n` is odd, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The loop will run for `int(input()) - 1` more iterations.**
