The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `M`. No other variables are modified, and the conditions on `q`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 100, and for each of the q test cases, there are two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 <= `x` < `n` <= 10^9; `M` is an empty list.**
