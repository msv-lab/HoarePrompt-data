Postcondition: **`q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 100, `n` and `x` are integers for each of the `q` test cases with 1 <= `x` < `n` <= 10^9, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and `w` must be at least 2, `M` is a list containing the integer `w` if `w` is an integer and `w` >= `x - 1`, otherwise `M` remains an empty list. Additionally, `q` is divisible by `i`.**
