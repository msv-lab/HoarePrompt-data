To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the range limit `int(w // 1)`. The loop condition is `for i in range(1, int(w // 1))`. This means `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `int(w // 1)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 100.
- `n` and `x` are integers for each of the `q` test cases with 1 <= `x` < `n` <= 10^9.
- `w` is the integer square root of `q` and `w` must be at least 2.
- `M` is a list that may include `q // i` if `q // i` >= `x - 1`, in addition to its previous elements. If `q % i == 0` and `i` >= `x - 1`, `M` includes the integer `i`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Let's analyze the loop head:
- The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop continues as long as `i < int(w // 1)`.

Since `w` is the integer square root of `q` and `w` must be at least 2, `int(w // 1)` is simply `w // 1` (integer division).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is some value `k` such that `1 <= k < w // 1`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 100, `n` and `x` are integers for each of the `q` test cases with 1 <= `x` < `n` <= 10^9, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and `w` must be at least 2, `M` is a list that may include `q // i` if `q // i` >= `x - 1`, in addition to its previous elements. If `q % i == 0` and `i` >= `x - 1`, `M` includes the integer `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `i` is now `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Given that `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 100, `n` and `x` are integers for each of the `q` test cases with 1 <= `x` < `n` <= 10^9, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and `w` must be at least 2, `M` is a list that may include `q // i` if `q // i` >= `x - 1`, in addition to its previous elements. If `q % i == 0` and `i` >= `x - 1`, `M` includes the integer `i`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.
