The code snippet `M += [i]` appends the integer `i` to the list `M`. Given the initial state, `M` either contains the integer `w` if `w` is an integer and `w` >= `x - 1`, or it is an empty list. After executing the code, `M` will now include the integer `i` as an additional element.

Output State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 100, `n` and `x` are integers for each of the `q` test cases with 1 <= `x` < `n` <= 10^9, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and `w` must be at least 2, `M` is a list containing the integer `w` if `w` is an integer and `w` >= `x - 1`, otherwise `M` remains an empty list, and now `M` also includes the integer `i`. Additionally, `q` is divisible by `i`, and `i` is such that `i` >= `x - 1`.**
