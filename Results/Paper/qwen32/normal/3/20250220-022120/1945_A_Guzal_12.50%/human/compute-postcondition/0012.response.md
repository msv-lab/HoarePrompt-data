Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 0. If `b` is not divisible by 3, `c` is less than 3, and the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3`, and if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is incremented by 1. Additionally, either `b % 3 == 0` or `c >= 3` or `(b + c) % 3 == 0` holds true.**
