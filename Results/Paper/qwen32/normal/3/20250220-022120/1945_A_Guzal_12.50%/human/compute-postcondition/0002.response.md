The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and each of the next `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9. The value of `n` must be greater than 0, but `n` is not used in the provided code snippet.

After executing the code, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the integer values from the input line. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and it is still true that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid but has no impact on the current code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9, `n` must be greater than 0.**
