The code snippet increments `k` by the value of `a + (b + c) // 3`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line, and `k` is initially 0. The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`**.
