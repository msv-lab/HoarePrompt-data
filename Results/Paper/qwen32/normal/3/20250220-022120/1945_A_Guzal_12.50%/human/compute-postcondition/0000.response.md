Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the next `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input. The initial state of `t` and the conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
