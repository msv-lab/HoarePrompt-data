Initial State: Each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, `m` (1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `m` ≤ 10^18) representing the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, and the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky. The number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.

```
t = int(input())
```

The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they have not been assigned any values yet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; `a`, `b`, `m` are each integers between 1 and 10^18**.
