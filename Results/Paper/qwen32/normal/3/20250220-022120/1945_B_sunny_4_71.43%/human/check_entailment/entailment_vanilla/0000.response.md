Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible in the sky at the same time. Each installation launches fireworks at regular intervals (every `a` and `b` minutes respectively) and each firework is visible for `m+1` minutes after it is launched.

### Key Points
1. **Launch Intervals**: The first installation launches fireworks at `a`, `2a`, `3a`, ..., and the second installation launches fireworks at `b`, `2b`, `3b`, ...
2. **Visibility Duration**: Each firework is visible from the time it is launched until `m` minutes after its launch.
3. **Overlap Calculation**: We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that overlap at any point in time.

### Approach
To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the visibility intervals of fireworks launched by both installations. The approach should involve calculating how many fireworks from each installation can be visible within a given interval and then finding the maximum overlap.

### Analysis of Provided Code
The provided code calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation independently and then sums them up:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        print(A + B)
```
- **A**: Number of fireworks from the first installation that can be visible within the first `m+1` minutes.
- **B**: Number of fireworks from the second installation that can be visible within the first `m+1` minutes.

### Flaws in the Provided Code
The provided code does not account for the overlap between fireworks from the two installations. It simply sums the number of fireworks from each installation, which is incorrect because fireworks from both installations can overlap in time.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the cycle in which fireworks from both installations are launched and then determine the maximum overlap within that cycle. This involves more complex calculations to find the exact number of overlapping fireworks.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
