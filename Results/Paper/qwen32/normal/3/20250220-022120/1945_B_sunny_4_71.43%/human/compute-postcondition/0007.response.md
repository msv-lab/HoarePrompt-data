The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. This means the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `m` as defined in the initial state are overwritten by the new values provided by the input.

The initial state mentioned that `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18, and `A` and `B` are calculated based on these values. However, since `a`, `b`, and `m` are reassigned, the values of `A` and `B` calculated previously are no longer valid and need to be recalculated based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Since the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are taken from the input, the output state will only reflect these new assignments, and `A` and `B` will not be recalculated in this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers provided by the input.**
