### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the provided code. The code calculates the number of fireworks from each installation independently and sums them up without considering the overlap between fireworks from the two installations. This is indeed incorrect because fireworks from both installations can overlap in time, and the code does not account for this overlap.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, which involves considering the visibility intervals of fireworks from both installations and finding the maximum overlap. This requires more complex calculations, such as using the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the cycle in which fireworks from both installations are launched and then determining the maximum overlap within that cycle.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
