Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is part of the initial state).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the input.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(A + B)
```

### Explanation:
- `A` is calculated as the integer division of `m` by `a`, plus 1. This means `A = int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is calculated as the integer division of `m` by `b`, plus 1. This means `B = int(m / b) + 1`.
- The `print` statement will output the sum of `A` and `B`.

### Output:
The output will be the sum of `A` and `B`, where `A` is `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.

Output: **int(m / a) + 1 + int(m / b) + 1 (where A = int(m / a) + 1 and B = int(m / b) + 1)**

To simplify, the output can be described as:
Output: **int(m / a) + int(m / b) + 2**
