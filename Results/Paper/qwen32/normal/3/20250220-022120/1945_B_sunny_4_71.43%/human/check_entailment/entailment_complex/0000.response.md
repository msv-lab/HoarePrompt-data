Reasoning:  
The provided program calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation independently and sums them up. However, it does not account for the overlap in the visibility times of fireworks from both installations. The key issue lies in the fact that fireworks from both installations can be visible at the same time, and the current implementation does not handle this overlap correctly.

For example, if `a = 3`, `b = 4`, and `m = 10`, the fireworks from the first installation will be visible at times `[0, 3, 6, 9]` with each lasting `11` minutes, and the fireworks from the second installation will be visible at times `[0, 4, 8]` with each lasting `11` minutes. The correct answer should consider the overlap at times like `0`, `3`, `4`, `6`, `8`, `9`, and `10` where multiple fireworks could be visible simultaneously.

The current implementation simply adds the number of fireworks from each installation without considering the overlap, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
