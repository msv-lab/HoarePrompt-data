The only variable in the loop head is `_` (an underscore), which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use inside the loop. The loop will execute `t` times, and after each iteration, `_` is incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are each integers between 1 and 10^18.
- `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.

Since `_` is not used in the loop body, its value is irrelevant to the computation of `A` and `B`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, but this does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, or `B`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `_` has been incremented by 1, but `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `m` are each integers between 1 and 10^18; `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`**
