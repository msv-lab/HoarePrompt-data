The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need any specific state before the loop starts. Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, `m` are each integers between 1 and 10^18**
