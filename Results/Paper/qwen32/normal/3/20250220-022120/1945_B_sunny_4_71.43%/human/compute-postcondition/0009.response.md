The code snippet assigns a new value to `B` based on the integer division of `m` by `b` and then adds 1. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `A` also remains unchanged as it is calculated before the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers provided by the input; `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.**
