### Reasoning:

The code provided seems to have a logical flaw in its implementation, which causes it to produce incorrect results. Let's break down the issues step by step.

1. **Default Value Function**: The code references a function `default_value` which is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This would cause a `NameError` if the code were actually run. However, for the sake of this analysis, let's assume that `default_value` is a function that returns 0 (as suggested by the `func_1` function which is not used).

2. **Logic for Calculating Additional Problems**: The main issue is in the logic used to calculate the number of additional problems needed. The code iterates over the keys in the dictionary `d` and checks if the count of any difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, it adds the difference `m - d[val]` to `ans`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').

3. **Required Problems per Round**: For each round, Vlad needs exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). Therefore, for `m` rounds, he needs `m` problems of each difficulty level. The code should check if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and, if so, add the difference `m - d[val]` to `ans`.

4. **Correct Calculation**: The correct approach would be to initialize `ans` to `0` and then iterate over all possible difficulty levels ('A' to 'G'). For each level, if the count of problems of that level is less than `m`, add the difference `m - d[val]` to `ans`. This ensures that Vlad has enough problems of each required difficulty level for all `m` rounds.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
