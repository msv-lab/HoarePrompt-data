The code snippet `s = list(input())` takes an input string and converts it into a list of its characters. Given the initial state, `s` was a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. After the execution of the code, `s` is now a list of these characters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; For each of the t test cases, `s` is a list of characters consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with 1 <= len(s) <= 5000. The total length of all lists `s` over all test cases does not exceed 5000.**
