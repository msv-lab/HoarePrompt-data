Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. If `count` is not equal to `j` + 1, then `count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0. If `count` equals `j`, the program returns nothing (None).**
