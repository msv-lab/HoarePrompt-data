Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`, `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where `2 <= n <= 5000`, `n` is the length of `s`, `j` is an integer such that `0 <= j < n`, `k` is `k + 1`, `count` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `count` has been reset to 0. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `j`, and `k`) retain their initial values.
