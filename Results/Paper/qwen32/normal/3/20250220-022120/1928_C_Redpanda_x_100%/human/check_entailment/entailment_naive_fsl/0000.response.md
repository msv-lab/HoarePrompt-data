Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not appear to correctly solve the problem described. The given code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `generate`, but it does not directly address the problem of finding the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position and number.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to be trying to factorize a number `n` and generate factors, but it does not use the factorization results in a meaningful way to solve the problem.
   - The function does not take into account the position `n` and the number `x` that Vasya received.
   - The function `generate` is called within `func_1`, but it doesn't seem to contribute to solving the problem either.

2. **Function `generate`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate factors based on the prime factorization of `n` from `func_1`, but it doesn't use the factors to determine the valid `k` values.
   - The function yields factors, but it does not relate these factors to the problem's requirements.

3. **Lack of Implementation for Problem Requirements**:
   - The core of the problem requires finding the number of `k` values such that Vasya's position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the described settling pattern.
   - The provided code does not implement any logic to determine the valid `k` values based on `n` and `x`.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - The code does not produce any output that matches the expected results for the given example test cases.
   - For example, for the input `10 2`, the expected output is `4`, but the provided code does not output anything.

Given these points, it is clear that the provided code is not solving the problem as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
