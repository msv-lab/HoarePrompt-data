The code snippet provided is a `yield` statement, which is used in the context of a generator function. When a `yield` statement is encountered, the function's execution is paused and the yielded value is returned to the caller. However, the function retains its state to be resumed later.

Given the initial state, the `yield` statement will return the value `1` to the caller, but it does not change the values of the variables `k`, `n`, `x`, or the list `primes`. The state of the variables remains the same as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, and `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < n. Additionally, `k` equals the length of the list `primes`. A value `1` has been yielded.**
