Postcondition: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, and `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < n. If `k` equals the length of the list `primes`, a value `1` has been yielded. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is a list with at least one element, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, and `factors` is a dictionary containing the key `prime` with a non-negative integer value.**
