The code snippet `yield factor * prime_to_i` does not change the values of any variables directly. Instead, it yields a value, which means it produces a value that can be iterated over in a generator function context. This does not affect the state of the variables in the function itself.

Thus, the values of `k`, `n`, `x`, `primes`, `rest`, `prime`, `prime_to_i`, and `factors` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the expression `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is a list with at least one element, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, `prime_to_i` is 1, `factors` is a dictionary containing the key `prime` with a non-negative integer value, and `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**
