The provided Python code snippet only includes a type variable declaration `T = TypeVar('T')`, which does not affect any of the initial state variables `n`, `v`, or `p`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `v`, and `p` remain unchanged after the execution of this code.

Output State: **Each test case consists of three parts: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of mushrooms, a list v of size n (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9) representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
