Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is the same integer input by the user, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `b` is the new list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `i` is the count of elements in `a` that have been compared and found to be less than or equal to elements in `b` (or `n` if all elements in `a` have been compared), `j` is `n`**

In natural language, the variable `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
