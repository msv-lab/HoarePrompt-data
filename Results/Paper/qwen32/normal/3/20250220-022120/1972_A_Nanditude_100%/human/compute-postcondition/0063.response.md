The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers input by the user, `j` is 1, and `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `b[j] < a[i]`, then `cnt` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2 and `cnt` is either 0 or 1. Now, `i` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers input by the user, `j` is 1, `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
