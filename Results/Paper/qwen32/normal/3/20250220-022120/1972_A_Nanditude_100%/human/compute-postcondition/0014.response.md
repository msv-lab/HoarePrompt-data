Output State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), `j` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The variable `cnt` is increased by 1.
