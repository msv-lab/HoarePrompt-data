The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.
