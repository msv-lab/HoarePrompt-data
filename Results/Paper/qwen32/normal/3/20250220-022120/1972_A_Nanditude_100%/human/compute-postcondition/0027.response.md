The code snippet provided resets the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`). Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), `cnt` is 0, `i` is the count of elements in `a` that have been matched or exceeded by elements in `b`.**
