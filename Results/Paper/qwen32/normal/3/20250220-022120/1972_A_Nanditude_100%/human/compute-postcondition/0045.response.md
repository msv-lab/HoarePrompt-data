The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, as it is the only one that controls the number of iterations. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` was `t - 1`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `t` by 1 so that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is the same integer input by the user, `a` is the same list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is the same list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`, `i` is the count of elements in `a` that have been compared and found to be less than or equal to elements in `b` (or `n` if all elements in `a` have been compared), `j` is `n`**
