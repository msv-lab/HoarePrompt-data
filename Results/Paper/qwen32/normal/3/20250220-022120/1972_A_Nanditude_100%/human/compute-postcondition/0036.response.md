The code snippet provided is `cnt += 1`, which increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1` (This seems to be a description or a placeholder rather than a specific value, so we will keep it as is)
- `n` is a new integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
- `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user
- `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9)
- If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 1`

After executing `cnt += 1`, the value of `cnt` will be incremented by 1 from its initial state. Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), `cnt` is incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged**.
