t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. The array a consists of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. The string s consists of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
