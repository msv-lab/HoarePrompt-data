The code snippet provided is `ans *= i`. This means that the variable `ans` will be updated to its current value multiplied by `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, and `res` are not affected by this operation. The only change is to `ans`, which will now hold the product of its previous value and `i`.

Given the initial state, `ans` is described as "the next element in `arr` after the last processed element." So, after the operation, `ans` will be `ans * i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is the next element in `arr` after the last processed element, multiplied by `i`.**
