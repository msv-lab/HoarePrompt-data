The code snippet provided is `l += 1`, which increments the value of `l` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the value of `l` is not explicitly mentioned, but we know that it is used in the context of the array `arr` and the variable `ans`. Since `l` is incremented, its new value will be its previous value plus one.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is at least 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, the third element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the fourth element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0; `c` is 3; `k` is 3; `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`; `l` is incremented by 1.**
