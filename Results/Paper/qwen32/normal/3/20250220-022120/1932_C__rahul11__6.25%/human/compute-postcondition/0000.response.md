The provided code snippet only defines a constant `MOD` and does not modify any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`). Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. The new variable `MOD` is introduced with the value `10 ** 9 + 6`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each i; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5; `MOD` is 1000000006.**
