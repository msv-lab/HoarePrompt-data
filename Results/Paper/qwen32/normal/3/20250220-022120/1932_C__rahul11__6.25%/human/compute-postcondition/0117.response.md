Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is at least 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros, with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[l]` modulo `MOD`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; the current character at index `k` in `s` is 'L'**

In simple terms, the value at index 1 of the list `res` is now updated to be the same as the value at index 0, which is `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
