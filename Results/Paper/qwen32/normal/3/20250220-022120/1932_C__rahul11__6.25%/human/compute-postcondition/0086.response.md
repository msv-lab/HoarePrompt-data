The only variable in the loop head is `k`. Therefore, we need to adjust only `k` for the loop to execute one more time. According to the loop statement, `k` iterates from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by `1` to `3`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is at least 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, the third element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0; `c` is 3; `k` is 3.**
