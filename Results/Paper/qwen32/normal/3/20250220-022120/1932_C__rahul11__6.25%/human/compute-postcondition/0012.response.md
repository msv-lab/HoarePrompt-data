The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `ans` by the variable `i`. Given the initial state, `ans` is the next element in `arr` after the last processed element, multiplied by `i`. After the execution of `ans *= i`, `ans` will be the result of this multiplication.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is the next element in `arr` after the last processed element, multiplied by `i` and then multiplied by `i` again; `i` is the next element in `arr` after the last processed element.**
