Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', then `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[l]` modulo `MOD` and `l` is updated to 1, while `r` remains `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]` modulo `MOD` and `r` is updated to `n - 2`, while `l` remains 0. `c` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 3, `k` is incremented by 1. If `s[k]` was 'L', then `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is `i + 1`. If `s[k] == 'L'`, then `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` is `l + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, and `r` is decreased by 1. `c` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
