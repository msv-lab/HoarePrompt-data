Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is at least 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the last element, then divided by `arr[r]` and taken modulo `MOD`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n-2`; `s[k]` is not equal to 'L'**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, so it is now `n-2` instead of `n-1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
