Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a critical flaw in how it updates the product of the array elements (`ans`) when removing elements based on the commands. Specifically, the program uses integer division (`//`) to update the product, which is incorrect because the product of integers should be updated by multiplying or dividing by the exact values, not by using integer division. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when the product is not perfectly divisible by the element being removed.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2
2 2 2
RRR
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 0 0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0 0 1
```

**Explanation of the Issue:**
1. The initial product is `2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.
2. The remainder when divided by 2 is `0`.
3. The first command is 'R', so the rightmost element (2) is removed. The product should be `8 // 2 = 4`, and the remainder when divided by 2 is `0`.
4. The second command is 'R', so the new rightmost element (2) is removed. The product should be `4 // 2 = 2`, and the remainder when divided by 2 is `0`.
5. The third command is 'R', so the new rightmost element (2) is removed. The product should be `2 // 2 = 1`, and the remainder when divided by 2 is `1`.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the product using integer division, leading to the incorrect output of `0 0 1`.

To fix this, the program should maintain the product correctly by multiplying and dividing by the exact values without using integer division. Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], -1, m)) % m  # Use modular multiplicative inverse
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], -1, m)) % m  # Use modular multiplicative inverse
                r -= 1
            res[c] = ans
            c += 1
        print(*res)
```

In this corrected version, the modular multiplicative inverse is used to correctly divide the product by the element being removed. This ensures that the product is updated correctly and the remainders are computed accurately.
