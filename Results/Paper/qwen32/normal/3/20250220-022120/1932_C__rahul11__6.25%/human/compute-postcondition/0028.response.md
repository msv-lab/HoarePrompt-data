Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', then `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[l]` modulo `MOD` and `l` is updated to 1, while `r` remains `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]` modulo `MOD` and `r` is updated to `n - 2`, while `l` remains 0. `c` is 2.**
