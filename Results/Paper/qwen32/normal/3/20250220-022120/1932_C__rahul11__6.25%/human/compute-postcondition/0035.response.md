The code snippet provided is `r -= 1`, which decrements the value of `r` by 1. 

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by this line of code is `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 2, `k` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is decremented by 1**.
