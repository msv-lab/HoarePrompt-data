Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `k` is 0.**

In this output state, the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n` retain their initial values as described. The variable `i` remains 0, and a new variable `k` is introduced with a value of 0.
