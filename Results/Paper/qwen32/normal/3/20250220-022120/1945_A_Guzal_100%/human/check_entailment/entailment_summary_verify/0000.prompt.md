You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `k` based on the conditions involving `b` and `c`. If `b` modulo 3 is not zero and the sum of `b` and `c` modulo 3 is less than 3, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as `a` plus the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3, and if the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, it increments `k` by 1. The function prints the calculated `k` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown
- **Introverts (a):** Each introvert wants a tent alone.
- **Extroverts (b):** Each extrovert wants a tent with exactly two others.
- **Universals (c):** Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other, or with two others.

The objective is to find the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. If it's impossible to satisfy everyone's preferences, output `-1`.

### Program Analysis
The given program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. **Input Reading:** It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
2. **Logic for Tents Calculation:**
   - If the number of extroverts `b` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of extroverts and universals `b + c` is less than 3, it prints `-1` (impossible to form a group of 3 with extroverts and universals).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents as `a + (b + c) // 3`.
   - If the sum of extroverts and universals `b + c` is not divisible by 3, it adds one more tent to accommodate the remaining participants.
