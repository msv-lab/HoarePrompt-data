Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal distribution of universals to satisfy the conditions for introverts and extroverts. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Handling Introverts:** The program correctly assigns one tent per introvert.
2. **Handling Extroverts:** The program correctly calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts, assuming that universals can be used to fill any remaining spots.
3. **Handling Universals:** The program does not optimally distribute universals to fill incomplete tents. It simply checks if the remaining people (after placing introverts and extroverts) can fill a tent, but it does not consider the possibility of using universals to complete tents that are partially filled by extroverts.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        k += a  # Each introvert needs a tent
        c -= min(c, 2 * b)  # Use universals to pair with extroverts
        b -= min(b, c // 2)  # Pair extroverts with universals
        c -= 2 * b  # After pairing, reduce the number of universals
        if b > 0:  # If there are still extroverts left
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += (c + 2) // 3  # Add tents for remaining universals
            print(k)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that universals are optimally used to pair with extroverts and fill any remaining spots in tents, and it correctly handles cases where it is impossible to satisfy all conditions.
