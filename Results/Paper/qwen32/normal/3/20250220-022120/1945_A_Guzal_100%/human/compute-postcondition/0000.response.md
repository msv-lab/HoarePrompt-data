The code provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Therefore, the value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided by the input. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**
