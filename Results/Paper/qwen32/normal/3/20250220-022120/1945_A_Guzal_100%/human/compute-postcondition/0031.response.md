Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 2. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is updated to the previous value of `k` plus `a + (b + c) // 3` plus 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, or plus `a + (b + c) // 3` if `(b + c) % 3 == 0`.**
