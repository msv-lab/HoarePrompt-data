The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is such that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, as `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop's requirements.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0**
