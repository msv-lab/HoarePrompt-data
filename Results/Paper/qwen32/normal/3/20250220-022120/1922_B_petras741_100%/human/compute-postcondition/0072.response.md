To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables. The loop iterates over the range `n + 1` and appends indices `j` to the list `eta` if `q[j] > 0`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`.
   - `buffer` is an empty list.
   - `w` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`.
   - `eta` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Body:**
   - For each `j` in the range `n + 1`, if `q[j] > 0`, append `j` to `eta`.

After all iterations, the loop will have checked all indices from `0` to `n`. Therefore, `eta` will contain all indices `j` for which `q[j] > 0`.

**Output State:**
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`.
- `buffer` remains an empty list.
- `w` remains a list of integers provided by the new input.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.
- `q` remains a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`.
- `eta` will contain all indices `j` (from `0` to `n`) for which `q[j] > 0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the new input; `i` is `i + 1`; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`; `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from `0` to `n`) for which `q[j] > 0`.**
