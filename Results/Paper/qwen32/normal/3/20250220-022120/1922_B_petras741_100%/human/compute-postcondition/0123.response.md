To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement.

The `print` statement in question is:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` is a formula to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of `n` elements, also known as the binomial coefficient \( C(n, 3) \).

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `eta_ln` (the length of the list `eta`) equals 1.

However, the value of `n` is not explicitly given in the initial state. The only information we have is that `n` is an integer and is at least 1. But to determine the exact output, we need the specific value of `n`.

Since the problem does not specify a particular value of `n`, we can only express the output in terms of `n`.

The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` will give us the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `n` elements. For example:
- If `n = 1`, the expression evaluates to `1 * (1 - 1) * (1 - 2) // 6 = 0`.
- If `n = 2`, the expression evaluates to `2 * (2 - 1) * (2 - 2) // 6 = 0`.
- If `n = 3`, the expression evaluates to `3 * (3 - 1) * (3 - 2) // 6 = 1`.
- If `n = 4`, the expression evaluates to `4 * (4 - 1) * (4 - 2) // 6 = 4`.
- If `n = 5`, the expression evaluates to `5 * (5 - 1) * (5 - 2) // 6 = 10`.

Given that `n` is at least 1, the output will be the result of the formula `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
