Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The program focuses on counting combinations of sticks with the same length and does not correctly apply the triangle inequality theorem, which is essential for determining if three sticks can form a triangle.

The triangle inequality theorem states that for three sticks of lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)), they can form a triangle if and only if \(a + b > c\). The given program does not check this condition.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The sticks have lengths \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^3 = 8\), and \(2^3 = 8\).
- Possible combinations of 3 sticks are: (2, 4, 8), (2, 4, 8), (2, 8, 8), (4, 8, 8).
- Only (2, 8, 8) and (4, 8, 8) satisfy the triangle inequality (since 2 + 8 > 8 and 4 + 8 > 8).

**Actual Output of Given Program:**
```
0
```

The program incorrectly calculates the number of ways to form a triangle, as it does not properly apply the triangle inequality theorem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
