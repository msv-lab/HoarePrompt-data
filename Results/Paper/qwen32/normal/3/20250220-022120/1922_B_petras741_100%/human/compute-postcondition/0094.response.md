Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the newly input integer, and `n` is less than 3; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the new input; the state of the variables remains unchanged as described in the precondition; `i` is `i + 1`.**
