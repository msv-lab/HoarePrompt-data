Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input; `i` is an integer; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`; `j` is updated to `n` if `eta_ln == 1` or `eta_ln - 1` otherwise; `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0; `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`; `rho` is `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln == 1`, otherwise `rho` is calculated as `q[eta[0]] + (eta_ln - 1) * q[eta[1]] + (eta_ln - 2) * q[eta[2]] + ... + 2 * q[eta[eta_ln - 2]] + q[eta[eta_ln - 1]]`. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `res` is the sum of the initial `res` and the contributions from each `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1` as described.**
