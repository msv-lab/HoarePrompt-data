Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input; `i` is an integer; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`; `j` is 1; `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0; `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and must be greater than 1; `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]`; `res` is initially `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` and has been updated to `res + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`.**

The value of `res` has been incremented by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
