Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the input; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers, where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `q` will have been updated such that for each element `w[j]` in the list `w`, the corresponding index in `q` will have been incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `buffer`) remain unchanged.
