The given code snippet increments the value of `res` by the result of the expression `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`. This means that the new value of `res` is the sum of its previous value and the newly computed term.

The other variables (`eta_ln`, `rho`, and `q[eta[0]]`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`**

In natural language: The length of `eta` (`eta_ln`) and the value of `rho` (which is `q[eta[0]]`) remain unchanged. The value of `res` is updated to include an additional term `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` added to its previous value.
