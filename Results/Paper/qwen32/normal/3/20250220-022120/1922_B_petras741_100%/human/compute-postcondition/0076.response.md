To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` based on the provided initial state.

The initial state tells us that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. However, it does not specify the exact value of `n`. The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` calculates the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `n` elements, which is a combinatorial formula \(\binom{n}{3}\).

Given that `eta_ln` (the length of `eta`) equals 1, it means there is exactly one index `j` in the list `q` for which `q[j] > 0`. However, this information does not directly affect the value of `n` or the expression being printed.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for the expression. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` will output the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `n` elements.

Thus, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
