The code snippet `rho += q[eta[j]]` modifies the value of `rho` by adding `q[eta[j]]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`
- `rho` is `rho + q[eta[j]]`
- `eta_ln` is greater than 1
- `res` is a specific formula involving `rho` and `q[eta[j]]`
- `j` is `j + 1`

After executing the code snippet, the new value of `rho` will be the old value of `rho` plus `q[eta[j]]`. Since the initial value of `rho` already includes `q[eta[j]]`, the new value of `rho` will be the old value of `rho` plus an additional `q[eta[j]]`.

Output State: **`eta_ln` is the length of `eta`; `rho` is `rho + 2 * q[eta[j]]`; `eta_ln` is greater than 1; `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`; `j` is `j + 1`.**
