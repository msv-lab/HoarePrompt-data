Output State: **`s` is a list of 30 elements where consecutive '1's pairs are replaced by '-1' and '0's following '-1' are flipped to '1', except the last element which is now '0'; `flag` is not 0; `length` is 30; `t` remains unchanged; `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration; `x` is the input integer.**

In simpler terms, the last element of the list `s` has been changed to '0', while all other elements and variables remain as they were initially described.
