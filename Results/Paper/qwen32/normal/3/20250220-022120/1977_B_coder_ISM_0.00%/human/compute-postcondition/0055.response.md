Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of 30 characters where `s[4]` is set to `'-1'` if `flag` is 0, `s[i] == s[i + 1]`, and `s[i] == '1'`, otherwise `s[4]` remains `'0'` if `flag` is 1 and `s[4]` is `'0'`, or `s` is updated such that each element is either `'1'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set; if `flag` is 1 and `s[5]` is `'0'`, then `s[5]` is specifically set to `'1'`; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1; `i` is 5.**

In simpler terms: **After the if-else block, `t` and `x` retain their initial values. The list `s` is modified based on the value of `flag`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[5]` is `'0'`, it is set to `'1'`. The length of `s` remains 30, and `flag` and `i` also retain their initial values.**
