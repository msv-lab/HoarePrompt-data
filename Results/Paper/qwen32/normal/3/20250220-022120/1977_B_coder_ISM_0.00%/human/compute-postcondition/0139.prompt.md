Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `s` contains 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `flag` is 0. The variable `length` remains unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 1. The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `s` contains 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `length` remains unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 1. The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `s[i]` is now '1'. If the condition `flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1')` is true, then `s[i]` is now `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains either 0 or 1, and the elements of `s` are unchanged except that if `flag` is 1, `s[i]` is specifically '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `s` contains 30 elements. If `flag` was 0 and `s[28]` was '1' and `s[29]` was '1', then `s[28]` is now '-1' and `flag` is now 1. Otherwise, `s[28]` is '0' if `flag` was 1 and `s[28]` was '1'; otherwise, `s[28]` remains unchanged. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `length` remains unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 1. The variable `x` is assigned the value from user input. The variable `i` is 28.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The list `s` contains 30 elements. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` equals `s[i + 1]` and both are '1', then the values of `flag`, `s[28]`, `s[29]`, `t`, `length`, `nalla`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` was '0' before the execution, then `flag` is set to 0, `nalla` is incremented by 1, `x` is assigned the value from user input, and `i` is set to 29. In all other cases, the values of `flag`, `s[28]`, `s[29]`, `t`, `length`, `nalla`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
