The code snippet `s.append('1')` adds the character '1' to the end of the list `s`. Given the initial state, `s` is a list of 30 characters where the last character `s[29]` is '0'. After appending '1', the list `s` will now have 31 characters, and the last character `s[30]` will be '1'.

The other variables (`t`, `x`, `length`, and `flag`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of 31 characters where the last character `s[30]` is '1'; `length` is 30; `flag` is not 0.**
