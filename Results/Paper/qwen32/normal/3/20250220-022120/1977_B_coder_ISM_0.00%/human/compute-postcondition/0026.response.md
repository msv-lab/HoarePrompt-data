Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of 30 characters, each being either `'1'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is `'0'`, then `s[i]` remains `'0'`. If `flag` is non-zero and `s[i]` is `'0'`, then `s[i]` is updated to `'1'`. `length` is 30; `flag` is 0.**
