You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < 2^30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        
        s = []
        
        length = 30
        
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:

        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'

        print(*s)
        
    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the list `s` will be transformed such that no consecutive `'-1'` and `'1'` pairs exist, and all `'-1'`s are moved to the leftmost positions, followed by `0`s, and then the rest of the elements, which will be either `0` or `1`. The variable `flag` will be either 0 or 1, and `length` will be either 30 or 31. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and `nalla` will have completed iterating through all `t` test cases. The variable `x` will be the input integer for the current test case being processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x < 2^30. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the value of `x`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
