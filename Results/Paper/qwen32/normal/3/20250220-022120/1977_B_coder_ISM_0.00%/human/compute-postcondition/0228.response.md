Output State: **`s` is a list of 31 elements where the first 30 elements follow the rule that consecutive '1's pairs are replaced by '-1' and '0's following '-1' are flipped to '1', except the last element which is now '0', and the 31st element is '1'; `flag` is not 0; `length` is 31; `t` remains unchanged; `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration; `x` is the input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `length` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 30 to 31. All other variables remain unchanged.
