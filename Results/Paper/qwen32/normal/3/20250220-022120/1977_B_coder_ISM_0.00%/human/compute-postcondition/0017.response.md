The code snippet provided appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Therefore, the list `s` will have an additional element `'0'` at the end. The values of the other variables (`t`, `x`, `length`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either `['1']` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or `['0']` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set, and now `s` has an additional element `'1'` at the end if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set, followed by an additional `'0'`; `length` is 30; `i` is 30**.
