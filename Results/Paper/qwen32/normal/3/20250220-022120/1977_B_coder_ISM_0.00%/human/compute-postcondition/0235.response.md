Postcondition: **`s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements following the specified rules. If `s[1]` is `'0'` and `s[0]` is `'-1'`, `flag` is set to 1 if it was initially 0 and `s[29]` was `'0'`; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged. `length` is 30 if `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not `'0'`; otherwise, `length` is 31. `t` remains unchanged. `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration. `x` is the input integer. `i` is 1.**
