Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements. If `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` was '0' before the execution, then `flag` is set to 0, `nalla` is incremented by 1, `x` is assigned the value from user input, and `i` is 29. Otherwise, the values of `flag`, `s[28]`, `s[29]`, `t`, `length`, `nalla`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
