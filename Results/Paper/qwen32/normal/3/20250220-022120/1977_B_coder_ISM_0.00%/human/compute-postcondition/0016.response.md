The code snippet `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the end of the list `s`. The initial state specifies that `s` already contains either `['1']` or `['0']` depending on the `i`-th bit of `x`, and now it has an additional element `'1'` or `'0'` at the end. After executing the code, the list `s` will have one more element `'1'` appended to it. The values of `t`, `x`, `length`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either `['1', '1']` or `['0', '1']` depending on the `i`-th bit of `x`; `length` is 30; `i` is 30**.
