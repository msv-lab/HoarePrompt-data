Postcondition: **`flag` is 1, `s` contains 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary digits of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. `length` remains 30, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29, `x` is the input integer, and `i` is 0. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
