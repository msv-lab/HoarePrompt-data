Postcondition: **The list `s` has transformed such that any sequence of consecutive '1's has the first '1' replaced by '-1' and subsequent '1's in that sequence are replaced by '0'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1'. If `flag` is not 1, and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` remains '0'. If `flag` is not 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', then `s[29]` is explicitly set to '0', and an additional '1' is appended to the list, `length` is incremented by 1, and `flag` remains non-zero. If `flag` is 0, no further changes are made to `s`, `length`, or `flag`. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 29. The variable `x` is assigned the value from user input.**
