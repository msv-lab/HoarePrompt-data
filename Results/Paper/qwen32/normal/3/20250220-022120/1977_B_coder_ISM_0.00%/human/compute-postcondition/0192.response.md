The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of the element at index `i` in the list `s` to the string `'-1'`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state provided.

Output State: **`s` contains 30 elements, with `s[i]` now being `'-1'` and the rest either '1' or '0', representing the binary digits of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit; `flag` is 0; `length` remains 30; `t` remains unchanged; `nalla` is incremented by 29; `x` is the input integer; `i` is 0; `s[i]` is `'-1'`; `s[i + 1]` is '1'.**
