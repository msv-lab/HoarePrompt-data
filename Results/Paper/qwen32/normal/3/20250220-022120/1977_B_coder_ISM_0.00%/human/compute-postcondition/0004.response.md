Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an empty list; `length` is 30.**

Explanation: The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a specific range, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is an empty list. The code snippet assigns the value 30 to the variable `length`. No other variables are affected.
