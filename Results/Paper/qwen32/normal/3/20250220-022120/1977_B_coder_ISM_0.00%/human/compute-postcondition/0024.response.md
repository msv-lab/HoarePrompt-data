The value of `s[i]` is changed from `'0'` to `'1'`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of 30 characters, each being either `'1'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, with `s[i]` now being `'1'`; `length` is 30; `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is `'1'` for the current index `i`.**
