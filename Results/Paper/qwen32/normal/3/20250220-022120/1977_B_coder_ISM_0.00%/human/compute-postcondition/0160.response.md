The code assigns the value `'-1'` to `s[i - 1]`. The precondition that `length` must be greater than `i + 1` and `s[i]` is `'0'` remains valid. The only change is the value of `s[i - 1]`, which is now `'-1'`.

Output State: **`length` must be greater than `i + 1`; `s[i]` is `'0'`; `s[i - 1]` is `'-1'`.**
