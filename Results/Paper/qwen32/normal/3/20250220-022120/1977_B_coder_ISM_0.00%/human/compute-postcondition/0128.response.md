Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements. If `flag` was 0 and `s[28]` was '1' and `s[29]` was '1', then `s[28]` is now '-1' and `flag` is now 1. Otherwise, `s[28]` is '0' if `flag` was 1 and `s[28]` was '1'; otherwise, `s[28]` remains unchanged. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `length` remains unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 1. The variable `x` is assigned the value from user input. The variable `i` is 28.**
