The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper bound `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it 6, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 6.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` must be greater than or equal to 6; `j` is 6**
