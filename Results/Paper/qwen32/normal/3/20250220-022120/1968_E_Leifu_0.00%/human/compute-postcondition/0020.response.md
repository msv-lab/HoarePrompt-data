Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
2. `n` is a new input integer.
3. If the new `n` is 3, `j` remains unchanged.
4. If the new `n` is greater than 3, `j` is `n` + 1.
5. `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 2')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('1 2')`.
- This statement directly prints the string `'1 2'` to the console.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `j`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement since it is printing a hardcoded string.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'1 2'`.

Output: **1 2**
