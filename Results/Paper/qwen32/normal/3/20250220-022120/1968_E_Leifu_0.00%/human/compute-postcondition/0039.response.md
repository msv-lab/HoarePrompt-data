The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 (which is not relevant to the loop head), `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `j` would have taken the value 4 in the previous iteration (since the range starts from 4).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `j` is 5**
