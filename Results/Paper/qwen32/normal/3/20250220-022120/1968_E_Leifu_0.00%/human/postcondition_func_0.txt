The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a series of pairs of integers according to specific rules. It prints '1 1', '1 2', and then either '2 3' if `n` is 3, or '2 4' followed by each integer from 4 to `n` printed twice on its respective line if `n` is greater than 3.
