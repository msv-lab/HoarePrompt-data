Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement provided:

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- `i` is 3.

**Python Code Snippet:**
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

**Analysis:**
- The print statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and the string representation of `j` again.
- The variable `j` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact value of `j` from the given information.

Since `j` is not defined, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the output. However, we can describe the output in terms of `j`.

**Output Description:**
The print statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and the string representation of `j` again. Therefore, the output will be `j j` where `j` is the value of the variable `j`.

Output: **j j (where j is the value of the variable j)**
