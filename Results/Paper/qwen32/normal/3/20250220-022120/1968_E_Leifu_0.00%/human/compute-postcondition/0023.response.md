To determine the state needed for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n` in this case. The loop will execute if the range `(4, n + 1)` is non-empty, meaning `n` must be at least 4. 

Given the conditions:
- If `n` is 3, `j` remains unchanged.
- If `n` is greater than 3, `j` is set to `n + 1`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but `i` is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Let's determine the necessary state:

1. **`n` must be at least 4** for the loop to execute. This ensures that the range `(4, n + 1)` is non-empty.
2. **`j`** can be any value before the loop starts, but according to the problem statement, if `n` is greater than 3, `j` will be set to `n + 1` at the start of the loop. However, since we are only adjusting the state before the loop starts, the value of `j` doesn't need to be specifically set to `n + 1` if `n` is greater than 3, but it must be consistent with the conditions provided.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
- `t` can remain as an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50 (it doesn't affect the loop execution).
- `n` must be at least 4.
- `j` can be any value, but it is typically considered as it would be set to `n + 1` once the loop starts if `n` is greater than 3.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `n` is at least 4, `j` can be any integer**
