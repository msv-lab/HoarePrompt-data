Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the program prints '1 1', '1 2', and then either '2 3' if `n` is 3, or '2 4' followed by each integer from 4 to `n` printed twice on its respective line if `n` is greater than 3.**

In simpler terms, the program will have completed all `t` test cases. For each test case:
- It prints '1 1' and '1 2'.
- If `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'.
- If `n` is greater than 3, it prints '2 4' and then prints each integer from 4 to `n` on a new line, with each integer appearing twice on that line.
