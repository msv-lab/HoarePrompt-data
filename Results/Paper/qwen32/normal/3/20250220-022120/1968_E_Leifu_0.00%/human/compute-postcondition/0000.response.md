Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.**

The value of `t` is now an integer input by the user, within the specified range. The condition for `n` remains unchanged as it is a precondition for each of the `t` test cases.
