To determine the output of the `print(2 + m // a)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State:
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\).
- If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `m < a and m < b`.
- Otherwise, either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not less than `b` (or both).
- `i` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the `print` statement.

### Analysis:
The `print` statement is `print(2 + m // a)`. To determine what this prints, we need to understand the value of `m // a`.

- `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, which means it gives the largest integer `k` such that \(k \times a \leq m\).

Given the range of `m` and `a`, we can have different scenarios:
1. If `m < a`, then `m // a` is 0.
2. If `m >= a`, then `m // a` is some integer greater than or equal to 1.

### Output Calculation:
- If `m < a`, then `m // a` is 0, so `2 + m // a` is `2 + 0 = 2`.
- If `m >= a`, then `m // a` is some integer `k`, so `2 + m // a` is `2 + k`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be `2 + m // a`, where `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`.

Output: **2 + m // a (where m // a is the integer division of m by a)**
