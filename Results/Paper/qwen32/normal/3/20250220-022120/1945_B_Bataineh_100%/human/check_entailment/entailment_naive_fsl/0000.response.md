Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The logic in the program is too simplistic and does not account for the actual overlap of fireworks' visibility periods.

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem requirements:

The problem requires calculating the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time, considering the intervals at which fireworks are launched and the duration they remain visible. The current code only considers the number of intervals that fit within `m` for each installation and adds a constant value, which is incorrect.

Here's why the code is incorrect:
- The code does not take into account the actual overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks from both installations.
- The logic `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect because it does not consider the exact overlap of the visibility periods. For example, if `a` and `b` are very close, the fireworks could overlap significantly more than what this formula suggests.
- The cases `m < a and m < b`, `m < a and m > b`, and `m < b and m > a` are not correctly handling the overlap of fireworks.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculate the number of fireworks launched within a common period that overlaps. This involves more complex calculations to determine the exact overlap of the visibility intervals.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    while(y):
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 0
        for t in range(lcm_ab):
            count = (m - t) // a + 1 if (m - t) % a == 0 else (m - t) // a
            count += (m - t) // b + 1 if (m - t) % b == 0 else (m - t) // b
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, count)
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time by iterating through the least common multiple of `a` and `b` and counting the fireworks launched within each period that overlap. This ensures that we correctly account for the actual overlap of visibility periods.
