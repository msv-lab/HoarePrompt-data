Reasoning: The given program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic provided in the program does not take into account the overlap of fireworks from both installations, which is critical for solving the problem. The conditions and calculations in the program are incorrect and do not address the core issue of finding the maximum overlap of visible fireworks.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible at the same time. This involves calculating the number of fireworks launched by each installation within a certain interval and considering the overlap of their visibility periods.

Here's a correct approach to solve the problem:
1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of the combined launches.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within one LCM period.
3. Calculate the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations within one LCM period.
4. The result is the sum of fireworks from both installations minus the overlap.

The provided program's logic is oversimplified and does not handle the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **False**
