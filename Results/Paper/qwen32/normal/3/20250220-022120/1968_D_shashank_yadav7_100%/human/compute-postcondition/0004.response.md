The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts those components to integers, and stores them in a list `a`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers read from the input, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
