Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 2; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `k` is an input integer minus 3; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `3 * a[s]`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `sm` is the maximum of `(a[s] - 1) * (k + 2)`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + (a[s] - 1)`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + 2 * a[s]`, and `a[s] * k + sp`; `bm` is the maximum of `max(a[b] * (k + 2), a[b] * (k + 1) + bp - a[b])`, `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, and `a[b] * k + bp`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input. If `k` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The value of `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions.
