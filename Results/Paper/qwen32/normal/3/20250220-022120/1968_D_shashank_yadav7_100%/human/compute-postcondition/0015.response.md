Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 1 from its initial value, `b` and `s` are integers read from the input with each decremented by 1, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, and `sm` is `a[s] * k`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
