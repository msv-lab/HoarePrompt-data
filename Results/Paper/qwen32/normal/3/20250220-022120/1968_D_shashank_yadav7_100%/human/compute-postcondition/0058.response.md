The code snippet `sp = a[s]` assigns the value of the element at index `s` in the list `a` to the variable `sp`. This means that `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`.

Here is the updated output state:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `n`; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer minus 1; `s` is an input integer minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration; and `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input.**
