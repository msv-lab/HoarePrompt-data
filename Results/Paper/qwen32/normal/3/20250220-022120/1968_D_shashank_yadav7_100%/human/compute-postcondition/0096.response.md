To determine what will be printed by the `print('Bodya')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the context of the variables.

### Given Information:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is defined as `min(n, k) - 1`.
3. `n` and `k` are input integers.
4. `b` is derived by repeatedly applying a transformation defined by the list `p` a total of `min(n, k)` times, starting from an initial value `b`.
5. `s` is similarly derived by repeatedly applying the same transformation defined by the list `p` a total of `min(n, k)` times, starting from an initial value `s`.
6. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
7. `sp` is calculated as `a[s] * (min(n, k) + 1)`.
8. `bp` is calculated as `a[b] * (min(n, k) + 1)`.
9. `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` computed across iterations.
10. `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` computed across iterations.
11. `p` is a list of integers read from the input.
12. It is given that `bm` is greater than `sm`.

### Analysis:
The `print('Bodya')` statement is a direct output statement that prints the string "Bodya". The value of `bm` being greater than `sm` is a condition given in the initial state, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement itself.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is simply outputting the string "Bodya" without any dependency on the values of `bm`, `sm`, or any other variables, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Bodya**
