The code snippet provided increments the variable `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. Therefore, the new value of `sp` will be the sum of its previous value and `a[s]`.

Given the initial state, the value of `sp` was `2 * a[s]`. After the execution of the code, `sp` becomes `2 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[s]`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Thus, the output state remains the same for all other variables as provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s])`, `bm` is `max(a[b], max(0, bp))`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
