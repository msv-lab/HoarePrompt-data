The code snippet `bm = a[b] * k` multiplies the element at index `b` in the list `a` by the integer `k` and assigns the result to the variable `bm`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers read from the input with `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is decremented by 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`.**
