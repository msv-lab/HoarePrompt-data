To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the changes in the variables `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` as the loop progresses.

### Observations from the Given Outputs:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `i` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration.
   - `k` starts at a certain value and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0, at which point the loop breaks.
   - `b` and `s` are initially set to specific values and then updated based on the `p` list.
   - `sp` starts as `a[s]` and accumulates the sum of `a[s]` in each iteration.
   - `bp` starts as `a[b]` and accumulates the sum of `a[b]` in each iteration.
   - `bm` and `sm` are updated to the maximum of their current value and a new calculated value in each iteration.

2. **Output State after 1 Iteration:**
   - `k` is decremented by 1.
   - `b` and `s` are updated to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, respectively.
   - `sp` becomes `2 * a[s]`.
   - `bp` becomes `2 * a[b]`.
   - `bm` and `sm` are updated to the maximum of their current value and a new calculated value.

3. **Output State after 2 Iterations:**
   - `k` is decremented by 2.
   - `b` and `s` are updated to `p[p[b] - 1] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, respectively.
   - `sp` becomes `3 * a[s]`.
   - `bp` becomes `3 * a[b]`.
   - `bm` and `sm` are updated to the maximum of their current value and a new calculated value.

4. **Output State after 3 Iterations:**
   - `k` is decremented by 3.
   - `b` and `s` are updated to `p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1` and `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, respectively.
   - `sp` becomes `4 * a[s]`.
   - `bp` becomes `4 * a[b]`.
   - `bm` and `sm` are updated to the maximum of their current value and a new calculated value.

### General Pattern:

- `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes all `n` iterations.
- `k` will be `0` if the loop completes all `n` iterations.
- `b` and `s` will be updated based on the `p` list in each iteration.
- `sp` will be the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
- `bp` will be the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
- `bm` and `sm` will be the maximum values calculated in each iteration.

### Final Output State:

The loop will terminate when `k` reaches 0. Therefore, if the loop completes all `n` iterations, the final state will be:

- `i` will be `n-1`.
- `k` will be `0`.
- `b` and `s` will be updated based on the `p` list in each iteration.
- `sp` will be the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
- `bp` will be the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
- `bm` and `sm` will be the maximum values calculated in each iteration.

Given the pattern, the final state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `n-1`; `n` is the number of iterations; `k` is 0; `b` is `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1` (nested `p` operations `n` times); `s` is `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1` (nested `p` operations `n` times); `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.**

In natural language, the loop will execute `n` times, decrementing `k` by 1 each time until `k` reaches 0. The variables `b` and `s` will be updated based on the `p` list, and `sp` and `bp` will accumulate the sums of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The variables `bm` and `sm` will store the maximum values calculated during the loop.
