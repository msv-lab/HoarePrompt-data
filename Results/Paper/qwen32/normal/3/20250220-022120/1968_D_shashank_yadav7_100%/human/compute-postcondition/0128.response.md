Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s]`, `bm` is `max(0, bp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Since the `if` condition `k == 0` is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
