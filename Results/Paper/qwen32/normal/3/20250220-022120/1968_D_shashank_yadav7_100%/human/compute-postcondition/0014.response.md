Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` and `s` are integers read from the input with `b` and `s` each decremented by 1, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, and `sm` is `a[s] * k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all variables remain unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
