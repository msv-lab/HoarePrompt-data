The code snippet provided is `sp += a[s]`. This means that the current value of `sp` is updated by adding the value of `a[s]` to it.

Given the initial state, `sp` is initially set to `a[s]`. After executing the code, `sp` becomes `a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[s]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 1 from its initial value; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `max(a[s] * k, a[s] * k + sp)`; If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
