The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. Given the initial state, `sp` was initially set to `a[s]`. After the execution of the code, `sp` will be `a[s] + a[s]`, which is `2 * a[s]`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s]`, `bm` is `max(0, bp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
