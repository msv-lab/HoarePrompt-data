The code snippet provided is:
```
sp += a[s]
```

This line of code adds the value of `a[s]` to the current value of `sp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2
- `k` is an input integer minus 3
- `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input
- `sp` is `3 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `3 * a[b]`
- `sm` is the maximum of `(a[s] - 1) * (k + 2)`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + (a[s] - 1)`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + 2 * a[s]`, and `a[s] * k + sp`
- `bm` is the maximum of `max(a[b] * (k + 2), a[b] * (k + 1) + bp - a[b])`, `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, and `a[b] * k + bp`
- `p` is a list of integers read from the input
- If `k` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

After executing `sp += a[s]`, the value of `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, which means `sp` is now `3 * a[s] + a[s]` or `4 * a[s]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 2; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `k` is an input integer minus 3; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `4 * a[s]`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `sm` is the maximum of `(a[s] - 1) * (k + 2)`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + (a[s] - 1)`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + 2 * a[s]`, and `a[s] * k + sp`; `bm` is the maximum of `max(a[b] * (k + 2), a[b] * (k + 1) + bp - a[b])`, `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, and `a[b] * k + bp`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; If `k` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
