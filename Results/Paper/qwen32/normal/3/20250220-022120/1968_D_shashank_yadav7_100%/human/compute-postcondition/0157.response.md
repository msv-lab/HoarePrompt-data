Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists `p` and `a` of length `n`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs. Specifically, if the conditions are met, it performs certain calculations and returns a value; otherwise, it may handle errors or return a specific message.**
