The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 1 from its initial value; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]` (or `2 * a[b]`); `bm` is `max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `max(a[s] * k, a[s] * k + sp)`; If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
