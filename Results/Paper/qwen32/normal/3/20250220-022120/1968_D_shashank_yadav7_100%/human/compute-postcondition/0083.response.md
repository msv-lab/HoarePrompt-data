The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those for the next iteration of the loop. According to the `for` loop statement, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 2; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `k` is an input integer minus 2; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `3 * a[s]`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `sm` is the maximum of `(a[s] - 1) * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * k + (a[s] - 1)` and `a[s] * k + 2 * a[s]`; `bm` is the maximum of `max(a[b] * (k + 1), a[b] * k + bp - a[b])` and `a[b] * k + bp`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input. If `k` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
