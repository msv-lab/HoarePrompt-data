The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1` and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. 

Since `i` is `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `n` at the start of the next iteration. The value of `t` remains the same because it defines the total number of iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `n`; `n` is the number of iterations; `k` is 0; `b` is `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1` (nested `p` operations `n` times); `s` is `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1` (nested `p` operations `n` times); `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration; and `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.**
