The code snippet assigns the value of `a[s] * k` to `sm`. Given that `sp` is `a[s]`, the new value of `sm` is `sp * k`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `n`; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer minus 1; `s` is an input integer minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b] * k`; `sm` is `sp * k`; `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input.**
