Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n, k)`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 (as per the if condition), `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s] * k` (which is 0 because `k` is 0), `bm` is `a[b] * k` (which is 0 because `k` is 0), `p` is a list of integers read from the input. Since `bm` and `sm` are both 0, the condition `bm > sm` is not applicable, but it is known that `bm` is not greater than `sm`.**
