The code snippet provided updates the values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` by reading a new pair of integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, `best`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are new integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the smallest total cost encountered that includes the cost of switching at a position less than or equal to `pos_final`, `c` is now the next integer in the range(cases)**

In simpler terms, `na_frente` and `pos_final` have been updated to new values from the input, while all other variables retain their previous values.
