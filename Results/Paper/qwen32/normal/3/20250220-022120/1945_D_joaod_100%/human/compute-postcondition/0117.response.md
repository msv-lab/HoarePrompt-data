Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, `c` is `c + 1`, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
