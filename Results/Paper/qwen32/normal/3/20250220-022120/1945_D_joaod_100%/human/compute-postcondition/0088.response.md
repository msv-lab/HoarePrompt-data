The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The output state will reflect the updated value of `total`.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the next integer in the range(cases), `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is greater than or equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it was updated, otherwise `best` remains unchanged.**
