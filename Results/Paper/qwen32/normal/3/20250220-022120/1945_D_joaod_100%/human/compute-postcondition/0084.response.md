The only variable in the loop head is `v`. According to the loop statement, `v` is iterated from `na_frente` down to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `v` is `na_frente - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` needs to be decremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `na_frente` is at least 1
- `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `c` is the next integer in the range(cases)
- `v` is `na_frente - 1`

At the start of the next iteration, `v` should be `na_frente - 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the next integer in the range(cases), `v` is `na_frente - 2`**
