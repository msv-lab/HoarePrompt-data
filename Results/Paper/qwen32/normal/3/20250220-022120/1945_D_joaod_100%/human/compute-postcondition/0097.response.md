The code snippet provided updates the values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` by reading new integer inputs. The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, `best`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the new input, `pos_final` is the second integer from the new input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` down to `0`, `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` that are less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `c` is `c + 1`.**
