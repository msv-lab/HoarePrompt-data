The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c` and `cases`. If `c` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the next integer in the range `cases`, which means `c` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` must still be less than `cases`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` down to `0`, `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` that are less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `c` is the next integer in the range(cases) such that `c` is less than `cases`.**

Since `c` is incremented in each iteration, we adjust `c` to be the next integer in the range, which is `c + 1` from the previous state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` down to `0`, `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` that are less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `c` is `c + 1`.**
