The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the `answers` list. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `answers` list has a new element `'Draw'` appended to it.**
