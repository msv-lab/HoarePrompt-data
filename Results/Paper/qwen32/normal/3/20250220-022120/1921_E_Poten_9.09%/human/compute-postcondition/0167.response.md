The provided initial state describes a list named `answers` that contains results for `t` test cases, with each result being either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'. However, the print statement in the code snippet is `print(j)`, which references a variable `j` that is not mentioned in the initial state.

Since `j` is not defined or mentioned in the initial state, its value is unknown based on the given information. Therefore, it is impossible to determine exactly what will be printed without additional context or definition of `j`.

Given the constraints and the information provided, the most precise description we can provide is that the print statement will output the value of `j`, but we do not know what that value is.

Output: **j (where j is an undefined variable)**
