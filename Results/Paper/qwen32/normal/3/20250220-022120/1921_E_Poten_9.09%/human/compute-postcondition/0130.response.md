The code snippet appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. No other variables are modified. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, and `i` is `i + 1`. Since the code only modifies `answers`, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Bob'`.**
