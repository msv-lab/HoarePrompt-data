Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1`, then if `clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, `answers` is updated to include `'Draw'`. Otherwise, `answers` is updated to include `'Bob'`. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1`, then if `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, `answers` is updated to include `'Draw'`. Otherwise, `answers` is updated to include `'Bob'`.**
