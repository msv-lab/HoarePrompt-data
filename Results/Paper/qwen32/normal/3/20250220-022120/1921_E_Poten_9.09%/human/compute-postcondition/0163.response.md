Output State: **`answers` is a list containing the result for each of the `t` test cases, where each result is either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' based on the conditions specified in the loop.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `answers` list will contain a result for each test case. Each result indicates the winner of the game ('Alice' or 'Bob') or if the game is a draw ('Draw'), based on the specific conditions checked within the loop for each set of input values. The number of results in the `answers` list will be equal to the initial value of `t`, representing the total number of test cases provided.
