To determine what will be printed by the `print(j)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `answers` is a list containing the result for each of the `t` test cases, where each result is either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.
- `answers` must have at least 1 element.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(j)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `j` is not defined in the given initial state. 
- The initial state provides information about the `answers` list but does not mention any variable `j`.

### Conclusion:
Since the variable `j` is not defined in the provided initial state, attempting to print `j` would result in a `NameError` because `j` is not recognized in the current scope.

### Output:
Given that `j` is not defined, the code will raise an error. However, the task is to determine what will be printed based on the precondition, and since `j` is not mentioned, we can infer that the output is undefined based on the provided information.

Output: **NameError: name 'j' is not defined**
