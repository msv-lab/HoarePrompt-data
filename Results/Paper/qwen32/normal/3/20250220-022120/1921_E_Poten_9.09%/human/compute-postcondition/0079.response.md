Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, and `clues[0]` is not equal to 1. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, `answers` is `['Bob']` if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`. If `clues[3]` does not equal `clues[5]`, `answers` is `['Draw']` if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and either `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2`. If the absolute difference is 1 or less, `answers` is `['Draw']` if `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. Otherwise, `answers` is `['Bob']`. If one of `clues[2]` or `clues[4]` is even while the other is odd, `answers` is `['Alice']` if `clues[3]` does not equal `clues[5]`. If `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, `answers` is `['Alice']`. If `clues[3]` does not equal `clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` minus 1 if the absolute difference is less than or equal to 1, `answers` is `['Alice']`. Otherwise, `answers` is `['Draw']`.**
