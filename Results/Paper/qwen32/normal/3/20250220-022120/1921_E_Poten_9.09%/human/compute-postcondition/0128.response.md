Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`. If `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` contains the string `'Draw'`. Otherwise, `answers` is a list with the new element `'Bob'` appended to it.**
