Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and conditions. The logic appears overly complex and contains multiple incorrect assumptions and conditions that do not align with the problem's requirements. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Misunderstanding of Movement Constraints**: The program does not correctly handle the movement constraints for both players. Alice can only move down, down-left, or down-right, while Bob can only move up, up-left, or up-right. The logic in the program seems to not fully account for these constraints, especially when determining the outcome of the game.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Column Position**: The logic for handling the column positions (`y_a` and `y_b`) seems flawed. The program does not correctly determine the relative positions of Alice and Bob in terms of columns and how this affects the game's outcome.

3. **Inconsistent Conditions**: The conditions for determining the winner or a draw are inconsistent and do not cover all possible scenarios. The program uses complex comparisons and conditions that do not directly correspond to the game's rules.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when Alice or Bob is in the last or first row, respectively, which should result in a draw.

5. **Optimal Play**: The program does not correctly simulate optimal play for both players. It does not account for the fact that both players will play optimally to win or draw the game.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game for all possible test cases, and thus, the correctness is **False**.
