The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `clues`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'`, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input, and the condition `clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1` is true.**
