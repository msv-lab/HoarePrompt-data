The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `mdx + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here are the steps:
1. `i` at the end of the previous iteration: `i = mdx + 1`
2. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`, which means `i = (mdx + 1) + 1 = mdx + 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, `res`) are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer input by the user and is not equal to 1, `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is set to 1.**
