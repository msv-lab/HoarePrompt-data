The code snippet provided sorts the list `a`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `mdx`, or `res`, but it does change the order of elements in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user, if `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer, if `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
