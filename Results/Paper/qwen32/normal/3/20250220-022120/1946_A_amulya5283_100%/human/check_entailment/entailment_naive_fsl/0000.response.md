Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Let's analyze why:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted, which is correct for finding the median.
2. **Finding the Median Index**: The median index `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, which is correct for both odd and even lengths of the array.
3. **Counting Operations**: The program counts how many elements starting from the median index `mdx` are equal to the median value `a[mdx]`. However, this does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 2 2 3 4
```
- The sorted array is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`.
- The median index `mdx` is `2` (since `n = 5` and `mdx = 5 // 2 + 5 % 2 - 1 = 2`).
- The median value is `2`.
- The program counts how many elements from index `2` to the end are equal to `2`, which is `2` (elements at indices `2` and `3` are `2`).
- However, to increase the median, we need to make the new median greater than `2`. We can do this by increasing the middle element `2` to `3` (one operation), or by increasing one of the `2`s to `3` and another element to at least `3` (two operations).

The correct answer is `1` (increase the middle `2` to `3`), but the program outputs `2`.

### Correct Approach:
To find the minimum number of operations to increase the median, we need to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the median.
3. Increase the median value to the smallest number greater than the current median. This can be done by counting how many elements need to be increased to surpass the current median value.

The provided program does not handle this correctly and thus is incorrect.
