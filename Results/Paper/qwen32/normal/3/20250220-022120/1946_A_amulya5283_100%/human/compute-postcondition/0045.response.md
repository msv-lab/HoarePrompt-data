The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1 before it is decremented.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `t` so that it is at least 1 before the next iteration starts.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, and `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer. If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
