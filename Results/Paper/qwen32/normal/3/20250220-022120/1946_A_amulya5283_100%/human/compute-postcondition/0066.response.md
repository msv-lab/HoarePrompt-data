Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. If `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer. If `n` is not 1, `res` is the count of occurrences of `a[mdx]` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` in the list `a`. If `n` is 1, `i` is not defined. Otherwise, `i` is set to `n`.**
