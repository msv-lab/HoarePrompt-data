The code calculates the value of `mdx` based on the value of `n`. Specifically, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula adjusts `mdx` to point to the middle index of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or to the index just before the middle if `n` is even.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is the integer input by the user and is not equal to 1
- `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9
- `res` is 0

After executing the code:
- `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user and is not equal to 1; `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `res` is 0; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.**
