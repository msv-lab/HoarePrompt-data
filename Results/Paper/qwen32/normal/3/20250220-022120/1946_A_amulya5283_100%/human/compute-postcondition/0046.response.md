The value of `t` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `t` must be at least 1 initially, after the decrement, `t` will be at least 0.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, and `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer. If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
