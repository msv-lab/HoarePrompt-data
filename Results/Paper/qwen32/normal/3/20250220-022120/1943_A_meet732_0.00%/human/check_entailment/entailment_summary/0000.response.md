### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the given program to see if it correctly determines the final score of the game, which is the MEX of array `c` after both players have played optimally.

1. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or simply deleting them (Bob).
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both play optimally.

2. **MEX Definition**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using `cntl`.
   - It checks if `0` is not present in `a`. If `0` is not present, the MEX is `0`.
   - If `0` is present, the program calculates `c` as the minimum of `2` or the count of `0` in `a`.
   - It then iterates through integers from `1` to `n` and checks if the count of any integer `j` is less than `2`. If so, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if `j` is `n`. If either condition is true, it prints `j` as the MEX.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob will try to control the composition of `c` to either maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer `j` such that there are fewer than two occurrences of integers from `0` to `j` in `a`.

5. **Execution Summary**:
   - The function processes each test case, counts occurrences, and determines the MEX based on the logic described.
   - The summary indicates that the function correctly identifies the smallest integer `j` with fewer than two occurrences, which aligns with the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally. It efficiently counts occurrences and determines the smallest integer `j` with fewer than two occurrences, which corresponds to the MEX.

**Correctness: True**
