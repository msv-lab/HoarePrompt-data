To determine what will be printed by the `print(j)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the operations described.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be at least 1.
2. `cntl` is a list where `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
3. `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, meaning the integer `0` appears at least once in the list `a`.
4. `j` is incremented by 1.
5. `c` is decreased by 1.

### Key Points:
- The value of `j` is incremented by 1 before the `print` statement is executed.
- The value of `c` is decreased by 1, but this operation does not affect the `print` statement for `j`.

### Analysis:
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 before the `print` statement, the value of `j` at the time of printing will be the initial value of `j` plus 1.

### Final Output:
Given that the exact initial value of `j` is not specified, we can only describe the value of `j` in terms of its increment operation. If we denote the initial value of `j` as `j_initial`, then the value printed will be `j_initial + 1`.

However, since the task requires the most precise description possible and the increment operation is explicitly stated, we can describe the output as `j` being incremented by 1 from its initial value.

Output: **j (where j is the initial value of j incremented by 1)**

If we assume `j` was initialized to 0 (a common default), then the output would be 1. But since the initial value of `j` is not specified, we provide the general answer:

Output: **j (where j is the initial value of j incremented by 1)**
