Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.**
