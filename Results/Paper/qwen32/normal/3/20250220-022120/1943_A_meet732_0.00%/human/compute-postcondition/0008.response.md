The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `a` that was processed, and `a` must have at least two elements.

To execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element that hasn't been processed yet. Since `i` is the last element that was processed, the next iteration will process the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where the element at index `i` is 2 and all other elements are 0**.
