The code snippet creates a list `cntl` with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to `0`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input value for the number of iterations must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
