The code snippet `c -= 1` decrements the value of `c` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `cntl`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `cntl` will be such that `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `c` is decreased by 1.**
