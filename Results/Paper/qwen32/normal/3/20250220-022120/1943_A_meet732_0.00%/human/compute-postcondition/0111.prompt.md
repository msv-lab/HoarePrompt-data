Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                c -= 1
                if not c or j == n:
                    print(j)
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program continues without modifying `cntl`. Otherwise, the value of `j` when the loop terminates is either the first `j` where `c` becomes 0 or `n` if `c` never reaches 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final state of `cntl` is such that `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, the loop will print the value of `j` when `c` reaches 0 or when `j` equals `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program does not modify `cntl`. Otherwise, the value of `j` when the loop terminates (either because `c` becomes 0 or `j` reaches `n`) is determined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
