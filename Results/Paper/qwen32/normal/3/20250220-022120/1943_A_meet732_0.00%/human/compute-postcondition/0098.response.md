The value of `c` is decremented by 1. Given that `c` is either 0 or 1, if `c` was 1, it will now be 0. If `c` was 0, it will now be -1. However, based on the initial condition, `c` should remain either 0 or 1 after the decrement, so we'll consider the valid states for `c` after the operation.

Output State: **`cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not equal to 0; `c` is either -1 or 0; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is set to 0 or `j` equals `n`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
