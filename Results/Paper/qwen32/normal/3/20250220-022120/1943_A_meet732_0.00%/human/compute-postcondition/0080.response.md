The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the list `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the list `a` to iterate over.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `cntl[i]` which is 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken the value of the last element of `a` that was processed.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should take the value of the next element in the list `a`. Since we do not know the specific elements of `a`, we can only say that `i` should be updated to the next element in the sequence.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `cntl[i]` which is 1, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**
