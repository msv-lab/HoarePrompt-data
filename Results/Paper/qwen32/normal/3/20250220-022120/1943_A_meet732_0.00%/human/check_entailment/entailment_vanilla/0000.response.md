Let's go through the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Dynamics:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending to `c` (Alice) or just deleting from `a` (Bob).
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

3. **Optimal Play:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, which means she should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, which means he should try to block Alice from including small integers in `c`.

### Key Observations:

- **Zero's Role:**
  - If `0` is not in `a`, the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer.
  - If `0` is present, Alice can always include at least one `0` in `c` (since she plays first).

- **Count of Elements:**
  - If an integer `i` appears less than twice in `a`, it can only be included once in `c` (because Bob will delete the second occurrence if it exists).
  - If an integer `i` appears more than once, Alice and Bob will take turns picking them, and Bob will ensure that not all of them are included in `c`.

### Solution Analysis:

1. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using the `cntl` array.

2. **Handling Zero:**
   - If `0` is not in `a`, the MEX is `0`.
   - If `0` is in `a`, the variable `c` is initialized to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This means:
     - If there's only one `0`, `c` is `1`.
     - If there are two or more `0`s, `c` is `2`.

3. **Determining MEX:**
   - The program iterates from `1` to `n` and checks if the count of each integer `j` is less than `2`.
   - If the count is less than `2`, it decrements `c` (indicating that `j` can be included in `c`).
   - If `c` becomes `0` or `j` reaches `n`, it prints `j` as the MEX.

### Correctness of the Program:

- The logic for handling `0` is correct.
- The logic for determining the MEX based on the counts of integers is also correct.
- The program efficiently handles the constraints by using a count array and iterating through the possible integers.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players and correctly calculates the MEX for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
