Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `cntl` will be such that `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `c` is decreased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all other conditions and variables remain as specified in the initial state.
