Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`.
- The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not equal to 0.
- `c` is either -1 or 0.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is 3.
- The condition `if cntl[j] < 2` leads to `c` being set to -1 or `j` equals `n`, which breaks out of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `cntl`, `c`, `n`, and `j` remains unchanged.

The key point here is that the value of `j` is explicitly given as 3, and there is no operation that changes the value of `j` in the provided context. Therefore, when the `print(j)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `j`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
