The only variable in the loop head is `y`. According to the code, the loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration and continues as long as `y` is greater than or equal to 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was decremented by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented again by 1 from its current value.

Given that `y` is `y - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be one more than its current value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= `x` <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for the last `x` processed, `x` remains `next_x` (the next element in `test_cases`), `y` is `y + 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no updates are made to `max_sum` or `best_y`.**
