The code snippet provided sets `max_sum` to 0. This does not affect the other variables directly, so their values remain as described in the initial state. The only change is that `max_sum` is now explicitly set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for the last `x` processed, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is the `y` value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, `x` is `next_x` (the next element in `test_cases`), `y` is the value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, or the value where the loop broke, and `results` now includes the `best_y` value for the last `x` processed.**
