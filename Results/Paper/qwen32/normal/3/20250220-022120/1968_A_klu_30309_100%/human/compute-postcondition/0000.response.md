The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This operation does not affect the values of `t` or `test_cases`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000; `results` is an empty list.**
