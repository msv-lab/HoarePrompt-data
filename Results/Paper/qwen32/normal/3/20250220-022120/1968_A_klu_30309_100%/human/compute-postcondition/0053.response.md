To determine the final output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it updates the variables based on the given conditions.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`.
- `max_sum` is initially 0.
- `best_y` is initially 1.
- `x` is the next element in `test_cases`.

The loop iterates over each `x` in `test_cases` and for each `x`, it iterates `y` from `x - 1` down to `1`. For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y`, computes `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`, and updates `max_sum` and `best_y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. The loop breaks as soon as a new `max_sum` is found.

The loop will execute for each `x` in `test_cases`, and after processing all `x` values, the final `max_sum` and `best_y` will be the maximum `current_sum` found and the corresponding `y` value.

Let's summarize the output state after all iterations:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- `results` will contain the `best_y` value found for the last `x` processed, but typically, `results` would be updated for each `x` processed.
- `max_sum` will be the maximum `current_sum` found across all `x` and `y` values.
- `best_y` will be the `y` value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed.
- `x` will be the last element in `test_cases` that was processed.
- `y` will be the value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, or the value where the loop broke.

Given the nature of the loop, the final `max_sum` and `best_y` will be the optimal values found after processing all `x` in `test_cases`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for the last `x` processed, `max_sum` is the maximum `current_sum` found across all `x` and `y` values, `best_y` is the `y` value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, `x` is the last element in `test_cases` that was processed, `y` is the value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, or the value where the loop broke.**

In simpler terms, the final state will have the maximum sum found (`max_sum`) and the corresponding `y` value (`best_y`) for the last `x` processed, with `t` and `test_cases` remaining unchanged.
