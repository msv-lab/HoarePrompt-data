Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for the last `x` processed. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`. `x` remains `next_x` (the next element in `test_cases`), `y` is the value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, or the value where the loop broke, and `results` includes the `best_y` value for the last `x` processed. `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, no updates are made to `max_sum` or `best_y`.**
