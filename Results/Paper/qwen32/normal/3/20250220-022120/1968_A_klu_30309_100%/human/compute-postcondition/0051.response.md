Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is `y + 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remain as they were before the `break` statement. The only change is that the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
