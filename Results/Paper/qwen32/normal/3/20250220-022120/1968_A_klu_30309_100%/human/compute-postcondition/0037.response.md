Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is a predefined integer, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, none of the variable values change, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
