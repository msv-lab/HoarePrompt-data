The code snippet assigns the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the dictionary `mapping`. Given the initial state, `chr(c)` is 'a' because `c` is 97. Therefore, `mapping` will now contain the entry `{'a': char}`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` is `{'a': char}`; `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`; `char` is `char_next`; `c` is 97; and `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`**.
