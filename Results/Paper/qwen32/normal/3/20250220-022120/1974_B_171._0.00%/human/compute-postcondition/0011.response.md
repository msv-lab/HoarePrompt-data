The only object in the loop head is the variable `c`. According to the loop statement, `c` iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which corresponds to the ASCII values of the lowercase Latin letters 'a' to 'z'. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` held the ASCII value of a specific lowercase Latin letter. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to the next ASCII value within the specified range.

Let's denote the value of `c` at the end of the previous iteration as `ord('x')`, where 'x' is some lowercase Latin letter. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be `ord('x') + 1`.

Since the loop iterates through all lowercase Latin letters, the value of `c` at the start of the next iteration should simply be the next integer in the sequence, provided it is still within the range.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{chr(c): char}`, and `decoded` remains an empty list. If `chr(c)` is in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping` and `decoded` remain unchanged. `c` is the ASCII value of the next lowercase Latin letter after the previous iteration.**

To be more specific, if `c` was `ord('x')` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be `ord('x') + 1`. However, since we don't know the exact value of `c` from the previous iteration, we can just say that `c` is incremented by 1.
