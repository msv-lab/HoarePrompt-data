Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains one entry `{'a': char}`, `decoded` is a list containing the value `char` appended to it if `char` exists in `mapping`; otherwise, `decoded` contains `chr(c)` appended to it, `char` is `char_next_next`
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` is updated to include `{chr(c): char}` and `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)` appended to it. If `chr(c)` was already in `mapping.values()`, no changes are made to `mapping` or `decoded`. `char` is `char_next_next`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps characters from `encoded` to `decoded`. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` is updated with an additional entry `chr(c): char_next_next`, `decoded` remains a list of characters, `char` is set to `char_next_next`, and `c` is incremented by 1. If `chr(c)` is already in `mapping.values()`, no changes are made to `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, or `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. `mapping` is a dictionary that maps characters from `encoded` to `decoded`, and if `chr(c)` (which is 'y') is not in the values of `mapping`, a new entry {'y': `char_next_next`} is added to `mapping`. `decoded` remains a list of characters. `char` is set to `char_next_next`. `c` is 121. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
