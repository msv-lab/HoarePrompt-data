Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` is updated to include `{chr(c): char}` and `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)` appended to it. If `chr(c)` was already in `mapping.values()`, no changes are made to `mapping` or `decoded`. `char` is `char_next_next`.**
