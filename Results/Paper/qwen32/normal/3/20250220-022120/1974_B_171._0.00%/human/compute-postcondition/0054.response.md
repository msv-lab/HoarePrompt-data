Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. `mapping` is a dictionary that maps characters from `encoded` to `decoded`, and if `chr(c)` (which is 'y') is not in the values of `mapping`, a new entry {'y': `char_next_next`} is added to `mapping`. `decoded` remains a list of characters. `char` is set to `char_next_next`. `c` is 121. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
