Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps characters from `encoded` to `decoded` and includes the new entry {'y': `char_next_next`}, `decoded` remains a list of characters, `char` is set to `char_next_next`, `c` is 121 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, and `c` remain unchanged. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
