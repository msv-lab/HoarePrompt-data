Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` is an empty dictionary; `decoded` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for char in encoded:
    if char in mapping:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    else:
        for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
            if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                mapping[chr(c)] = char
                break
        decoded.append(chr(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains one entry `{'a': char}`. `decoded` is a list containing either the value `mapping[char]` if `char` exists in `mapping`, or `chr(c)` if `char` does not exist in `mapping`. `char` remains the same as it was in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains one entry `{'a': char}`. `decoded` is a list containing the value `char` appended to it if `char` exists in `mapping`; otherwise, `decoded` contains `chr(c)` appended to it. `char` is `char_next`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains one entry `{'a': char}`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` is a list containing the value `char` appended to it. Otherwise, `mapping` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' as values, with the last character added being 'z' with the value `char_next_next`, and `decoded` is a list of characters with an additional character `chr(c)` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
