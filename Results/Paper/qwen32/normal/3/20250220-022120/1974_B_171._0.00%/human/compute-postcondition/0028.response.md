Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` remains either an empty dictionary or `{'a': char}`; `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`; `char` is `char_next`; and `c` is 97. If `chr(c)` is in `mapping.values()`, the behavior is undefined as per the given else part (which is None).**
