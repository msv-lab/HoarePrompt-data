The code `decoded.append(chr(c))` appends a new character to the `decoded` list. This character is determined by converting the integer `c` to its corresponding character using the `chr` function.

Output State: **`mapping` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' as values, with the last character added being 'z' with the value `char_next_next`, and `decoded` is now a list of characters with an additional character `chr(c)` appended to it.**

In natural language: The `decoded` list now includes an additional character, which is the character representation of the integer `c`. The `mapping` dictionary remains unchanged.
