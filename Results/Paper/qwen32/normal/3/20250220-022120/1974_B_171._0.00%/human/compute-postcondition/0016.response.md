The code snippet `mapping[chr(c)] = char` updates the `mapping` dictionary by adding or updating an entry where the key is the character corresponding to the ASCII value `c` (which is 98) and the value is `char`. The value of `char` is not provided, so we will keep it as `char`.

Since `c` is 98, `chr(c)` will be the character 'b'. Therefore, the dictionary `mapping` will have an entry `mapping['b'] = char`.

The values of `encoded`, `decoded`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary with an entry `mapping['b'] = char`, `decoded` is a list that may have been updated, `c` is 98**.
