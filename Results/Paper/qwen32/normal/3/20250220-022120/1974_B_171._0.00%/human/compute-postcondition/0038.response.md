The provided code snippet appends a character to the `decoded` list. Specifically, it appends the character representation of the integer `c` using the `chr(c)` function.

Given the initial state:
- `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `mapping` is `{'a': char}`.
- `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)`.
- `char` is `char_next`.

The line `decoded.append(chr(c))` modifies the `decoded` list by adding another character to it. The value of `c` is not specified, but it will be converted to a character and appended to the `decoded` list.

Thus, the updated `decoded` list will now contain the original elements plus the new element `chr(c)`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` is `{'a': char}`; `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)` and `chr(c)` (or more precisely, the original elements of `decoded` plus `chr(c)`); `char` is `char_next`.**
