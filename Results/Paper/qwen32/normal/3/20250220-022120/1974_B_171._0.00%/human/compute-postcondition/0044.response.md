The code snippet `mapping[chr(c)] = char` adds a new entry to the `mapping` dictionary, where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. Given the initial state, `mapping` could either be empty or contain one entry `{'a': char}`. After the execution of this code, `mapping` will definitely contain the new entry.

Here's the updated state:

- `encoded` remains a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `mapping` will now contain the entry `{chr(c): char}` in addition to any existing entry. If `mapping` was previously empty, it will now have one entry. If it already contained `{'a': char}`, it will now contain `{'a': char, chr(c): char}`.
- `decoded` remains a list containing `chr(c)` appended to it.
- `char` remains `char_next_next`.
- `chr(c)` remains not in `mapping.values()` before the update, but after the update, it will be in `mapping.values()` as the value for the key `chr(c)`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` contains the entry `{chr(c): char}` and possibly the entry `{'a': char}` if it was previously present; `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)` appended to it; `char` is `char_next_next`; `chr(c)` is now in `mapping.values()`.**
