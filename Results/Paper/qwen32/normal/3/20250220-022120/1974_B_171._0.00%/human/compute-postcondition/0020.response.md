The code snippet `decoded.append(chr(c))` appends the character representation of the integer `c` to the `decoded` list. 

Given the initial state, we know that `decoded` was initially an empty list. After executing the code, `decoded` will contain one element, which is `chr(c)`.

The values of `encoded`, `mapping`, and `char` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`encoded` remains unchanged as a string of lowercase Latin letters; `mapping` will have one entry `{'a': char}`; `decoded` is a list containing one element `chr(c)`; `char` remains the same as it was in the initial state.**
