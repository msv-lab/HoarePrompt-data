The code snippet `mapping[chr(c)] = char` updates the `mapping` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair where the key is the character representation of the integer `c` (which is 121) and the value is the current value of `char` (which is `char_next_next`).

The character representation of `c` (121) is 'y'. Therefore, the `mapping` dictionary will now have a new entry where the key is 'y' and the value is `char_next_next`.

The other variables (`encoded`, `decoded`, `char`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps characters from `encoded` to `decoded` and includes the new entry {'y': `char_next_next`}, `decoded` remains a list of characters, `char` is set to `char_next_next`, `c` is 121**.
