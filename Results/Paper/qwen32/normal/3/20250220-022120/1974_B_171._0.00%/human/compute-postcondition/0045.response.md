Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` contains the entry `{chr(c): char}` and possibly the entry `{'a': char}` if it was previously present; `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)` appended to it; `char` is `char_next_next`; `chr(c)` is now in `mapping.values()`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
