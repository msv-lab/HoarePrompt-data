### Reasoning:

The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win in a sequence of games where Eve optimally removes one number at a time from the sequence. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero (e.g., `a ^ a = 0`).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself (e.g., `a ^ 0 = a`).
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Effect of Numbers**:
   - `1` contributes to flipping the least significant bit in the XOR result.
   - `2` contributes to flipping the second least significant bit.
   - `3` contributes to flipping both the least significant and the second least significant bits.
   - `4` contributes to flipping the third least significant bit.

3. **Winning Condition for Bob**:
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is `0`.

4. **Strategy for Eve**:
   - Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers becomes `0` as many times as possible.

#### Analysis of the Program:
The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by evaluating the counts of `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` in the sequence. It computes a sum based on these counts and then divides this sum by `3`.

Let's break down the formula used in the program:
- `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`: This part of the formula seems to be counting pairs of numbers that can be removed to potentially zero out the XOR result. Specifically:
  - For `1`, `2`, and `3`, it counts pairs and possibly an extra element (if the count is odd).
  - For `4`, it only counts pairs since `4` affects a different bit position and does not contribute to zeroing out the XOR result with `1`, `2`, or `3`.

- The sum is then divided by `3` to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the formula with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3))`
   - Result: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`, divided by `3` gives `1`.
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (3 < 3))`
   - Result: `1 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 5`, divided by `3` gives `1`.
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3))`
   - Result: `3 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 9`, divided by `3` gives `3`.
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3))`
   - Result: `5 + 5 + 3 + 0 = 13`, divided by `3` gives `4` (but the correct output is `3`, indicating a possible error in the formula).

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (3 < 3))`
   - Result: `0 + 14 + 14 + 13 = 41`, divided by `3` gives `13` (but the correct output is `12`, indicating a possible error in the formula).

Given the discrepancies in the last two examples, the formula used in the program seems to be incorrect for some cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
