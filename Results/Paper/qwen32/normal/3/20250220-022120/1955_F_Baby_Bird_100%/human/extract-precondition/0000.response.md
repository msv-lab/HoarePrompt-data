Precondition: **Each test case consists of four integers p1, p2, p3, and p4 (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The function will receive multiple test cases, with the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided initially.**
