Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis

The game's winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence. Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve's goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins by removing numbers optimally.

### Key Points
- XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across the numbers is even.
- Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in binary are `01`, `10`, `11`, and `100` respectively.
- Eve needs to remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has an even count of `1`s in each bit position as often as possible.

### Strategy for Eve
To maximize Bob's wins, Eve needs to ensure that the bitwise XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as many times as possible. This can be achieved by:
- Removing numbers in pairs that cancel each other out in terms of their binary representation.
- Ensuring that the count of `1`s in each bit position among the remaining numbers is even.

### Analysis of the Provided Program
The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
2. It computes a sum for each test case using the formula:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 3 \times \left(\frac{p_i}{2}\right) + p_i \% 2 \times (i < 3)
   \]
   where \( p_i \) is the count of the \( i \)-th type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), and \( i \) is the index (0 for 1, 1 for 2, 2 for 3, 3 for 4).
3. It then divides this sum by 3 and prints the result.

### Detailed Explanation of the Formula
- For numbers 1, 2, and 3 (indices 0, 1, 2):
  - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{p_i}{2}\right) \) counts the number of pairs of these numbers, which can be removed to ensure even counts in the bitwise representation.
  - \( p_i \% 2 \times (i < 3) \) adds 1 if there is an odd count of these numbers, allowing for a potential zero XOR if paired with another number.
- For number 4 (index 3):
  - Since 4 is `100` in binary, pairs of 4 do not affect the lower two bits. Thus, only the integer division part is considered.

### Verification Using Examples
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation:
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{0}{2}\right) + 0 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
     - Total sum = \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3 \)
     - Result = \( \frac{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation:
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{0}{2}\right) + 0 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{2}{2}\right) + 2 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
     - Total sum = \( 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 5 \)
     - Result = \( \frac{5}{3} = 1 \) (integer division)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation:
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{2}{2}\right) + 2 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{2}{2}\right) + 2 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{2}{2}\right) + 2 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{0}{2}\right) + 0 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
     - Total sum = \( 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 9 \)
     - Result = \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \)
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation:
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{3}{2}\right) + 3 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) = 4 + 1 = 5 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{3}{2}\right) + 3 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) = 4 + 1 = 5 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{2}{2}\right) + 2 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{0}{2}\right) + 0 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
     - Total sum = \( 5 + 5 + 3 + 0 = 13 \)
     - Result = \( \frac{13}{3} = 4 \) (integer division)
   - Output: `4` (Incorrect, should be `3`)

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation:
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{0}{2}\right) + 0 \% 2 \times (0 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{9}{2}\right) + 9 \% 2 \times (1 < 3) = 13 + 1 = 14 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{9}{2}\right) + 9 \% 2 \times (2 < 3) = 13 + 1 = 14 \)
     - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{9}{2}\right) + 9 \% 2 \times (3 < 3) = 13 + 0 = 13 \)
     - Total sum = \( 0 + 14 + 14 + 13 = 41 \)
     - Result = \( \frac{41}{3} = 13 \) (integer division)
   - Output: `13` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails in Example 4, where the expected output is `3` but the program outputs `4`. This indicates that the logic for calculating the maximum number of times Bob can win is flawed.
