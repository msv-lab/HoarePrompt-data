Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26], `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value and is now either `lex - 1` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 26` if the initial `lex` was greater than 26, and `j` is 1.**

The value of `arr` has been updated to include an additional element, 26, at the end. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
