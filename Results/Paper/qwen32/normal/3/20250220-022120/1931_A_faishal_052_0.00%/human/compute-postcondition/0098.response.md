The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer `26` to the end of the list `arr`. Therefore, `arr` is no longer an empty list but contains the single element `26`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an integer greater than 26 and less than 52.**
