The loop provided only iterates twice (`for j in range(2)`), meaning it will execute exactly 2 times regardless of the initial value of `lex`. Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop (which is 2 iterations) is the same as the output state after the loop executes 2 times.

Let's summarize the output state after the loop has finished executing both iterations:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `cases` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` will be 1 after the loop completes.
- `arr` will be one of the following: `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`.
- `lex` will be adjusted based on its initial value. If the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `lex` will be `lex - 2`. If the initial `lex` was greater than 26 but less than 52, `lex` will be `lex - 27`. If the initial `lex` was 52 or greater, `lex` will be `lex - 52`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is either [1, 1], [26, 1], [1, 26], or [26, 26], and `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value and is now either `lex - 2` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 but less than 52, or `lex - 52` if the initial `lex` was 52 or greater.**
