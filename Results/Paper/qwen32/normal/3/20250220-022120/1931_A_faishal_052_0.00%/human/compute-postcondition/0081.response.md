Given the initial state, the list `arr` contains three elements where the first two elements are either 1 or 26, and the third element is `lex`. After sorting `arr`, the elements will be rearranged in ascending order.

Let's consider the possible initial values for the first two elements of `arr`:
- If the first two elements are both 1, then `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`. Sorting this, `arr` becomes `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex >= 1` or `[lex, 1, 1]` if `lex < 1`. However, since `lex` is part of the list and the problem specifies the first two elements are either 1 or 26, `lex` must be either 1 or 26. Therefore, `arr` will be `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` is 1 or 26, and it will be sorted to `[1, 1, lex]`.
- If the first two elements are both 26, then `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`. Sorting this, `arr` becomes `[lex, 26, 26]` if `lex < 26` or `[26, 26, lex]` if `lex >= 26`. Since `lex` is either 1 or 26, `arr` will be sorted to `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 1, or `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26.
- If one element is 1 and the other is 26, then `arr` could be `[1, 26, lex]` or `[26, 1, lex]`. Sorting this, `arr` becomes `[1, lex, 26]` if `lex < 26` or `[1, 26, lex]` if `lex >= 26`. Since `lex` is either 1 or 26, `arr` will be sorted to `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` is 1, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26.

Combining these cases, after sorting, `arr` will be one of the following:
- `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` is 1
- `[1, lex, 26]` if `lex` is 26, and the first two elements were not both 26
- `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26, and at least one of the first two elements was 26

However, since the first two elements are either 1 or 26, and `lex` is either 1 or 26, the sorted `arr` will be:
- `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 1
- `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` is 26 and the first two elements were 1 and 1
- `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26 and at least one of the first two elements was 26

Given the conditions, the most accurate and general sorted state is:
- `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` is 1
- `[1, lex, 26]` if `lex` is 26

Since `lex` is either 1 or 26, the sorted `arr` will be:
- `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 1
- `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 1, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26.**
