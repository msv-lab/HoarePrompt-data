Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is [26], `lex` is the integer value provided by the user input minus 26 and is greater than or equal to 26, `k` is 3.**

In simpler terms, after the code execution, `lex` has been reduced by 26, but it remains greater than or equal to 26. All other variables retain their initial values.
