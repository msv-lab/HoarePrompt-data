The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have taken the value 0 (since the loop is starting and `j` is initialized to 0 in the loop head).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 0 at the start of the loop. The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `lex`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is either [1] or [26], `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value, `j` is 0**
