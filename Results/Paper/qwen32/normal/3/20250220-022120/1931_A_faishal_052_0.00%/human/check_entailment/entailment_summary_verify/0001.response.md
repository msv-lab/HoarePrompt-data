### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the provided program in the context of the problem description and the function summary to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to decode an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) into the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word.
- Each letter is represented by its position in the alphabet (1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', ..., 26 for 'z').
- The goal is to find the smallest possible word (lexicographically) that sums to `n`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the encoded integer `lex` for each test case.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice (for the first two letters) and appends either `1` or `26` to `arr` based on the value of `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends `1` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends `26` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it also appends `26` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts the list `arr` to ensure the smallest possible lexicographical order.
   - It then prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr`.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of Values:**
   - The logic for appending `1` or `26` to `arr` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the values in a way that ensures the smallest lexicographical order.
   - For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might append `1` twice and then `22`, resulting in `arr = [1, 1, 22]`. Sorting this gives `arr = [1, 1, 22]`, which corresponds to the word "aab", not "aav".
   - The final value of `lex` is directly appended to `arr` without ensuring it is within the valid range (1 to 26).

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting `arr` might not always give the correct result because the initial values appended do not guarantee the smallest lexicographical order.

3. **Output:**
   - The program does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, one should:
- Start with the smallest possible letters ('a', 'a', 'a').
- Incrementally increase the letters to reach the target sum while maintaining the smallest lexicographical order.
- A correct approach would involve iterating over possible values for the first letter, then the second, and finally determining the third letter to ensure the sum equals `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
