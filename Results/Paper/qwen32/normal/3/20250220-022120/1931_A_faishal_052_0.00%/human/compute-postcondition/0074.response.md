Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 26, and `arr` is either `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, `[26, 26, 26]`.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
