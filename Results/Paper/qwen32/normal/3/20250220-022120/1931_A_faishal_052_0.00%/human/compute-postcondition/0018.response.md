The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the end of the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` is either `[1]` or `[26]`. After appending `1`, the new state of `arr` will be `[1, 1]` if it was initially `[1]`, or `[26, 1]` if it was initially `[26]`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is either [1, 1] or [26, 1], `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value, `j` is 0**.
