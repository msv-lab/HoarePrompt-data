Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26], `lex` has been further adjusted based on its initial value and is now either `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 52` if the initial `lex` was greater than 26, and `j` is 1.**
