Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is [], `lex` is the integer value provided by the user input, `k` is 3.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` is [1] and `lex` is now `lex` minus 1. If `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is now `lex` minus 26. If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is now `lex` minus 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` is either [1, 1] or [26, 1], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 1. If `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` is [26, 1] or [1, 26] or [26, 26], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 26 or 52. If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `arr` is [26, 1] or [1, 26] or [26, 26], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 26 or 52, and can be 0, 26, or a value between 26 and 51.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` is either [1, 1, 1] or [26, 1, 1], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 2. If `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` is [26, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], or [26, 26, 1], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 27 or 53. If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `arr` is [26, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], or [26, 26, 1], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 27 or 53, and can be -1, 25, or a value between 25 and 50. If `lex` was originally greater than 26, `arr` can also be [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 26 or 52, and can be 0, 26, or a value between 26 and 51.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
