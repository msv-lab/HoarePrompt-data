To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `cases` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `arr` is either `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, or `[26, 26, lex]`.
- `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value:
  - If the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `lex` is now `lex - 2`.
  - If the initial `lex` was greater than 26 but less than 52, `lex` is now `lex - 27`.
  - If the initial `lex` was 52 or greater, `lex` is now `lex - 52`.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

Here, `arr[k]` is an element of the list `arr`. Since `arr` can be one of `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, or `[26, 26, lex]`, `arr[k]` can be either `1`, `26`, or `lex`.

The `chr()` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character. Adding 96 to an integer `n` gives the ASCII value of the character that is `n` positions after 'a' in the alphabet.

### Possible Values of `arr[k]`:
- If `arr[k]` is `1`, `chr(arr[k] + 96)` becomes `chr(1 + 96)`, which is `chr(97)`, resulting in the character `'a'`.
- If `arr[k]` is `26`, `chr(arr[k] + 96)` becomes `chr(26 + 96)`, which is `chr(122)`, resulting in the character `'z'`.
- If `arr[k]` is `lex`, since `lex` has been adjusted, its value is between 1 and 26 (inclusive) after the adjustment. Therefore, `chr(lex + 96)` will be a character between `'a'` and `'z'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement will depend on the value of `arr[k]`. Since `arr[k]` can be `1`, `26`, or `lex` (which is adjusted to be between 1 and 26), the printed character will be either `'a'`, `'z'`, or any character between `'a'` and `'z'` based on the adjusted value of `lex`.

Given the information, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **a (if arr[k] is 1), z (if arr[k] is 26), or a character between 'a' and 'z' (if arr[k] is lex, where lex is adjusted to be between 1 and 26)**
