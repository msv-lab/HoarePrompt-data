The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the end of the list `arr`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `cases` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `k` is 3.
- `arr` is either [1] or [26] depending on the initial value of `lex`.
- `lex` is adjusted based on its original value.

After executing `arr.append(1)`, the list `arr` will have an additional element `1` appended to it. Therefore, if `arr` was originally [1], it will now be [1, 1]. If `arr` was originally [26], it will now be [26, 1].

The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `lex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `arr` is either [1, 1] or [26, 1], `lex` is adjusted based on its original value.**
