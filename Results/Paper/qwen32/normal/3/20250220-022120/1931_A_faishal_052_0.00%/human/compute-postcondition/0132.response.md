The given loop iterates over the range of 3, meaning it will execute exactly 3 times. The loop prints a character corresponding to the ASCII value of each element in the `arr` list plus 96. The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, and `j` do not change within the loop, and `k` is used as the loop variable.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:

- **Iteration 1 (k = 0)**: Prints the character corresponding to `arr[0] + 96`.
- **Iteration 2 (k = 1)**: Prints the character corresponding to `arr[1] + 96`.
- **Iteration 3 (k = 2)**: Prints the character corresponding to `arr[2] + 96`.

After all iterations, the value of `k` will be 3, as the loop variable `k` will have completed its range.

Given the possible values of `arr`, the output will be a string of three characters derived from the values in `arr` by converting each value to its corresponding lowercase letter (since `chr(value + 96)` converts a number between 1 and 26 to the corresponding lowercase letter).

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, cases is greater than 1, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, arr is either [1, 1, lex], [1, lex, 26], or [lex, 26, 26] where lex is adjusted to be between 1 and 26**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, the variables `t`, `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The loop variable `k` will be 3, and the array `arr` will still be one of the specified forms. The loop will have printed three characters corresponding to the values in `arr` converted to lowercase letters.
