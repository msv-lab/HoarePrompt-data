Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally between 0 and 25, `arr` is [1, 1] and `lex` is unchanged. If `lex` was originally greater than 25, `arr` is [26, 1] and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` was originally between -25 and -1, `arr` is [1, 26]. If `lex` was originally greater than -1 and less than 52, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`.**

This postcondition covers all the specified cases for the values of `lex` and the corresponding changes to `arr` and `lex` after the if-else block executes.
