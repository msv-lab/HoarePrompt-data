The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Given that `arr` can be one of the following: `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, or `[26, 26, lex]`, the sorted versions of these lists will be:

- `[1, 1, lex]` remains `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex >= 1`
- `[1, 26, lex]` becomes `[1, lex, 26]` if `1 < lex < 26`
- `[26, 1, lex]` becomes `[1, lex, 26]` if `1 < lex < 26`
- `[26, 26, lex]` becomes `[lex, 26, 26]` if `lex <= 26`

Since `lex` is adjusted based on the value of `lex` after the iterations, we need to consider these conditions:

- If `lex` is less than 1, the sorted array would be `[lex, 1, 1]` or `[lex, 1, 26]` or `[lex, 26, 26]`, but since `lex` is adjusted to be within the valid range (1 to 26), this scenario is not applicable.
- If `lex` is between 1 and 26, the sorted array would be `[1, lex, 26]` or `[1, 1, lex]` or `[lex, 26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 26, it would be adjusted to a value within the valid range (1 to 26), so it would fit into one of the above scenarios.

Thus, the sorted array `arr` will be one of `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, lex, 26]`, or `[lex, 26, 26]` where `lex` is adjusted to be between 1 and 26.

The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [1, lex, 26], or [lex, 26, 26] where `lex` is adjusted to be between 1 and 26.**
