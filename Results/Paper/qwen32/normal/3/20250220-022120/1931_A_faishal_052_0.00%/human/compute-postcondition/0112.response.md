Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26]. If `lex` is an integer such that -25 <= lex <= 25, `arr` is [1, 26]. If `lex` is an integer greater than 25, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` is an integer such that -26 <= lex <= -1, `arr` is [1, 26]. If `lex` is an integer greater than -1, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`.**
