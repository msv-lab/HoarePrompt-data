Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26], `lex` has been further adjusted based on its previous value and is now either `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 52` if the initial `lex` was greater than 26, and `j` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that the value of `lex` has been reduced by an additional 26. If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, it is now `lex - 27`. If `lex` was initially greater than 26, it is now `lex - 52`. All other variables remain unchanged.
