`lex` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `arr`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.**
