Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is [26], `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, `lex` is now the value provided by the user input minus 26 and is greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `lex` remains the value provided by the user input minus 26 and is greater than or equal to 26.**
