Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` is either [1, 1] or [26, 1], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 1. If `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` is [26, 1] or [1, 26] or [26, 26], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 26 or 52. If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `arr` is [26, 1] or [1, 26] or [26, 26], and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 26 or 52, and can be 0, 26, or a value between 26 and 51.**
