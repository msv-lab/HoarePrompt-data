Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` such that `p[p[i] - 1] == p[i] - 1`. If such an index exists, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function performs this check for each test case and outputs the result accordingly.**
