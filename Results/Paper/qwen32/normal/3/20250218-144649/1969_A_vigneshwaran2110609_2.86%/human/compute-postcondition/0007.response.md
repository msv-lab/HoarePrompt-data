The `print(2)` statement simply outputs the integer `2`. This is a straightforward print statement that does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, `x`, `l`, `i`, and `flag` do not influence the output of this specific print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2**
