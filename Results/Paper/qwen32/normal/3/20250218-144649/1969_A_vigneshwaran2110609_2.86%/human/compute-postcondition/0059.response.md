The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It only exits the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the values of `i`, `x`, `n`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `n` is the old `x`, `l` is a new list of integers from the input, `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
