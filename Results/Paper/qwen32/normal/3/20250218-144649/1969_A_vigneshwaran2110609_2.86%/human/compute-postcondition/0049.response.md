Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `n` is the old `x`, `l` is a new list of integers from the input, `flag` is `True`, and the element at index `l[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to `l[i] - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the current loop or if statement. Thus, all the variables retain their initial values, and the loop or if statement is exited.
