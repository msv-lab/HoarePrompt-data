The code snippet provided is `eta.append(j)`. This line of code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. The initial state does not mention `eta` as a predefined list, so we must assume that `eta` is either an existing list or it will be created at this point. However, since the task specifies to include all information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed and to update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code, we will consider `eta` as an existing list and update it accordingly.

Given the initial state, `j` is `n + 1`. Therefore, the value `n + 1` will be appended to the list `eta`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer such that n >= 3 (and 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta` is a list with the value `n + 1` appended to it.**
