The code snippet `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. Given the initial state, `k` is initially defined as `k + a + (b + c) // 3`. After the increment, `k` will be `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, `n`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
