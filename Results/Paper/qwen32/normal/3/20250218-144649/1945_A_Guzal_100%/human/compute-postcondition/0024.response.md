The code snippet provided initializes a variable `k` to 0. This action does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, `n`, or `i`. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` continues to be incremented by 1 as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `k` is 0.**
