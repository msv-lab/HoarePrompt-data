The `print(-1)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, `n`, `i`, or `k`. The statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, `n`, `i`, `k`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is explicitly printing the value `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:

Output: **-1**
