The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers, and `t` and `n` have other constraints. The code will overwrite the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` with the new input values.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` must be greater than 0.**
