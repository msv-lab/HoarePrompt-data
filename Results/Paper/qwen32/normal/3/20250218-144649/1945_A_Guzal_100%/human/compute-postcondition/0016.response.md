The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the value `-1`. The initial state describes several variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i`), but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It simply outputs the integer `-1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state mentions that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
2. `t` is an integer with a range from 1 to 10^4.
3. `n` is greater than 0.
4. `k` is initialized to 0.
5. `i` is incremented by 1 (though the exact value of `i` is not relevant to the `print` statement).

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the value `-1` directly.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
