The code snippet `sum += i * n` increments the variable `sum` by the product of `i` and `n`. The other variables (`r`, `n`, `t`, and the precondition `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the operation, the new value of `sum` will be `i * n`.

Output State: **`sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` must be greater than 0, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**
