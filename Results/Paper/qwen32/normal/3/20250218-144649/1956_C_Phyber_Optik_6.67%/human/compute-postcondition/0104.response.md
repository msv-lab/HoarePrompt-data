The code snippet increments the value of `sum` by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Given the initial state, `sum` has two possible values depending on the initial comparison between `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `i * n`. After the code execution, `sum` will be updated accordingly.

If `sum` was initially `2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`, it becomes `2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2) + n * (n + 1) // 2` which simplifies to `3 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.
If `sum` was initially `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`, it becomes `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` which simplifies to `i * n + 2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.

The other variables `j`, `n`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is either `3 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `i * n + 2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was less than or equal to `i * n` initially, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
