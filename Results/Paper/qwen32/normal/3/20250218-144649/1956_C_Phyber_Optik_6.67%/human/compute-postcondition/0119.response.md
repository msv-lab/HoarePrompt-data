Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step based on the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `j` is 2
- `n` is 1
- `r` is 0

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify the `range` function arguments**:
   - The `range` function is called with two arguments: `1` and `n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is 1, `n + 1` evaluates to `2`.

2. **Evaluate the `range` function**:
   - `range(1, 2)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, 2.
   - This results in the sequence: `[1]`.

3. **Unpack the sequence with `*` operator**:
   - The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the sequence `[1]` so that each element is passed as a separate argument to `print`.
   - Therefore, `print(*range(1, n + 1))` is equivalent to `print(1)`.

4. **Determine the output**:
   - The `print` function will output the number `1`.

Thus, the final output is:

Output: **1**
