The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of these variables. Specifically, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n + r + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the last value that satisfied `j < n + r + 1`. Since `r` is 1, the loop condition is `j < n + 2`. After the loop body executes, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `r` is fixed at 1 and `n` must be at least 0, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the incremented value of `j`.

State: **`sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r = 1`, `n` must be at least 0, `j` is incremented by 1** 

To be more specific, if `j` was `n + 1` at the end of the last iteration (which is the last value satisfying `j < n + 2`), then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `n + 2`. However, since the question asks for the state at the start of the next iteration before `j` is incremented within the loop, `j` should be `n + 1`.

State: **`sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r = 1`, `n` must be at least 0, `j = n + 1`**
