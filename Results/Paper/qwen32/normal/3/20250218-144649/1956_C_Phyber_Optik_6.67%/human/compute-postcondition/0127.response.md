Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

Initial State:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `r` is 1

The print statement is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Here, the `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n + 1`. Given that `n` is 1, the expression `n + 1` evaluates to 2. Thus, `range(1, 2)` generates a sequence containing only the number 1.

The `*` operator in the `print` function call unpacks the sequence generated by `range(1, 2)` and prints each element separately. Since the sequence contains only one element, which is 1, the `print` statement will output just that number.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **1**
