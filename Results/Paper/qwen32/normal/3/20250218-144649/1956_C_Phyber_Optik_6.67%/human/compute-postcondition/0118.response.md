Based on the initial state provided, the variables have the following values:
- `j` is 2
- `n` is 1
- `r` is 0

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

Here's the breakdown of what will be printed:
- The first argument to `print` is the integer `1`.
- The second argument to `print` is the variable `j`, which has the value `2`.
- The `end=' '` argument changes the default newline character at the end of the `print` statement to a space.

Therefore, the output will be the values `1` and `2` printed on the same line, separated by a space, and ending with another space instead of a newline.

Output: **1 2 **
