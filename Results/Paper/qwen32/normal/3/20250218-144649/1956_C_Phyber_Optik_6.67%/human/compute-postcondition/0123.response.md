To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head, which includes `j`, `n`, and `r`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the value of `n + r + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 2
- `n` is 1
- `r` is 0

The loop condition is `j in range(1, n + r + 1)`. Let's evaluate the condition with the current values:
- `n + r + 1` equals `1 + 0 + 1` which is `2`.
- The range is `range(1, 2)`, which means `j` can only be `1`.

Since `j` is `2` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would not execute again with the current values of `n` and `r`. To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` and/or `r` such that `j` is within the range.

For the loop to execute again:
- `j` should be `1` at the start of the iteration (since `j` is incremented within the loop, it will become `2` during the first iteration, and we need it to be within the range for the loop to execute).
- `n + r + 1` should be greater than `2` to include `j = 2` in the next iteration.

Let's adjust `n` and `r` accordingly:
- If `n` is `1` and `r` is `1`, then `n + r + 1` equals `3`, and the range is `range(1, 3)`, which includes `1` and `2`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time:
- `j` should be `1`.
- `n` should be `1`.
- `r` should be `1`.

State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 1, `r` is 1**
