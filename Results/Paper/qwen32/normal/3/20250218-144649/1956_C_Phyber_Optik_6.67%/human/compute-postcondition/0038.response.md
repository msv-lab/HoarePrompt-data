Let's break down the given information and the print statement step by step:

1. The initial state specifies that `sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is at least 0. However, the variable `sum` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore this detail for the output.

2. The variable `r` is set to 1, but it is also not used in the print statement.

3. The variable `n` is at least 0, but its exact value is not specified, and it is not used in the print statement.

4. The variable `j` is set to 1 and is used in the print statement.

5. The print statement is `print(1, j, end=' ')`. This means it will print the value 1, followed by the value of `j`, and the end parameter is set to a space, meaning no newline will be added after the print statement.

Since `j` is explicitly set to 1, we can substitute this value directly into the print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **1 1**
