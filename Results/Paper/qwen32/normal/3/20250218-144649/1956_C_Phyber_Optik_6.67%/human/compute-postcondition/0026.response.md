To determine what will be printed by the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

- `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`: This line calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. However, this variable `sum` is not directly used in the `print` statement.
- `r = 1`: This variable is defined but not used in the `print` statement.
- `n` must be at least 0: This indicates that `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is less than or equal to `n`: This variable is mentioned but not used in the `print` statement.

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces. The `*` operator unpacks the range object so that each element is printed as a separate argument to `print`.

Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.

### Explanation:
- If `n` is 0, `range(1, n + 1)` will be `range(1, 1)` which is an empty range, so nothing will be printed.
- If `n` is 1, `range(1, n + 1)` will be `range(1, 2)` which contains only the number 1, so `1` will be printed.
- If `n` is 2, `range(1, n + 1)` will be `range(1, 3)` which contains the numbers 1 and 2, so `1 2` will be printed.
- If `n` is 3, `range(1, n + 1)` will be `range(1, 4)` which contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, so `1 2 3` will be printed.
- And so on...

### Final Output:
The exact numbers printed will depend on the value of `n`, but the format will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer)**
