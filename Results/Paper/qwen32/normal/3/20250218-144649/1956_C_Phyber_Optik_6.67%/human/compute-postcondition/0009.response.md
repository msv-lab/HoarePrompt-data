Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `sum` is `sum + i * n`; `r` is 0; and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**

In simple terms, the value of `sum` has been updated to be the previous value of `sum` plus `i * n`. All other variables retain their initial values.
