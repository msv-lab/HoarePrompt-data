Let's analyze the loop to determine the final state after all iterations. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. The variable `sum` accumulates values based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If the condition is true, `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is set to `i`. If the condition is false, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.

The key is to understand how `r` and `sum` evolve with each iteration:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is `n + r` (initially `j = n` since `r = 0`).
   - `sum` is `0`.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `r` is `0`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration `i` from `1` to `n`, the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is checked.
   - If true, `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - If false, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.

Let's determine the final value of `sum` and `r` after the loop completes:

- The value of `r` will be the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true. This essentially means `r` will be the largest `i` such that `i < (n + 1) / 2`.
- The value of `sum` will be the accumulated sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition is true, and `i * n` for all `i` where the condition is false.

The final `sum` can be calculated as follows:
- If `i < (n + 1) / 2`, `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- If `i >= (n + 1) / 2`, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.

Let's compute the final state:

- `r` will be the largest integer less than `(n + 1) / 2`.
- `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i < (n + 1) / 2` and `i * n` for all `i >= (n + 1) / 2`.

The final `j` remains `n + r`.

To summarize, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is the accumulated sum as described, `n` remains the input integer, and `r` is the largest `i` such that `i < (n + 1) / 2`.**

In natural language, the final state is that `j` is the initial `n` plus the largest `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true. The `sum` is the total accumulated value based on the condition, and `n` remains unchanged.
