To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`sum`**: The problem mentions `sum` is the sum of a series, but it is not explicitly used in the provided `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.
2. **`n`**: It is stated that `n` is at least 2. The exact value of `n` is not specified, but it must be an integer greater than or equal to 2.
3. **`r`**: It is defined as the floor of `n/2`. This means `r = floor(n/2)`.
4. **`j`**: It is described as `j + 1`, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1`. However, the initial value of `j` is not provided. The statement `j = j + 1` suggests that `j` is being incremented by 1 before being printed.

Given the above information, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `j` because its initial value is not provided. However, we know that `j` is being incremented by 1 before being printed.

Let's denote the initial value of `j` as `j_initial`. After the increment, `j` will be `j_initial + 1`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```
This statement will print the number `1`, followed by the value of `j` (which is `j_initial + 1`), and the `end=' '` argument ensures that there is a space at the end of the output instead of a newline.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 [j_initial + 1] (where j_initial + 1 is the incremented value of j)**

Since the initial value of `j` (`j_initial`) is not specified, we express the output in terms of `j_initial + 1`.
