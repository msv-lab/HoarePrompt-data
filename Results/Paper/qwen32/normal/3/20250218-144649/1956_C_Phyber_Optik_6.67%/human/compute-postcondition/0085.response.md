Postcondition: **`sum` is the sum of the series as described, `n` is at least 2, `r` is the floor of `n/2`, and `j` is `j + 1`, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1`. Regardless of whether `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the values of `sum`, `n`, `r`, and `j` remain consistent with the given conditions.**
