Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is the sum of a series (though the specific series is not defined, it is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is at least 2.
- `r` is the floor of `n/2` (which is at least 1 if `n` is at least 2).
- `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is straightforward and prints the integer `1`, the value of `j`, and a space at the end.
- The value of `j` is not specified exactly, but we know it is a variable that holds a value less than or equal to `n`.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, we can only describe it as a value that satisfies the condition `j <= n`.

Output: **1, j (where j is a value less than or equal to n)**
