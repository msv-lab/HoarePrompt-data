Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9. If `a < b < c`, then the current values satisfy `a < b < c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.**
