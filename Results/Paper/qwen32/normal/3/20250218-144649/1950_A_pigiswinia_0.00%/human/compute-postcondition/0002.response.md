The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, its value remains unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.**
