Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the loop has executed `t` times. For each of the `t` iterations, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9. The loop has printed 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the values from the last iteration, and `i` is equal to `t` after the loop finishes.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the program will have printed 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each set of `a`, `b`, and `c` values it received. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain the values from the last iteration, and `i` will be equal to `t`, reflecting that the loop has completed all its iterations.
