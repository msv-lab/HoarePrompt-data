Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

In simple terms: The value of `t` is decreased by 1, while the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. All other conditions and constraints specified in the initial state are still valid.
