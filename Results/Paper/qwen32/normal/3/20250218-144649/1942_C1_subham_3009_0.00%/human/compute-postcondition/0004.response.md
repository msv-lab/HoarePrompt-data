The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state mentions that `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer within a specific range, `x` is an integer within another specific range, and `y` is initially 0. 

The code snippet changes the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` based on the input. The variable `t` is not affected by the code snippet, and the precondition for `n` and `x` remains valid except for their specific values which are now assigned from the input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer.**
