Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The program is executing within the main module.**

In simpler terms, `t` has been assigned the value of the first input integer, which represents the number of test cases. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`) and conditions remain as initially described. The program is still in the main module and ready to process the test cases.
