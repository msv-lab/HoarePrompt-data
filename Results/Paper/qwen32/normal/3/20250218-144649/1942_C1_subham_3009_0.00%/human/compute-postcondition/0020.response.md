To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the changes made to the variables within it.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is initialized to an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are initialized with specific values in each iteration.
   - `arr` is initialized as a list of `x` integers from the input.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - In each iteration:
     - `t` is decremented by 1.
     - `n`, `x`, and `y` are read from the input.
     - `arr` is read from the input and converted to a list of integers.
     - The value of `x - 2` is printed.

3. **Final State**:
   - The loop will execute `t` times.
   - After `t` iterations, `t` will be 0.
   - The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be those of the last iteration.
   - The `arr` will be the list of integers from the last iteration.

Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, we need to focus on the final value of `t` and the state of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` after the last iteration.

### Output State:
- `t` will be 0 because the loop runs until `t` becomes 0.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` will be the values from the last iteration.
- `arr` will be the list of integers from the last iteration.

The specific values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` depend on the last input provided to the loop.

**Output State: **t is 0, n is the n value from the last iteration, x is the x value from the last iteration, y is the y value from the last iteration, and arr is the list of integers from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `t` will be 0, and the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) will hold the values from the final iteration of the loop.
