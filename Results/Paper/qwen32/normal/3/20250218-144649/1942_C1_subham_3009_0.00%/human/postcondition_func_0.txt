The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of chosen vertices, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, the function outputs `x - 2`.
