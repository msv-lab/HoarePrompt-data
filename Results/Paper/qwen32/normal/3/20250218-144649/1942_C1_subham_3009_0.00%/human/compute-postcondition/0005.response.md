The code snippet `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of substrings from the input line.**
