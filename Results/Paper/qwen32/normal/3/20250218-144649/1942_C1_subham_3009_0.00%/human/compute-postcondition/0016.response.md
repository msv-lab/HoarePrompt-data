The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. Since the initial state specifies that `n`, `x`, and `y` are already defined as the first, second, and third input integers respectively, the execution of this code will overwrite these variables with new input values.

Given that the initial state does not provide specific values for `n`, `x`, and `y` beyond them being input integers, and since the code reassigns these variables, we can only state that after execution, `n`, `x`, and `y` will hold the new values provided by the input.

The variable `t` has been decremented by 1 and is greater than 0, and `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the rest are unchanged. These variables are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are the new input integers; `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the rest are unchanged.**
