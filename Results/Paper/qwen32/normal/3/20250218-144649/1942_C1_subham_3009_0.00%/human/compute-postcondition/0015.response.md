Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is the first input integer; `x` is the second input integer; `y` is the third input integer; `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the rest are unchanged.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` has decreased by 1, while all other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
