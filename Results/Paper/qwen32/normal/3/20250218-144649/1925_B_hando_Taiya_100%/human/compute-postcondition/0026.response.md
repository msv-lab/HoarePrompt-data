Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum value of either `i` or `x // i` such that `n` is less than or equal to `i` or `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`.**
