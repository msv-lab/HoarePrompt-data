The code snippet provided updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, `i` has a new value that is one more than its previous value.

Given that `ans` is not defined in the initial state, we need to assume that `ans` has some initial value before this line of code is executed. However, since the problem statement does not specify the initial value of `ans`, we can only describe the effect of the operation in terms of `ans` and `i`.

After the execution of the code, `ans` will hold the maximum value between its previous value and the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `i`.**
