Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8; `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now the next integer value (i.e., `i` from the previous state plus 1); `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and the new value of `i`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is updated to be the larger of its previous value and the new value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
