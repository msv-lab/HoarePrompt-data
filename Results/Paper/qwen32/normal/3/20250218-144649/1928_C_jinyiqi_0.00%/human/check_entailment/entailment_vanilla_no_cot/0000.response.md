Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Undefined Function**: The function `func_1` is used but not defined in the provided code. This would result in a `NameError` if the code were run.

2. **Logic Errors**: The logic for determining the valid values of `k` is flawed and incomplete. The conditions and calculations do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

3. **Incomplete Output Handling**: The program does not output the results for each test case. It builds a list of potential `k` values but does not print them.

4. **Integer Division**: The program uses `/` for division, which results in a float. Since `k` must be an integer, the results should be calculated using integer division `//` or converted to integers after division.

5. **Range of `k` Values**: The program does not correctly consider the range of possible `k` values. The problem requires finding all `k` such that the described pattern fits the given `n` and `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_valid_ks(n, x):
    valid_ks = set()
    
    # Check for k in the form (n + x - 2) = (2k - 2) * m
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        for m in range(1, (n + x - 2) // 2 + 1):
            if (n + x - 2) % (2 * m) == 0:
                k = (n + x - 2) // (2 * m) + 1
                if k > 1 and k >= x:
                    valid_ks.add(k)
    
    # Check for k in the form (n - x) = (2k - 2) * m
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        for m in range(1, (n - x) // 2 + 1):
            if (n - x) % (2 * m) == 0:
                k = (n - x) // (2 * m) + 1
                if k > 1 and k >= x:
                    valid_ks.add(k)
    
    return len(valid_ks)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(find_valid_ks(n, x))
```

This corrected version defines a function `find_valid_ks` that calculates the valid `k` values for each test case and prints the count of such values.
