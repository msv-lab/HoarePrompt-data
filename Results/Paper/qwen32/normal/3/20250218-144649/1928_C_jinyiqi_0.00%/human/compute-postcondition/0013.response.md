Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ x < n â‰¤ 10^9; `i` is incremented by 1; `output1` includes the new value of `i`; `output2` includes the integer value of `x / i`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the integer division of `x` by the new value of `i` is appended to `output2`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
