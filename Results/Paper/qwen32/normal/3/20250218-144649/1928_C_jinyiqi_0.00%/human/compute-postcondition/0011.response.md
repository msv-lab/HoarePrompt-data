To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)`. Therefore, only the variable `i` can be adjusted.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- If `x % i == 0`, `output1` is a list with the new element `i-1` appended, and `output2` is a list with an additional element `int(x / i)`.

Let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be within the range `[1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, ensuring `i` is still within the range `[1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)`**.
