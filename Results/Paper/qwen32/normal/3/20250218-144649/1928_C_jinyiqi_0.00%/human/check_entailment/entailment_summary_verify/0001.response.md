Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine how many possible values of `k` there are for which Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received during the settling match the pattern described. The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the numbers assigned follow a specific sequence.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, reading `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (the number Vasya received).
3. Checking two conditions related to `n` and `x`:
   - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
   - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
4. Using a function `func_1` to find divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
5. Filtering these divisors based on the condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
6. Collecting valid `k` values and removing duplicates.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is intended to find divisors of a number, but it returns the divisors in a reversed order and concatenates the list of divisors with its reverse. This is unnecessary and can lead to duplicates. The function summary correctly describes the function's behavior, but the implementation can be simplified and made more efficient.
2. **Appending Valid `k` Values**: After checking the conditions and finding valid `k` values, the program appends them to the `output` list but does not print or return this output for each test case. This is a critical issue, as the program needs to output the number of unique valid `k` values for each test case.
3. **Condition Checks**: The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are checked, but the logic for determining `k` from these conditions is not entirely clear and seems incomplete. Specifically, the logic for deriving `k` from the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` needs to be verified.
4. **Output Handling**: The program calculates the valid `k` values but does not handle the output correctly. It should print the number of unique valid `k` values for each test case.

### Correctness
Given the issues outlined above, the program is not correctly implementing the logic to determine and output the number of valid `k` values for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be fixed to correctly determine and output the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
