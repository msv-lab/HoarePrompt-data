Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers. If `x < k - 1`, the value of `a` remains unchanged if it is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If `x == k - 1`, the state remains unchanged. If `x > k - 1`, `k` is set to 3, `x` is set to 5, `a` is set to 7, and `z` is set to 8. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to 8. Otherwise, `a` is less than 8.**
