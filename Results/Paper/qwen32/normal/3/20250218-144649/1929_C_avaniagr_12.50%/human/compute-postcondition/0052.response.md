The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides values for variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `z`, but these variables are not used within the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Values:**
   - `k` is 3.
   - `x` is 5.
   - `a` is 7.
   - `z` is 8.
   - It is also mentioned that `a` is less than `z`, which is true (7 < 8).

2. **Examine the Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
   - This statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without referencing any of the variables.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since the `print` statement does not use any variables, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
