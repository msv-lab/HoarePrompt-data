The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `x` because `i` is the loop variable that gets assigned values from the range function. The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value, which happens if `x + 1` is greater than 0. Therefore, `x` must be at least -1 for the loop to execute.

The variables `k`, `a`, and `z` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be at least -1, `a` is the third integer from the input, `z` is 0**
