You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step based on the problem description to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Sasha wants to ensure that he can always reach any number of coins `n` by making bets at the casino with the following conditions:
1. If he wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
2. If he loses, his coins decrease by `y`.
3. He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
4. He starts with `a` coins.

### Key Observations:
- **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
  - Sasha can use a strategy where he bets `1` coin after a win and `2` coins after a loss.
  - To ensure he can always recover from `x` losses, he needs to have enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses.
  - The worst-case scenario is losing `x` times in a row, which would cost him `1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(x-1)` coins.
  - This sum is `2^x - 1`, which is less than `x + 1` when `x < k - 1` (since `k - 1` is at least `2` and `2^x - 1` grows much faster than `x + 1` for `x >= 2`).
  - Therefore, if `a >= x + 1`, he can always recover.

- **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
  - The strategy is similar, but the worst-case scenario is more complex.
  - Here, the worst-case scenario involves a more complex series of losses and recoveries.
  - The program suggests that if `a >= x + 3`, Sasha can always recover.
  - This is a heuristic based on the problem constraints and needs to be verified through the problem's logic.

- **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
  - The program calculates a more complex scenario using a loop.
  - It calculates the total amount of coins needed to cover the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses.
  - The loop iteratively calculates the amount needed to cover the losses, and if `a` is greater than or equal to this amount, Sasha can always recover.

### Program Analysis:
The program correctly handles the three cases described above:
1. When `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`.
2. When `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 3`.
3. When `x > k - 1`, it calculates the total amount needed to cover the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and checks if `a` is sufficient.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly implement the logic based on the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly handles all edge cases and implements the logic based on the problem description.
Correctness: **True**
