Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers as read from the input; `t` must be greater than 0. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, the condition of the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, the else part is executed. In both cases, the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and the condition that `t` is greater than 0 are preserved.**
