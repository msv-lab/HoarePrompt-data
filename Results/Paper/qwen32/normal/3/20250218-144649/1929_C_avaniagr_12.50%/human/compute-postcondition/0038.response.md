In the given task, the initial state describes the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` as integers derived from the input. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not reference any of the variables `k`, `x`, or `a`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `k`, `x`, or `a`.

Output: **YES**
