The `print('YES')` statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `z` because the print statement is explicitly printing the string 'YES' and does not reference any of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides values for `k`, `x`, `a`, and `z`, but these values are not used in the print statement.
2. The print statement is `print('YES')`, which means it will output the string 'YES' exactly as it is written.

Output: **YES**
