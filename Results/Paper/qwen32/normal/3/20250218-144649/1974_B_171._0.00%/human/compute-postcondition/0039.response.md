Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, and `char` is `next_char`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` has an additional element `mapping[next_char]` appended to it. Otherwise, `c` is the ASCII value of the first character from 'a' to 'z' that was not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` includes the entry `{chr(c): next_char}`, and `decoded` now contains the character `chr(c)`.**
