### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the original assessment based on the provided problem description, code, and function summary.

**Problem Recap:**
- The original string `s` is encoded by creating an auxiliary string `r` which consists of unique characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
- Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

**Decoding Process:**
- To decode, we need to:
  1. Identify the unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sort them to form the `r` string.
  2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
  3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string `b`.

**Program Analysis:**
- The provided program does not follow the correct decoding process.
- Instead of forming the `r` string and creating a symmetric mapping, it attempts to map each encoded character to the first unused lowercase Latin letter, which is incorrect.

**Function Summary:**
- The function summary states that `func_1(encoded)` returns a new string where each unique character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z' in the order of their first appearance. This does not align with the required decoding process.

**Issues in the Program:**
1. **Incorrect Mapping Construction:** The program assigns each unique character in the encoded string to the first unused character from 'a' to 'z', which is not the correct approach.
2. **Lack of Symmetric Character Calculation:** The program does not calculate the symmetric character based on the `r` string.

**Correct Approach:**
1. Identify the unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sort them to form the `r` string.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string `b`.

**Conclusion:**
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string based on the described encoding process. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
