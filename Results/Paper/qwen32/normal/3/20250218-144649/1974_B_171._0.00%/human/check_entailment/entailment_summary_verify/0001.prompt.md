You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function takes a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each unique character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z' in the order of their first appearance.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
The problem describes an encoding process that involves:
1. Creating an auxiliary string `r` from the original string `s`, consisting of unique characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
2. Encoding each character of `s` by finding its symmetric character in `r`.

The task is to reverse this process and decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.

### Program Analysis:
The given code attempts to decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s` using the following approach:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
3. It calls `func_1(encoded)` to decode the string `b`.
4. `func_1(encoded)` initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` and an empty list `decoded`.
5. For each character in the encoded string `b`, it checks if the character is already in the `mapping` dictionary:
   - If it is, it appends the corresponding value (original character) from the dictionary to `decoded`.
   - If it is not, it iterates through all lowercase Latin letters to find the first one not already used in the dictionary. It then maps this character to the current encoded character and appends the original character to `decoded`.
6. Finally, it joins the list `decoded` into a string and returns it.

### Issues in the Program:
The program does not correctly implement the decoding process. Specifically:
1. **Incorrect Mapping Construction**: The program attempts to map each encoded character to the first unused lowercase Latin letter, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach involves determining the `r` string based on the unique characters of the encoded string and then finding the symmetric character for each encoded character.
2. **Lack of Symmetric Character Calculation**: The program does not calculate the symmetric character based on the `r` string. Instead, it incorrectly assigns characters without considering the symmetric relationship.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly decode the encoded string:
1. Identify the unique characters in the encoded string and sort them to form the `r` string.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string based on the described encoding process. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
