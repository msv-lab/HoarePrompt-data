The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will terminate the most inner loop or conditional block it is placed in. However, since there is no loop or conditional block shown in the context, the `break` statement does not affect any of the variables directly. Therefore, none of the variables (`encoded`, `decoded`, `char`, `c`, `mapping`) will be changed by this statement.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry `'b': char`), `c` is 98, `mapping` includes the entry `'b': char`.**
