The code assigns the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the `mapping` dictionary. This means `mapping` now contains the entry `{chr(c): char}`. The values of `encoded`, `decoded`, and `char` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is not affected by this assignment, but the condition `c + 1 <= ord('z')` is still valid for future considerations.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added), and `mapping` now contains one entry `{chr(c): char}`.**
