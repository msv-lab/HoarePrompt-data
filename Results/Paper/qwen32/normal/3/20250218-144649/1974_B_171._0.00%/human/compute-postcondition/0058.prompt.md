Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `mapping` is an empty dictionary; `decoded` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for char in encoded:
    if char in mapping:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    else:
        for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
            if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                mapping[chr(c)] = char
                break
        decoded.append(chr(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` is a list containing the value `mapping[char]`. If `char` is not in `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to `{'a': char}`, and `decoded` is a list containing one additional element which is `chr(c)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, and `char` is `next_char`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` has an additional element `mapping[next_char]` appended to it. Otherwise, `c` is the ASCII value of the first character from 'a' to 'z' that was not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` includes the entry `{chr(c): next_char}`, and `decoded` now contains the character `chr(c)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, `char` is `next_next_char`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` has an additional element `mapping[next_next_char]` appended to it. Otherwise, `mapping` includes a new entry `{chr(c): next_next_char}` where `chr(c)` is the first lowercase Latin letter not already in `mapping.values()`, and `decoded` now contains the character `chr(c)` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
