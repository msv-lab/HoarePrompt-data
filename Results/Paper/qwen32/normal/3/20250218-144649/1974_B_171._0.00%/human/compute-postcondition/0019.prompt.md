Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping`
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added). If `chr(c)` was not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` now contains one entry `{chr(c): char}` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added). If `chr(c)` was not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` now contains one entry `{chr(c): char}` and the loop or conditional statement is broken out of. If `chr(c)` was already in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry `'b': char` if added), `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` includes the entry `'b': char`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
