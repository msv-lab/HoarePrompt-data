Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string based on the described algorithm. The function `func_1` attempts to decode the string by assigning unique characters from 'a' to 'z' to each new character encountered in the encoded string. However, this approach does not follow the encoding process described in the problem statement.

The correct decoding process should involve:
1. Identifying the unique characters in the encoded string and sorting them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
2. Creating a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second maps to the second last, and so on).
3. Using this mapping to decode the original string from the encoded string.

The provided function does not perform these steps. Instead, it assigns arbitrary characters from 'a' to 'z' to each unique character in the encoded string, which does not guarantee that the original string is correctly reconstructed.

Correctness: **False**
