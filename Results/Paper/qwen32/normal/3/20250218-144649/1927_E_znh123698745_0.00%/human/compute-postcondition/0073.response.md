Let's analyze the given task step by step.

The loop provided is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is `i + 1`

In the loop head, the variables `i` and `n` are involved. The `range(1, n)` indicates that `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, stopping before `n`.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State before the Loop Start**: 
   - `i` starts from 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has already been incremented by 1 from its value at the start of the previous iteration).

3. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will have the value of `i + 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be the value of `i + 1` from the previous iteration.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure the loop continues.

### Final State:
Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented again, so `i` will be `i + 2` from the initial start of the loop.

However, to directly follow the state transition:
- If `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will simply be `i + 1` (from the perspective of the loop's progression).

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`**
