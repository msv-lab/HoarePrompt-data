Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 4, `k` is the second input integer, `i` is 4. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, then `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive with the last element decremented by 1 and `answer` is `n`. Otherwise, `array` remains a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `answer` contains the element at `array[a[0]]` with `a[0]` incremented by 1.**
