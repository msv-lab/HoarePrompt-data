The code snippet appends the element at the index specified by `a[0]` from the `array` to the `answer` list. This means that the `answer` list will now include the element from `array` at the position `a[0]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `k` is the second input integer.
- `i` is `n`.
- `array` and `answer` remain as they were at the end of the last iteration.

The only change is that `answer` will have an additional element, which is `array[a[0]]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `i` is `n`, `array` remains unchanged, `answer` now includes `array[a[0]]`.**
