Let's analyze the loop and its behavior to determine the final output state.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Here's the breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. If `i` is odd (`(-1) ** i == -1`), the loop appends `array[a[-1]]` to `answer` and decreases `a[-1]` by 1.
2. If `i` is even (`(-1) ** i == 1`), the loop appends `array[a[0]]` to `answer` and increases `a[0]` by 1.

Initially:
- `array` is `[1, 2, ..., n]`
- `answer` is `[1]`
- `a` is `[1, -1]`

Let's see how the loop modifies `answer` and `a` over the iterations.

### Iteration Breakdown

#### Iteration 1 (i = 1, odd):
- `answer` becomes `[1, array[a[-1]]] = [1, array[-1]] = [1, n]`
- `a` becomes `[1, -2]`

#### Iteration 2 (i = 2, even):
- `answer` becomes `[1, n, array[a[0]]] = [1, n, array[1]] = [1, n, 2]`
- `a` becomes `[2, -2]`

#### Iteration 3 (i = 3, odd):
- `answer` becomes `[1, n, 2, array[a[-1]]] = [1, n, 2, array[-2]] = [1, n, 2, n-1]`
- `a` becomes `[2, -3]`

This pattern continues until `i = n-1`.

### Final State

- When `i` is odd, the last element of `a` (`a[-1]`) is used to index `array` and append the corresponding element to `answer`. Then `a[-1]` is decremented.
- When `i` is even, the first element of `a` (`a[0]`) is used to index `array` and append the corresponding element to `answer`. Then `a[0]` is incremented.

After `n-1` iterations, `answer` will contain `n` elements:
- The first element is `1`.
- The second element is `n`.
- The third element is `2`.
- The fourth element is `n-1`.
- And so on, alternating between the largest remaining element and the smallest remaining element.

The final `a` will be `[n, -n]` because:
- `a[0]` is incremented `n//2` times (if `n` is even) or `(n-1)//2` times (if `n` is odd).
- `a[-1]` is decremented `(n-1)//2` times (if `n` is even) or `n//2` times (if `n` is odd).

Thus, the final state of `answer` is `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ...]`.

### Output State

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers in the order [1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., m], where m is the middle element if `n` is odd, and `a` is a list containing the integers [n, -n].**

In simpler terms, the `answer` list will alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements of `array`, starting with `1` and `n`, and `a` will end up as `[n, -n]`.
