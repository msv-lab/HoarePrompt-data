The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than 4. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 5. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 5.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 5, `k` is the second input integer, `i` is 5**
