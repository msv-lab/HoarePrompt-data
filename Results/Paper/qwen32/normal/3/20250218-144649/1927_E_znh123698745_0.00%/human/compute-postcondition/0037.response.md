The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element at the index specified by `a[0]` from the `array` to the `answer` list. Given that `a[0]` is `1` and `array` contains integers from `1` to `n` inclusive, the element at index `1` of `array` is `2`. Therefore, `2` is appended to `answer`.

The initial state specifies that `answer` is `[1]`. After appending `2` to `answer`, `answer` becomes `[1, 2]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `array`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is [1, 2], `a` is [1, -1]**.
