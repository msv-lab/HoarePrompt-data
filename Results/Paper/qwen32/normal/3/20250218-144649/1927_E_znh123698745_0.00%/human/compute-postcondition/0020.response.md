The code appends the element at the index specified by the last element of the list `a` to the list `answer`. Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `array` and `answer` are updated based on the operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `i` is `n`, `array` remains as it was at the end of the last iteration, `answer` now includes the element at the index `a[-1]` from `array`.**
