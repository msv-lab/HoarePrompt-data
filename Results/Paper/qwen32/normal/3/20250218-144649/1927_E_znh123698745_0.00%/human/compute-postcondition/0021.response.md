The value of the last element in the list `a` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `array`, and `answer`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `i` is `n`, `array` remains as it was at the end of the last iteration, `answer` now includes the element at the index `a[-1]` from `array`, and the last element of `a` is decreased by 1.**
