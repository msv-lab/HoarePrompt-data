The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `answer` are not directly modified by this operation, so their states remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[-1]]`; the last element of `a` is decremented by 1.**
