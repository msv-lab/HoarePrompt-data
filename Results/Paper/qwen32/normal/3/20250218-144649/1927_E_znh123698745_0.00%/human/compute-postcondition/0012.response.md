Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, then `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `n`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2. Otherwise, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `a` is a list containing the integers 2 and -1.**
