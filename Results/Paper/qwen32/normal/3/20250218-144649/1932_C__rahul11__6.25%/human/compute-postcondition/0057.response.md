The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable that iterates over each element in the list `arr`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `i` changes.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken the value of the last element that was processed from `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next element in `arr`.

Let's denote the current value of `i` as `arr[k]`, where `k` is the current index in `arr`. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be updated to `arr[k+1]`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can express the state in terms of the next element of `arr` that `i` will take. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is `ans * i`; `c` is `n`; `l` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`; `r` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`; `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current value of `i`**

However, to be more precise, we can denote the next element in `arr` as `arr[k+1]` where `k` is the current index of `i` in `arr`. Since we don't have the exact index, we can just denote it as the next element.
