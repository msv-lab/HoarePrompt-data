The given Python code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `arr`. 

Given the initial state, `arr` was previously a list of integers, but it is now being reassigned based on the new input. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `res`, `ans`, `c`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters; `res` is a list where the first element is `1 % m` and the next `n - 1` elements are the intermediate values of `ans % m % MOD` after each division; `ans` is 1; `c` is `n`; `l` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`; `r` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`.**
