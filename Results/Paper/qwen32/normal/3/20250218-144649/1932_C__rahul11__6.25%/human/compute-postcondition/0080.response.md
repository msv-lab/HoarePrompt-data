The code snippet increments the variable `l` by 1. This change affects the value of `l` but does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Given the initial state, the value of `l` is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that it is used in the expression `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` to index into the `arr` list. After the code snippet executes, `l` will be `l + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the `c`-th element updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `k` is 2; `ans` is updated to `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`; `l` is `l + 1`.**
