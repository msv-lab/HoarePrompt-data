The code snippet `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` modifies the value of `ans` by first performing integer division of `ans` by `arr[l]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are zeros; `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `s[k]` is 'L'**.
