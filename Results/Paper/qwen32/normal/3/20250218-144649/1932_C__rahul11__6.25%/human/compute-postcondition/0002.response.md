The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state does not specify the values of `n` and `m`, so they are now assigned based on the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.**
