The code snippet `ans *= i` updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with the value of `i`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially `i`, so after the execution of the code, `ans` will be `i * i` or `i^2`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is `i * i`; `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
