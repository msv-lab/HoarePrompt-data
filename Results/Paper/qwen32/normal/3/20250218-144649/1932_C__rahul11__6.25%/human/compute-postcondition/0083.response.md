The code snippet provided is `r -= 1`, which decrements the value of `r` by 1. No other variables are affected by this statement.

Given the initial state, the only change is to the variable `r`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and the element at index `c` updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `k` is 2; `ans` is updated to `(previous_ans // arr[r]) % MOD`; `r` is decremented by 1.**
