Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer read from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element is `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is `(previous_ans // arr[r]) % MOD`, `c` is 3, `l` is 2 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1, `r` is `r - 1`, `s[k]` is either 'L' or not 'L', `k` is `k + 1`, `res[2]` is `ans % m % MOD`**.

Explanation in natural language: The value of `r` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
