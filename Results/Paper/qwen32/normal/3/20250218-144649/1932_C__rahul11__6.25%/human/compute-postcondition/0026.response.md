The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is initially set to `n - 1`. After the decrement, `r` will be `n - 2`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is `(ans % m % MOD)`; `ans` is `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 2`; and `s[k]` is not equal to 'L'.**
