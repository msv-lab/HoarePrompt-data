Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is `i * i * i`; `i` is the next element in `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of its previous value (`i * i`) and the current value of `i` from the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
