Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list with the first element as `ans % m % MOD` and the second element also as `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are zeros; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[n-1]` modulo `MOD`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 2`; `s[k]` is not 'L'**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so if `r` was initially `n - 1`, it is now `n - 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
