Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are `0`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]` modulo `MOD`; `c` is 2; `l` is either 1 or 0; `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `k` is `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]`, taken modulo `MOD`. All other variables retain their initial values.
