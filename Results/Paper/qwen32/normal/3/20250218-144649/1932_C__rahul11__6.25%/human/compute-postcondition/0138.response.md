Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, the third element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are `0`. `c` is 3; `k` is `k + 1`; `ans` is `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` has been updated to `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD`. All other variables retain their previous values.
