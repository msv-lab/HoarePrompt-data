The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to the value `10 ** 9`. This means that the list `ans` now contains `n` copies of the integer `1000000000`. The variable `arr` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500; `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the resulting array `a`, such that 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each equal to 1000000000.**
