Given the initial state, `ans[i]` is initially `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, and `ans[i + 1]` is initially `1000000000 - arr[i + 1]`.

The code snippet `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the current value of `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. Since `ans[i + 1]` is already defined as `1000000000 - arr[i + 1]`, the new value of `ans[i]` will be `(1000000000 - arr[i + 1]) - arr[i]`.

Thus, the updated value of `ans[i]` will be `1000000000 - arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

The other values of `ans` and `arr` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be at least 5 and `i` is `n - 4` still holds.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` must be at least 5; `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each equal to 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i + 1] - arr[i]` and `ans[i + 1]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i + 1]`; `i` is `n - 4`.**
