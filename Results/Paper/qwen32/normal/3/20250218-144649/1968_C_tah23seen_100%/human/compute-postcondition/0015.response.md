Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of `n-1` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 500, and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the resulting list `ans`. It returns a list `ans` of `n` integers where each element `ans[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-2`) is calculated as `1000000000 - sum(arr[i:n-1])`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` is `1000000000`.**
