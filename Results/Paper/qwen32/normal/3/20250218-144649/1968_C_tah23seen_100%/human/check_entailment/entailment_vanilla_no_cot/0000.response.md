Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate an array `a` such that `a[i] % a[i-1] == x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

The current implementation initializes `ans` with `10 ** 9` for all elements and then attempts to fill in the values from the end to the beginning using `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This approach does not guarantee that the modulo condition is satisfied.

Here is a corrected approach:

1. Set `a_1` to any value greater than `x_2` (since `x_2 = a_2 % a_1` and `a_2` must be at least `x_2`).
2. For each subsequent `a_i`, set it to `a_{i-1} + x_i` (or any other value that satisfies `a_i % a_{i-1} == x_i`).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1  # a_1 can be any value greater than x_2
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i]  # a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i
    return ans
```

In this corrected version, `a_1` is set to `arr[0] + 1` and each subsequent `a_i` is set to `a_{i-1} + arr[i]`, which ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} == arr[i]`.
