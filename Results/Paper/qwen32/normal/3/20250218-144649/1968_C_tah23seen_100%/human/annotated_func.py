#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer representing the number of elements in the resulting array a, such that 2 <= n <= 500. The length of arr is n-1.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the resulting array `a`, such that 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[i] = 1000000000 - sum(arr[i:n-1])` for each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, and `ans[n-1] = 1000000000`; `i` is `-1`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of `n` integers where each element `ans[i]` is calculated as `1000000000 - sum(arr[i:n-1])` for `i` from 0 to `n-2`, and `ans[n-1]` is `1000000000`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of `n-1` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 500, and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the resulting list `ans`. It returns a list `ans` of `n` integers where each element `ans[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-2`) is calculated as `1000000000 - sum(arr[i:n-1])`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` is `1000000000`.
