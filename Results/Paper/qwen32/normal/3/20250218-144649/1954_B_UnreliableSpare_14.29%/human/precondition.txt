The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array. The provided array is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
