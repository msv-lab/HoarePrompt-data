You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It checks if all elements in the list are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements in the list that are not equal to the first element.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1()` to process each test case.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It first checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the previous one. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - It initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to keep track of the minimum length of a continuous subsequence of identical elements.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the lengths of contiguous subsequences of identical elements and updates `ans` with the minimum length found.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the count of the last contiguous subsequence.
   - If `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), it prints `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum length of a contiguous subsequence of identical elements.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies if all elements in the array are the same and correctly returns `-1` in that case.
   - However, the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed.
   - The program only considers the length of contiguous subsequences of identical elements, but this does not necessarily give the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful is `3` (removing the three `3`s around the `5`), but the program might return `1` (the length of the subsequence `[5]`), which is incorrect.
   - The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated analysis of the structure of the array and the positions of differing elements.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
