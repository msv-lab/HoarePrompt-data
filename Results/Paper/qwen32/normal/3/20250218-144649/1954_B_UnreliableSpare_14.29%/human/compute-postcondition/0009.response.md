The code snippet provided only initializes a new variable `flag` to `False`. None of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `i`) are modified. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `flag` is False**.
