The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cnt` is 2 if `arr[0]` equals `val` and `arr[1]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 1. After the code `cnt += 1` is executed, `cnt` will be 3 if `arr[0]` equals `val` and `arr[1]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` will be 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`flag` is True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 3 if `arr[0]` equals `val` and `arr[1]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')` if `arr[0]` equals `val`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `arr[0]` equals `val` and `arr[1]` does not equal `val`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
