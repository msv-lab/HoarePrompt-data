The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 3, and it should still be less than `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `i` is 3**
