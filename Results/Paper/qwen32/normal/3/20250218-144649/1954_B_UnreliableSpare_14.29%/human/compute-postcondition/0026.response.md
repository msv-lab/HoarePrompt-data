The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Since `cnt` is initially 1 if `arr[0]` equals `val`, after the increment, `cnt` will be 2 if `arr[0]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` will be 1 (which is not possible given the initial condition that `cnt` is 0 only if `arr[0]` does not equal `val`).

Output State: **`flag` is True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 2 if `arr[0]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` remains 1 (which is not applicable here), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')` if `arr[0]` equals `val`, otherwise `ans` is `0`**.
