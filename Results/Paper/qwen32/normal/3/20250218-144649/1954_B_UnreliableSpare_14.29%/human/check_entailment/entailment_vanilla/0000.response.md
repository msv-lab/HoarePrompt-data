Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1()` to process each test case.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It first checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the previous one. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - It initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to keep track of the minimum length of a continuous subsequence of identical elements.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the lengths of contiguous subsequences of identical elements and updates `ans` with the minimum length found.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the count of the last contiguous subsequence.
   - If `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), it prints `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum length of a contiguous subsequence of identical elements.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies if all elements in the array are the same and correctly returns `-1` in that case.
   - However, the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed.
   - The program only considers the length of contiguous subsequences of identical elements, but this does not necessarily give the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful is `3` (removing the three `3`s around the `5`), but the program might return `1` (the length of the subsequence `[5]`), which is incorrect.
   - The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated analysis of the structure of the array and the positions of differing elements.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
