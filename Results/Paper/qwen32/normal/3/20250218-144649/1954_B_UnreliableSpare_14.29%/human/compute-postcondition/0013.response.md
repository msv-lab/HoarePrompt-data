The provided code snippet initializes a variable `flag` to `False`. The initial state includes variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `arr`, and the variable `i` with a value of 3. Since the code only changes the value of `flag`, the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `i` is 3, `flag` is False**.
