Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input. `flag` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `flag` has been set to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
