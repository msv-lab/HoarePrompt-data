Output State: **The loop has executed `q` times. For each of the `q` iterations, the program reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, and prints 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise it prints 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state except that `i` is `n + 1` as specified.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all `q` iterations, the program will have processed `q` pairs of integers `(x, y)`, and for each pair, it will have determined whether to print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the given conditions. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `i` will remain the same, with `i` specifically being `n + 1`.
