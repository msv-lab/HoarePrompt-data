### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to determine if a given subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` is "good".
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that:
     1. The sum of elements in `c[l_i:r_i+1]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
     2. Each element in `c[l_i:r_i+1]` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
     3. All elements in `b` are greater than 0.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a subarray to be "good", the sum of its elements must be at least equal to the length of the subarray (since all elements in `b` must be positive integers, the smallest sum we can achieve with `b` is the length of the subarray).
   - If any element in the subarray is `1`, it cannot be different from `1` in `b` while keeping `b_i > 0`. So, if the subarray contains a `1` and its length is greater than 1, it cannot be "good".
   - If the subarray has a length of `1` and its element is `1`, it cannot be "good" because the only possible `b` would be `[1]`, which is not different from `c`.
   - If the subarray has a length of `1` and its element is greater than `1`, it can be "good" because we can construct `b` as an array with a single element that is different from `c`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It constructs an array `a` which is the prefix sum of the input array `c` with an extra `0` at the beginning.
   - It constructs an array `b` where each element is either `1` or `2` based on whether the corresponding element in `c` is greater than `1` or not. The prefix sum of `b` is then computed.
   - For each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b` or if the subarray has a length of `1`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO", otherwise, it prints "YES".

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program incorrectly determines the "goodness" of a subarray by comparing the prefix sums of `a` and `b`. It does not correctly account for the conditions specified in the problem.
   - The program prints the prefix sum array `a` which is not required and can lead to incorrect results.
   - The logic for determining if a subarray is "good" is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the subarray contains a `1` and has a length greater than `1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the program's logic, it is incorrect based on the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**
