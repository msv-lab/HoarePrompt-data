To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is only `i`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n + 1`, so at the start of each iteration, `i` should be the next integer after the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4;
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5;
- `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5;
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9;
- `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input;
- For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`;
- `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + x`, with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2;
- `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2;
- `i` is the loop variable.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `1 ≤ k < n + 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + x`, with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + x`, with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `i` is incremented by 1**.
