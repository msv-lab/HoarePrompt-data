The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `c` of `n` integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, specifying a range in the list `c`. The function determines and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the comparison of the sum of elements and a derived value within the specified range of `c`.
