The code snippet provided updates the value of `b[i]` based on the value of `a[i]`. Specifically, `b[i]` is the sum of `b[i - 1]` and `x`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` and 2 otherwise. This means that `b[i]` accumulates a value that depends on whether the elements of `a` are greater than 1 or not.

Given the initial state, `b` is already initialized such that `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is calculated based on the values of `a[i]`. The code snippet provided updates `b[i]` for a specific `i`.

Since the initial state specifies that `b` is already constructed up to `b[i-1]`, the only change is the update of `b[i]` to `b[i - 1] + x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + x`, with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `i` is incremented by 1; `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `b[i]` is updated to `b[i - 1] + x`.**
