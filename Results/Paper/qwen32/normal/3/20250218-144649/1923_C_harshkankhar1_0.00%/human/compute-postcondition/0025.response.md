Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `c`, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The list `c` contains `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n), which specify a range in the list `c`. The function processes each query to determine some result based on the elements in the specified range of `c` for each query.**
