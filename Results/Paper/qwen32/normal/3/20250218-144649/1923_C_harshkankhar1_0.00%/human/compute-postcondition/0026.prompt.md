You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + x`, with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `i` is `n + 1`; all iterations of the loop have finished.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: 0 0 0 ... 0 (where there are n+1 zeros)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `q` times. For each of the `q` iterations, the program reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, and prints 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise it prints 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state except that `i` is `n + 1` as specified.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `c`, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The list `c` contains `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n), which specify a range in the list `c`. The function processes each query to determine some result based on the elements in the specified range of `c` for each query.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
