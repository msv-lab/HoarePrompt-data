The given code snippet initializes a list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.**
