Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for the given number of rounds. Here are the issues:

1. The function `default_value` is not defined. The `defaultdict` should be initialized with a default factory function, such as `int` which will default to 0 for integer counts.

2. The logic for calculating the number of additional problems is incorrect. The program adds `m - d[val]` to the answer for each difficulty level, but it should only do so if `d[val] < m` because if `d[val]` is already greater than or equal to `m`, no additional problems of that difficulty are needed. Additionally, the program should only consider the 7 difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') and not all keys in the dictionary.

3. The program does not account for the fact that each round requires one problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. Thus, the number of additional problems needed for a given difficulty level is `max(0, m - d[val])`, but this needs to be done for all 7 levels, not just the ones present in the input.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def default_value():
    return 0

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for level in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[level] < m:
            ans += m - d[level]
    print(ans)
```

This version initializes the `defaultdict` with a function that returns 0, iterates over all 7 difficulty levels, and calculates the number of additional problems needed for each level.
