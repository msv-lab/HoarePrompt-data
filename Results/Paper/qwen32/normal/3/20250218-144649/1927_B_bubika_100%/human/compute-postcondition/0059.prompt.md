Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. It is guaranteed that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    b = [0] * 26
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `r` will be a string where each character is determined by the corresponding index in `s` from the string `a`.
- `b` will have updated counts reflecting the number of times each index (0 to 25) appears in `s`.

Let's assume `s = [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...]` for illustration:
- After all iterations, `r` would be "aaabcd..." where each character corresponds to the index in `s`.
- `b` would be `[3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]` reflecting the counts of each index in `s`.

Since the specific values of `s` are not provided, we can't determine the exact string `r` and the exact counts in `b`. However, the general form of the final state is:

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is a string consisting of the character at index `0` of list `a` repeated `n` times; `b` is a list of 26 zeros with the first element being `n`; `t` is `k + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have `n` elements, all of which are `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is a string formed by concatenating characters from `a` based on the values in `s`; `b` is a list of 26 integers where each index `x` is incremented by the count of `x` in `s`; `t` is `k + 2`; `n` is `input_integer`; `s` is the list of integers derived from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
