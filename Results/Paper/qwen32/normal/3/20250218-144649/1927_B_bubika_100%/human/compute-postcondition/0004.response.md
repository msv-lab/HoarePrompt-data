The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `s`. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `s` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers.**
