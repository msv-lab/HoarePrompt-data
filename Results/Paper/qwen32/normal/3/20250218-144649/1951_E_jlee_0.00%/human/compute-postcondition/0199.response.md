Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer between 1 and 10,000.
2. **`string`**: A newly input string.
3. **`s`**: A list of characters from the `string`.
4. **`n`**: The length of `s` (and thus `string`), which is at least 1.
5. **`x`**: The first character of the `string`.
6. **`j`**: Set to 0.
7. **`count`**: Greater than 1.
8. **`count2`**: Equal to `count`.
9. **`done`**: A boolean value that is set to `True` if the first character of `s` at index `j` is not equal to the last character of `s` at index `n - 1 - j`. Otherwise, `done` remains `False`.
10. **`s[j]`**: Not equal to `x`.

### Key Observations:
- Since `j` is 0, `s[j]` is the same as `s[0]`, which is the first character of the string, `x`.
- The condition `s[j]` is not equal to `x` is contradictory because `s[j]` is `x` when `j` is 0. Therefore, there seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement as described. However, we will proceed with the given conditions and assume the conditions are meant to imply certain logic that we need to deduce.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

- **`string[:j - 1]`**: Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1. In Python, `string[:-1]` gives all characters of the string except the last one.
- **`string[j - 1:]`**: Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1. In Python, `string[-1:]` gives the last character of the string.

### Output Calculation:
- Given `j` is 0, `string[:j - 1]` translates to `string[:-1]`, which is the string without the last character.
- `string[j - 1:]` translates to `string[-1:]`, which is the last character of the string.

### Final Output:
Output: **string[:-1], string[-1:] (where string[:-1] is the string without the last character and string[-1:] is the last character of the string)**

However, to make it more precise and clear, let's denote the string as `str_val` for better readability:
Output: **str_val[:-1], str_val[-1:] (where str_val is the input string)**
