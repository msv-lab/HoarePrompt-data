The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state and the values of the variables do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it directly prints the string `'YES'` without referencing any variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
- The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `string` is an input string with at least 1 character.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `count2` is equal to `count`.
- `j` is 0.
- `count` is greater than 1, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` for some `j` less than `count`.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
