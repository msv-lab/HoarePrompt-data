Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with length 1 <= |`s`| <= 10^6. The sum of lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1; `count` is the first index where `s[j] != x` if any such index exists before the loop completes, otherwise 0; `count2` is the number of consecutive characters equal to `x` after the first differing character if any such character exists, otherwise 0; `done` is False, indicating the loop has not completed all iterations without breaking.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop will run for `(n + 1) // 2` iterations unless `done` is set to `True` and the loop breaks early. After the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. `count` will be the index of the first character not equal to `x` if such a character exists before the midpoint of the string. `count2` will count the number of characters equal to `x` after `count` up to the midpoint of the string. `done` will be `False` if the loop did not break early; otherwise, it will be `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `done` is `False`, `count` is `0`, `count2` is `0`, and `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`. The condition `not done` is true, meaning `done` remains `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
