Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is the first character of the newly input string; `j` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `done` is False; `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is 1, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `n` is odd and `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Additionally, if `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If all characters in `s` are equal to `x`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the newly input string; `j` is 0; `count` is either greater than 0 or remains unchanged; `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` equals `x` and `count` is greater than 0; `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than `count`, or if the first character of `s` at index `j` is not equal to the last character of `s` at index `n - 1 - j`; otherwise, `done` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the newly input string; `j` is 1; `count` is 1 if `s[j] != x` and `count` was less than 1, otherwise `count` remains unchanged; `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` equals `x` and `count` is greater than 0; `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False. If `count > 0`, then if `s[j] != x` and `count2 > 0` and `count2 < count`, `done` is set to True. If `s[j] != x` and `count2 == count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True. If `s[j] != x` and `count2 == count` and `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is set to 0. If `s[j] != x` and `count2` is not equal to `count` and `count2 > count`, `done` is set to True. If `s[j] == x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count2` or `done`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the newly input string; `j` is 2. If `count > 0`, then: if `s[j] != x` and `count2 > 0` and `count2 < count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j] != x` and `count2` equals `count` or `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j] == x` and `count > 1`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `s[j] != x` and `count <= 1`, `count2` is set to 0. If `s[j] != x` and `count > 1`, `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` equals `x` and `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j] == x` and `count > 0`, `count2` is incremented by 1 again. `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False. If `count <= 0`, then none of the changes specified in the if part are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
