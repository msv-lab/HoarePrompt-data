Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `string` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the midpoint of the string (rounded up if the length is odd).
- `count` is the index of the first character not equal to `x` if such a character exists before the midpoint of the string.
- `count2` counts the number of characters equal to `x` after `count` up to the midpoint of the string.
- `done` is `False`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `x` is `s[0]`, which is the first character of the string.
- If `n` is equal to 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged as per the if part description.

### Python Code:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
