Output State: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, `count2` is 0, `count` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or their values; it simply moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since no variables are changed or affected by the `continue` statement in this context, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
