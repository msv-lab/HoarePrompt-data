Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the input string with at least 1 character; `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 0; `count` is greater than 0, indicating that `s[j]` is not equal to `x` for some `j` less than `count`, and `count` has been set to that `j`; `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is a positive integer less than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count`, `done` is True and `count2` remains equal to `count`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count2` is less than `count` and not positive, `count2` remains unchanged.**
