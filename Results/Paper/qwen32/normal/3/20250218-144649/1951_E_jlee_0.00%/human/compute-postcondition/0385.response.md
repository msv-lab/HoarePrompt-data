Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `string` is the input string.
2. `n` is at least 1.
3. `j` is 0.
4. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. `x` is `s[0]`.
6. `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the final print statement, it's mentioned here).
7. A conditional check is described, but it does not affect the print statement directly because the print statement is executed irrespective of the condition's outcome.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Explanation:
- `string[:j]` will print the substring of `string` from the beginning up to, but not including, the index `j`.
- `string[j:]` will print the substring of `string` from the index `j` to the end of the string.

Given that `j` is 0:
- `string[:0]` will be an empty string `''` because there are no characters before index 0.
- `string[0:]` will be the entire `string` because it starts from index 0 and goes to the end.

### Output:
Output: **'' [string]** (where `[string]` is the input string)
