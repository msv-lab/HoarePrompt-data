You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: `t` is the number of test cases; `s` is the list of characters from the last test case's string; `n` is the length of the last test case's string; `x` is the first character of the last test case's string; `done` is `False` if the loop did not break early in the last test case, otherwise `True`; `count` and `count2` are the final values after processing the last test case's string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines whether it is possible to split the string into one or two non-empty parts such that the parts are distinct and prints 'YES' along with the split(s) if possible, otherwise it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine whether a string can be partitioned into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program handles multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Initial Checks**:
    - If the length of the string `n` is 1, the program immediately prints "NO" because a single-character string is always a palindrome.
    - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the program prints "YES" and outputs the string itself as a single non-palindromic substring.
    - If all characters in the string are the same, the program prints "NO" because any substring of such a string will also be a palindrome.
    - If all characters except one are the same, the program checks if the middle character (in case of odd length) is different. If it is, it prints "NO" as the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Otherwise, it prints "YES" and outputs the string itself.

2. **General Case**:
    - The program then iterates through the first half of the string to check for palindromic properties.
    - If it finds any pair of characters that are not equal (i.e., the string is not a palindrome), it immediately prints "YES" and outputs the string itself.
    - If all characters in the first half match their corresponding characters in the second half (indicating a potential palindrome), the program attempts to find a valid partition:
        - It keeps track of the first position where a character is different from the first character (`count`).
        - It also keeps track of the number of consecutive characters that are the same as the first character (`count2`).
        - If it finds a valid partition (where `count2` is less than `count` or `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1), it prints "YES" and outputs the partitioned substrings.
    - If no valid partition is found after the loop, the program prints "NO".

### Analysis:

The logic in the program seems to cover most edge cases:
- It correctly handles single-character strings.
- It correctly handles strings where all characters are the same.
- It correctly handles strings where all characters except one are the same.
- It correctly identifies non-palindromic strings and outputs them as a single substring.
- It attempts to find valid partitions for more complex strings.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The program does not always correctly identify valid partitions, especially for strings with more complex patterns.
- The conditions for partitioning are not robust enough to cover all possible cases, particularly for strings that require more than two substrings to be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.

### Counterexample:

Consider the string "abacaba". The program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not find a valid partition in the first loop iteration. However, a valid partition could be "ab", "aca", "ba".

### Conclusion:

The program is not entirely correct for all possible input cases.

Correctness: **False**
