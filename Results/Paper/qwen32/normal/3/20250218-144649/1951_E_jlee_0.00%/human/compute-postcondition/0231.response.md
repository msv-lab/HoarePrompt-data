Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. `string` is the newly input string.
3. `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string.
4. `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1.
5. `x` is the first character of the newly input string.
6. `j` is initialized to 1.
7. `count` is set to 1 if `s[j] != x` and `count` was less than 1, otherwise `count` remains unchanged.
   - Since `count` is initially not defined, we can infer that `count` is set to 1 if `s[1] != x`.
8. `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` equals `x` and `count` is greater than 0.
9. `done` is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Analysis:
- `string[:j]` will print the substring of `string` from the beginning up to, but not including, the index `j`.
- `string[j:]` will print the substring of `string` from the index `j` to the end of the string.

Given that `j` is initialized to 1:
- `string[:1]` will print the first character of `string`.
- `string[1:]` will print the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Output:
The print statement will output the first character of the string and the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **string[0], string[1:] (where string[0] is the first character of the string and string[1:] is the rest of the string starting from the second character)**

To make it more precise, we can use the defined variables `x` and `string`:

Output: **x, string[1:] (where x is the first character of the string and string[1:] is the rest of the string starting from the second character)**
