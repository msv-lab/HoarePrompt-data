Output State: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `done` is True, the state of `count`, `count2` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values except for the fact that we have exited the loop or if statement.
