Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count` or `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `count` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2` and `done` is set to `True`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, the state of `count` and `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the state of `count`, `count2`, and `done` remains unchanged.**
