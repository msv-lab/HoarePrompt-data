The code snippet sets the variable `done` to `True`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `string` is the input string with at least 1 character, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is 2, `done` is True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 2. Otherwise, `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged.**
