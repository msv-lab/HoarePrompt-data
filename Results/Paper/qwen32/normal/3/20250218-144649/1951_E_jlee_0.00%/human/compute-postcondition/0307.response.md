To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the conditions described:

1. **`string`**: This is the input string.
2. **`n`**: This is the length of the `string`.
3. **`j`**: This is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the midpoint of the string (rounded up if `n` is odd).
4. **`x`**: This is the first character of the `string` (`s[0]`).
5. **`count`**: This is the index of the first character not equal to `x` if such a character exists before the midpoint of the string.
6. **`count2`**: This counts the number of characters equal to `x` after `count` up to the midpoint of the string.
7. **`done`**: This is a boolean variable initialized as `False`.
8. **`i`**: This is incremented by 1, but it is not explicitly used in the provided code snippet.
9. **`s`**: This is a list of characters from the `string`.

The conditions provided are:
- If `n` is equal to 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
- If `x` (the first character) is not equal to the last character of the `string`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

The `print('YES')` statement is outside of any conditional blocks, so it will execute regardless of the conditions above.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Calculation**:
   - `string` is given, and `n` is calculated as its length.
   - `x` is the first character of `string`.
   - `j` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the midpoint of the string.
   
2. **Conditions**:
   - If `n` is 1, the state remains unchanged.
   - If the first character `x` is not equal to the last character of the `string`, the state remains unchanged.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement is executed unconditionally, regardless of the conditions mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will always print "YES" because it is not dependent on any of the conditions provided in the initial state. The conditions only affect the state of the variables and do not influence the execution of the print statement.

Output: **YES**
