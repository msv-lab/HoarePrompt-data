The code snippet `done = True` sets the variable `done` to `True`. The other variables (`string`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `x`, `i`, `count`, `count2`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `count` is less than 1, `count2` is unchanged, `done` is True**.
