Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, and `count2` remains unchanged. If `count2` equals `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged and `done` remains unchanged, with `count2` set to 0. If `count2` does not equal `count`, then if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.**
