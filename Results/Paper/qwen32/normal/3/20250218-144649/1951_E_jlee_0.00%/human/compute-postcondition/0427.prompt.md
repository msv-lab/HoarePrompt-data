Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `string` is the input string, `n` is the length of `string`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `s` is a list of characters from `string`. `x` is `s[0]`. If `s.count(x) == n`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is equal to 1 or `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, or if `n` is odd and the character at the midpoint of the string is not equal to `x`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count` or `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `count` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2` and `done` is set to `True`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, the state of `count` and `done` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` does not equal `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `count`, `count2`, and `done` remains unchanged. If `count` is not greater than 0, the state of `count`, `count2`, and `done` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, and `count2` remains unchanged unless `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, in which case `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is greater than 0, then `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, or if `count2` is not equal to `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is not greater than 1, `count` remains unchanged and `done` remains unchanged, with `count2` set to 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
