Output State: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
