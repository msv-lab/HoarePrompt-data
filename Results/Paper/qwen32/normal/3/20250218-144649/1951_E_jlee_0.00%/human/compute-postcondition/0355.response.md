Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` equals `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, `count` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, `count2` is equal to `count`, and `done` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `count` is 1, `count2` is 0, and `done` is not set to `True`. If `count2` does not equal `count`, then `count` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `done` is `True`, and if `count2` is greater than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `count2` remains as per the previous conditions, and `count2` is either 0 or not less than `count`.**
