Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines whether it is possible to split the string into one or two non-empty parts such that the parts are distinct and prints 'YES' along with the split(s) if possible, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
