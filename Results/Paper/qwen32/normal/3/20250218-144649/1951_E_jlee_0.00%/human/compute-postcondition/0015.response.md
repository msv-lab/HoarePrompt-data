The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since no variables are modified or any other operations are performed, the state of all variables remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`; if `n` equals 1, `done` remains False. Otherwise, the state of `done` is unchanged; `x` is the first character of `string` and `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`.**
