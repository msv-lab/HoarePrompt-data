To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **string**: This is the input string.
2. **n**: This is at least 1.
3. **j**: This is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
4. **count2**: This is set to the value of `count`.
5. **i**: This is incremented by 1, but its value is not directly used in the `print` statement.
6. **s**: This is a list of characters from the `string`.
7. **x**: This is the first character of the `string` (`s[0]`).
8. **count**: This is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.
9. **done**: This is set to `True`.
10. **count > 1**: This condition is given, but it doesn't directly impact the `print` statement.
11. **s[j] is not equal to x**: This means the character at index `j` in the list `s` is different from the first character `x`.

### Analysis:
- `string[:j - 1]`: This will print the substring from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`.
- `string[j - 1:]`: This will print the substring from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

Since `j` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, it represents the middle index of the string (or the first of the two middle indices if the string length is even).

### Example:
Let's assume `string = "abcdef"`, so `n = 6`.
- `j = (6 + 1) // 2 = 3`
- `s = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']`
- `x = 'a'`
- `s[j] = s[3] = 'd'` (which is not equal to `x`)

Then:
- `string[:j - 1] = string[:2] = "ab"`
- `string[j - 1:] = string[2:] = "cdef"`

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the substring from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`, followed by the substring from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

Output: **string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:] (where j is (n + 1) // 2, n is the length of the string, and s[j] is not equal to the first character of the string)**

Given the example, the output would be:
Output: **ab cdef**
