Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count2` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`. `count` is greater than 0. The state of `count` and `done` remains as per the previous conditions. Additionally, `s[j]` is equal to `x`.**
