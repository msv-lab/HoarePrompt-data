Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `string` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of the string `string` (and it is at least 1).
- `j` is initialized to 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `string` (i.e., `s[0]`).
- `count2` remains unchanged (not used in the given code snippet).
- `count` is initialized to some value, but its value is not changed in the provided snippet.
- `done` is a boolean flag that can be set to `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

- `string[:j]` will give us the substring from the start of `string` up to, but not including, the character at index `j`.
- `string[j:]` will give us the substring from the character at index `j` to the end of `string`.

### Given `j` is 1:
- `string[:j]` will be the substring from the start of `string` up to, but not including, the character at index 1. This means it will be the first character of `string`.
- `string[j:]` will be the substring from the character at index 1 to the end of `string`.

### Example:
Let's assume `string` is "hello". Given `j` is 1:
- `string[:j]` will be `"h"`.
- `string[j:]` will be `"ello"`.

### General Case:
For any string `string` of length `n` with `j` initialized to 1:
- `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
- `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **string[0], string[1:] (where string[0] is the first character of the string and string[1:] is the rest of the string starting from the second character)**
