Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `string` is the input string.
3. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
4. `n` is the length of `s`.
5. If `n` equals 1, `done` remains `False`. Otherwise, the state of `done` is unchanged.
6. `x` is the first character of `string` and `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state. 
- It simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
