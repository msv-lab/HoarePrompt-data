Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` does not equal `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `count`, `count2`, and `done` remains unchanged. If `count` is not greater than 0, the state of `count`, `count2`, and `done` remains unchanged.**
