Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; `s.count(x) == n - 1`; not all characters in `s` are equal to `x`; `done` remains unchanged; `n` is odd and `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`.**
