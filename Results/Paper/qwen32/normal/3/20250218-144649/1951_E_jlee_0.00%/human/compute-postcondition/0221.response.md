To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided. Let's break down the information given:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `string` is the newly input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of the newly input string.
- `j` is initialized to 1.
- `count` is either greater than 0 or remains unchanged.
- `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` equals `x` and `count` is greater than 0.
- `done` is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than `count`, or if the first character of `s` at index `j` is not equal to the last character of `s` at index `n - 1 - j`; otherwise, `done` remains False.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement itself that would change its output based on the initial state or the other variables defined.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, and `done`, the output of the `print` statement will always be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
