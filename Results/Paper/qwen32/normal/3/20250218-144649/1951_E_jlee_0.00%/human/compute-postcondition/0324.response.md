Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. The state of the variables remains unchanged except that `done` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
