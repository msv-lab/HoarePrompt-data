Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `string` is the input string with at least 1 character.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `j` is set to 2.
- The condition `if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1` is checked. If true, `count` is set to 2. Otherwise, `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Analysis:
- `j` is set to 2.
- `string[:j - 1]` translates to `string[:1]`, which is the substring of `string` from the start up to (but not including) the second character. This means it will be the first character of `string`.
- `string[j - 1:]` translates to `string[1:]`, which is the substring of `string` starting from the second character to the end of the string.

### Example:
Let's take an example string to illustrate:
- Suppose `string = "hello"`.
- `s = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']`.
- `x = 'h'`.
- `j = 2`.
- `string[:j - 1]` = `string[:1]` = `"h"`.
- `string[j - 1:]` = `string[1:]` = `"ello"`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the first character of the string and the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **h ello (where 'h' is the first character of the string and 'ello' is the rest of the string starting from the second character)**
