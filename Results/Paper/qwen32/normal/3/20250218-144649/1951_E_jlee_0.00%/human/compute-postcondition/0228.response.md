Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the newly input string; `j` is 1; `count` is 1 if `s[j] != x` and `count` was less than 1, otherwise `count` remains unchanged; `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` equals `x` and `count` is greater than 0; `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False.**
