Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `string` is the input string.
3. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
4. `n` is the length of `s` (i.e., `n = len(s)`).
5. `n` is greater than 1.
6. `x` is the first character of `string` (i.e., `x = string[0]`).
7. `s.count(x) == n - 1` (i.e., the character `x` appears `n - 1` times in the list `s`).
8. Not all characters in `s` are equal to `x`.
9. `done` remains unchanged (though `done` is not used in the provided code snippet).
10. Either `n` is even, or `n` is odd and the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` of `s` is equal to `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the integer `1`. The value to be printed is explicitly specified as `1` and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
