To determine the output of the given print statement `print(s - 1, s)`, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and identify the values of `s` and `s - 1`.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. **`N`**: An integer read from the input.
3. **`i`**: Set to the value of `N`.
4. **`num`**: Set to `-1`.
5. **`arr`**: A list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. The format of each tuple is `(start_index, length, value)`.
6. **`LA`**: Set to `len(arr) - 1`.
7. **`l` and `r`**: Integers read from the input as a tuple.
8. **`eli`**: The index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
9. **`s` and `e`**: `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. 
   - `s` represents the start index of the segment.
   - `e` represents the length of the segment.
10. **Conditional State**: If `tc` is greater than 5 and `ppp` is equal to 23, the state remains as described. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### Key Variables for Output:

- **`s`**: The start index of the segment at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- **`s - 1`**: The value of `s` minus 1.

### Analysis:

The value of `s` is determined by the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. Since `arr` contains tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers, `s` will be the starting index of one of these segments.

The output of the print statement `print(s - 1, s)` will be:
- `s - 1`: The value of `s` minus 1.
- `s`: The start index of the segment at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `eli`, and `LA` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `s` and `s - 1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output in terms of `s`.

### Final Output:

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the start index of the segment at the index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
