The provided code snippet assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. No changes are made to `t`, `N`, `i`, or `arr` in this code snippet.

Given the initial state, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `N` remains an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0. The variable `i` remains 0, and `arr` remains unchanged unless the condition `nums[i]` is not equal to `num` is met, but this condition is not evaluated in the given code snippet.

The only change is that `num` is now assigned the value of `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0; `i` is 0; `num` is `nums[i]`; `arr` is unchanged.**
