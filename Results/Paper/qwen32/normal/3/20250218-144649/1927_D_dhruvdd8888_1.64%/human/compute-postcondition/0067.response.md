The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1, -1`. The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables directly. It simply prints the two integers `-1` and `-1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown to confirm this:

1. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `N`, `i`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, and `e`, but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`, which means it will always output the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any external input or variable values described in the initial state.

Output: **-1, -1**
