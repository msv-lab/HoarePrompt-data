Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `i` is `N`; `num` is `-1`; `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are new integers read from the input as a tuple; `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`; `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The input value for the loop is decremented by 1 to ensure one more iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the exception that the loop counter `t` is decremented by 1, ensuring one more iteration of the loop will occur.
