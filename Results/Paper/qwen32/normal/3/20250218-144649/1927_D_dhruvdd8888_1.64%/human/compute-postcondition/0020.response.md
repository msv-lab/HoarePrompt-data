The code appends a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `num` is `nums[i]`. The variable `s` is 1, so `1 + s` equals 2. Therefore, the tuple `(2, 2, num)` is appended to `arr`.

The values of `t` and `N` are not affected by this operation. The variable `i` remains 2, and `num` remains `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `num` is `nums[i]`, `arr` has a new element `(2, 2, nums[i])` appended to it, and `s` is 1.**
