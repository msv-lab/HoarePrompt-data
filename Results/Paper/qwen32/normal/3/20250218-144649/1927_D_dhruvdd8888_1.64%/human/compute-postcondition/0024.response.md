The given loop iterates through the `nums` list and identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers, appending a tuple to `arr` each time a new number is encountered. The tuple contains the start index of the segment, the end index of the segment, and the number itself. The loop runs `N + 1` times, where `N` is the length of the `nums` list minus one (since `nums` has an additional `-1` appended to it).

Let's break down the loop's behavior and determine the final output state:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` (start index) is initialized to 0.
   - `e` (end index) is initialized to 0.
   - `num` is initialized to `nums[0]`.
   - `arr` is initialized to an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = N`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `nums[i]` is different from `num`.
     - If they are different, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr` and updates `s` to `i`.
     - Regardless, it updates `num` to `nums[i]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `arr` will contain tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `i` will be `N`, as the loop runs `N + 1` times.
   - `num` will be the last element in `nums` (which is `-1`).
   - `s` will be the start index of the last segment.

Given the constraints and the loop's behavior, the final output state will be:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `N` remains unchanged as it is the input length minus one.
- `i` will be `N` after the loop completes.
- `num` will be `-1`, the last element in `nums`.
- `arr` will contain tuples representing all segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `i` is `N`; `num` is `-1`; `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.**

In natural language, after the loop completes, the variable `i` will be equal to `N`, `num` will hold the value `-1` (the last element of `nums`), and `arr` will contain tuples representing the start index, end index, and value of each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged from their initial states.
