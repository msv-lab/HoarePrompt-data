The code snippet assigns the value of `len(arr) - 1` to the variable `LA`. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `i`, `num`, and `arr`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `i` is `N`; `num` is `-1`; `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
