Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the logic for finding two different elements within the specified range of each query is flawed. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `bisect_left`**: The program uses `bisect_left` to find the range in `arr`, but it does not correctly handle the case where the range `[l, r]` spans multiple segments in `arr`. It only checks the first segment that starts at or after `l`, which may not contain a pair of different elements.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the range `[l, r]` is entirely within a single segment in `arr` or where `l` and `r` span multiple segments correctly.

3. **Output for Specific Test Case**: The program has a conditional statement that skips processing for a specific test case (`ppp == 23`), which is not a valid approach for solving the problem in general.

4. **Logic for Finding Pairs**: The logic for finding pairs of different elements within the specified range is not robust enough. It should check for the presence of at least two different elements within the range `[l, r]` and return the indices of any such pair.

To fix these issues, the program should iterate over the elements in the range `[l, r]` and check for the presence of at least two different elements. If found, it should return their indices; otherwise, it should return `-1 -1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def main():
    tc = int(stdin.readline())
    for _ in range(tc):
        N = int(stdin.readline())
        nums = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
        q = int(stdin.readline())
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
            l -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            r -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            found = False
            for i in range(l, r):
                if nums[i] != nums[i + 1]:
                    print(i + 1, i + 2)  # Convert back to 1-based index
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                print(-1, -1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version iterates over each query's range and checks for the first pair of different elements, printing their indices if found, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.
