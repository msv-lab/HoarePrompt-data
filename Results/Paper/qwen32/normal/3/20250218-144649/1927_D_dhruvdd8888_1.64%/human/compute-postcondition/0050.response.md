To determine the output of the `print(s, e + 1)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables `s` and `e`.

### Breakdown of the Initial State:
1. **t**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. **N**: An integer read from the input.
3. **i**: Set to `N`.
4. **num**: Set to `-1`.
5. **arr**: A list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
6. **LA**: Set to `len(arr) - 1`.
7. **l, r**: Integers read from the input as a tuple.
8. **eli**: The index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
9. **s, e**: The first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Additionally, `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and `e` is less than `r` and `e` is less than `N`.

### Key Points:
- `s` and `e` are derived from a tuple in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
- `s` is the starting index of a segment in `nums`, and `e` is the ending index of that segment.
- `e + 1` will be the index immediately after the segment ends.

### Output Analysis:
Given the constraints and the way `s` and `e` are defined, the output will be the starting index `s` of the segment and the index immediately after the segment ends (`e + 1`).

### Conclusion:
The `print(s, e + 1)` statement will print the starting index `s` of the segment and the index immediately after the segment ends (`e + 1`).

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s and e are derived from the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in the list arr, representing the start and end indices of a segment in nums)**
