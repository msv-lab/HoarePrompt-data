Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `i` is `N`; `num` is `-1`; `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input as a tuple; `tc` is greater than 5. If `ppp` is equal to 23, the condition is met as described. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.**
