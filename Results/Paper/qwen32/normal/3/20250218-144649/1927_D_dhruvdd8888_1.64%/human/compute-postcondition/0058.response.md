Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print(l, r)` statement. Let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state to understand the values of `l` and `r`.

1. **Variables and Initializations**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `N` is an integer read from the input.
   - `i` is set to `N`.
   - `num` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are new integers read from the input as a tuple.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
   - `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - The subsequent conditions and operations depend on the values of `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `tc`, and `ppp`.

2. **Relevant to the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement directly prints the values of `l` and `r`.
   - `l` and `r` are explicitly described as new integers read from the input as a tuple.

Given the above, the values of `l` and `r` are the integers that were read from the input as a tuple. Since these values are not further modified or derived from other variables in the provided text, the print statement will output exactly those values.

Therefore, the output of the `print(l, r)` statement will be the values of `l` and `r` as they were read from the input.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are the integers read from the input as a tuple)**
