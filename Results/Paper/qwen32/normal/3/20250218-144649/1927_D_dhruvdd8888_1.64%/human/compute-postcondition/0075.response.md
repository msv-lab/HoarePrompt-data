To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement.

Here's the relevant information from the initial state:
- `l` and `r` are integers read from the input as a tuple.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(l, r)
```

Given that `l` and `r` are integers read from the input as a tuple, the `print` statement will output the values of `l` and `r` directly. Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe them as the values read from the input.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are integers read from the input as a tuple)**
