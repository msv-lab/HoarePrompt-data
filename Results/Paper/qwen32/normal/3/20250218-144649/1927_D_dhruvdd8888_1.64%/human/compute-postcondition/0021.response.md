The code snippet `s = i` assigns the value of `i` to `s`. Given that `i` is 2, `s` will now hold the value 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `num` is `nums[i]`, `arr` has a new element `(2, 2, nums[i])` appended to it, and `s` is 2.**
