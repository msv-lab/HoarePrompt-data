Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `num` is `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` has a new element `(2, 2, nums[i])` appended to it, and `s` is 2. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged and `s` is 1.**
