The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print(-1, -1)`. This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1`, regardless of the values of any other variables in the program.

The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but these do not affect the values being printed by this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `-1, -1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **-1, -1**
