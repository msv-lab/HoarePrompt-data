You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find two different indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a subarray defined by \(l\) and \(r\) such that \(a_i \neq a_j\). If such a pair does not exist, the program should output \(-1 -1\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array, the array itself, the number of queries, and then the queries.

2. **Array Segmentation:**
   - The program segments the array into contiguous segments of identical elements. This is done with the help of a loop that iterates through the array and records the start and end indices of each segment along with the element value.
   - The segments are stored in the list `arr`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or after the left boundary of the query.
   - Depending on the position of the found segment, the program attempts to find two different indices within the query range that correspond to different values.

4. **Output:**
   - If a valid pair of indices is found, they are printed.
   - If no such pair is found, \(-1 -1\) is printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Segments:**
  - The program does not correctly handle all cases where a valid pair of indices should be found.
  - The logic for checking segments and finding valid indices is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly check if there is a segment that ends before the right boundary of the query or if there is a segment that starts after the left boundary.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the subarray consists of only one unique element correctly.
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray has exactly two different elements.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
