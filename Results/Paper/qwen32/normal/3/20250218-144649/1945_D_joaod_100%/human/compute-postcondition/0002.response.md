The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The initial state does not specify the values of `na_frente` and `pos_final`, but after the execution of the code, these variables will hold the values read from the input.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9, the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input, `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input.**
