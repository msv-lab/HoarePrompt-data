The code snippet `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` directly adds the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to the `total`. This means that the value of `total` is updated by adding the element at index `v` from the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`.

Given the initial state, the values of `cases`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `v` remain unchanged except for `total`, which is updated.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9, the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its previous value.**
