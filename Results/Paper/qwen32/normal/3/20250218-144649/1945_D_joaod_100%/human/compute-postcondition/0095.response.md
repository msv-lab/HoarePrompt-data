The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c` and the variable `cases`. If `c` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is incremented by 6, so `c` is now 6 more than its value at the start of the last iteration.

Given that `c` is incremented by 6 in each iteration, we need to adjust `c` to be 6 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. The other variables (`v`, `total`, `best`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`v` is -1, `total` is 120, `best` is 50, `c` is 9, `na_frente` is 5, `pos_final` is 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `custo_pra_passar_b` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]**
