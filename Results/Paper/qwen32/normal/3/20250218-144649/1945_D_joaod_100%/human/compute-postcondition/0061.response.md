Postcondition: **`v` is -1, `total` is 0, `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
