Output State: **`v` is -1, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Natural Language: The `total` has been updated to be the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
