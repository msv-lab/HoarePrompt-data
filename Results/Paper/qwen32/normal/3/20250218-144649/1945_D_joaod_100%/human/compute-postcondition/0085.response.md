Postcondition: **`v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is updated based on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. `c` is incremented by 1. `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input.**
