Postcondition: **`v` is `na_frente`, `total` is updated based on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is smaller than the current `best`; otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` remains `sys.float_info.max`. `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input.**
