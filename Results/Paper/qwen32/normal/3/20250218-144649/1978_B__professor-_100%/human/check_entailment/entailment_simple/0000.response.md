### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the maximum profit Bob can make by selling n buns, where the first k buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from b, and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price a.

Let's analyze the given program's logic:

1. **Condition when `b <= a`:**
   - If the price of the first bun `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it's better not to use the promotional price since it won't yield more profit. Hence, Bob sells all buns at the usual price `a`. The total profit is `n * a`.

2. **Condition when `b - a >= n`:**
   - If the difference between the promotional price of the first bun `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it means the promotional prices for all buns will be higher than the usual price `a`. Thus, Bob should sell all buns at the promotional prices. The total profit is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent bun. The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and ending at `b - n + 1` is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

3. **Otherwise:**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, Bob should sell as many buns as possible at the promotional prices until the promotional price becomes less than or equal to the usual price `a`. The number of buns sold at promotional prices is `b - a`. The total profit from these buns is the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` to `a + 1`, which is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`. The remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `a * n` to the profit. However, since `n` buns are sold in total, and `b - a` buns are sold at promotional prices, the remaining buns are `n - (b - a)`, contributing `a * (n - (b - a))` to the profit. Combining these, the total profit is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * (n - (b - a))`, which simplifies to `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.

The given program correctly implements these conditions and calculates the maximum profit for each test case.

### Correctness: **True**
