Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 as read from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.**
