To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the expression step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

The initial state tells us that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers from 1 to \(10^9\) and `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. However, `a` and `t` are not used in the given print statement, so we can ignore them for this particular task.

The print statement is:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

Let's analyze the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. **Calculate \(2 * b\):** This is simply twice the value of `b`.
2. **Subtract \(n\) from \(2 * b\):** This gives us \(2 * b - n\).
3. **Add 1 to the result:** This gives us \(2 * b - n + 1\).
4. **Multiply the result by \(n\):** This gives us \((2 * b - n + 1) * n\).
5. **Perform integer division by 2:** This gives us \((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2\).

The final result of the expression is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function, although since the result of the division is already an integer (due to the use of `//` which is integer division), this conversion is redundant but does not change the result.

Thus, the expression \((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2\) calculates the final value to be printed.

Output: **(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 (where b and n are integers from 1 to \(10^9\))**
