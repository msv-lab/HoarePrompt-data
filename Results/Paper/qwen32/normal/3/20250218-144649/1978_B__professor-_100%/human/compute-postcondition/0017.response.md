Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 as read from the input. `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `b - a >= n`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged.**
