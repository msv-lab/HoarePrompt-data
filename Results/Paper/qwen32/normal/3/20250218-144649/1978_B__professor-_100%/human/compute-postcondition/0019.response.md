The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop simply runs `t` times, and the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` do not change during the loop iterations. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the state remains the same with respect to the loop head variable.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 as read from the input. `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `b <= a`, no change is made to `n`, `a`, `b`, or `t`. Otherwise, if `b - a >= n`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged in all cases.**
