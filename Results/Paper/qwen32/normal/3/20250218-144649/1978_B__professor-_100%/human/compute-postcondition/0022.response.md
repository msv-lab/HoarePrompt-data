To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the formula and the conditions provided in the initial state.

The formula to be evaluated is:
```
int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)
```

Let's break down the components of the formula:
1. `2 * b`: This is simply twice the value of `b`.
2. `2 * b - n + 1`: This expression subtracts `n` from `2 * b` and then adds 1.
3. `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`: This multiplies the result of the previous expression by `n`.
4. `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`: This performs integer division of the result by 2.

The conditions provided state:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers from 1 to \(10^9\).
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- If `b <= a`, no change is made to `n`, `a`, `b`, or `t`.
- If `b - a >= n`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged in all cases.

The print statement does not depend on the conditions directly but rather on the values of `n` and `b`. Therefore, we will evaluate the formula based on the given formula and the range of values for `n` and `b`.

Let's denote the expression inside the print statement as `result`:
```
result = int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)
```

Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `result`. However, we can describe the formula precisely based on the given information.

Output: **result (where result is the integer value of (2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)**
