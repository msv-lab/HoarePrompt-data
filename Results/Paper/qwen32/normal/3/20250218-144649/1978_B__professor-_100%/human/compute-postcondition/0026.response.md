To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, and then computes the cost based on the given conditions.

Here's a summary of the logic inside the loop:
- If `b <= a`, the cost is `n * a`.
- If `b - a >= n`, the cost is `((2 * b - n + 1) * n) // 2`.
- Otherwise, the cost is `((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2) + a * n`.

The loop processes each test case independently and prints the result for each one. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are re-assigned for each iteration based on the input, but `t` remains constant throughout the loop.

After all iterations are completed, the loop terminates, and the only variables that have been modified are those used within the loop body (`n`, `a`, `b`), which are local to each iteration and do not persist after the loop ends. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it only controls the number of iterations.

Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is that the loop has processed all `t` test cases and has printed the corresponding costs for each test case. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` do not retain any specific values after the loop ends, as they are overwritten in each iteration.

Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` test cases and printed the corresponding costs for each test case. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` do not retain any specific values after the loop ends.**
