To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to break down the expression and understand the role of each variable.

Given:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers from 1 to \(10^9\).
- `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

Let's break down the expression:

1. **`(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`**:
   - This part calculates the sum of the first `(b - a + 1)` natural numbers starting from `(b - a)`.
   - It is equivalent to the sum of an arithmetic series from `a` to `b`, which is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - The `// 2` ensures integer division.

2. **`a * n`**:
   - This part multiplies the integer `a` by `n`.

3. **`int(...)`**:
   - The `int()` function is used to ensure the result is an integer, but since all operations involved are integer operations, this is redundant in this context.

Combining these, the expression calculates:
\[
\text{Output} = \frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n
\]

This expression represents:
- The sum of integers from `a` to `b`, plus
- `a` multiplied by `n`.

Thus, the final output is a specific integer value that depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `n`.

Output: **\(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n\) (where \(a\), \(b\), and \(n\) are the given integers)**
