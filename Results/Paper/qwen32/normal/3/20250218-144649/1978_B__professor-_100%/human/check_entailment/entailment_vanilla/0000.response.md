To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and ensure it correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
    - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Maximum Profit:**
    - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
        - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because selling them at `b` would yield less profit.
        - The formula `n * a` correctly computes the total profit in this case.
    - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
        - If the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`, it's optimal to sell all buns using the modified price scheme.
        - The modified price for the first bun is `b`, the second is `b-1`, and so on, until the `n`-th bun, which is sold for `b - (n-1)`.
        - The sum of an arithmetic series can be used to compute the total profit: `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
    - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
        - If the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, it's optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
        - The sum of the modified prices for the first `b - a` buns is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`.
        - The remaining `n - (b - a)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `a * (n - (b - a))` to the total profit.
        - The formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` correctly computes the total profit in this case.

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - The program handles the edge cases where `b <= a` and `b - a >= n` correctly.
    - The program also handles the case where `b - a < n` correctly by splitting the buns into two groups and computing the profit for each group.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the maximum profit for all possible scenarios described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
