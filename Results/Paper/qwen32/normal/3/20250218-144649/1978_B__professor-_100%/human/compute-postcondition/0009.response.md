To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression step by step using the provided initial state:

The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```python
int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)
```
We need to understand the values and the operations involved:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: An input integer that is greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not directly used in the expression).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b`: Integers from 1 to 10^9, with `b` being greater than `a` and `b - a` being less than `n`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`: This part of the expression calculates the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers. The formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k = b - a`.
   - `a * n`: This part multiplies the integer `a` by `n`.

3. **Combining the parts:**
   - The expression first computes the sum of the numbers from `a + 1` to `b` (inclusive), which is equivalent to the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers.
   - Then, it adds `a * n` to this sum.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The final result is the integer value of the sum of the numbers from `a + 1` to `b` plus `a * n`.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **the sum of the integers from `a + 1` to `b` plus `a * n`** (where `b - a` is less than `n` and `b` is greater than `a`).
