The code snippet provided only reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `b` as they are not mentioned in the code snippet. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are described as being part of each test case, but they are not initialized or modified by the given code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; `n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 and represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price for each of the `t` test cases.**
