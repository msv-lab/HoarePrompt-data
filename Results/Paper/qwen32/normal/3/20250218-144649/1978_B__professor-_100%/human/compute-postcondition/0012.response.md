The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of times the loop will execute. The loop will execute `t` times, and after each iteration, `_` is implicitly incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the conditions inside the loop body, we only need to adjust `_` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` would have been the value it was before the increment. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 as read from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`. `_` is incremented by 1**
