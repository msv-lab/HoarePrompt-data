Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 as read from the input; `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `b <= a`, no change is made to `n`, `a`, `b`, or `t`. Otherwise, if `b - a >= n`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged in all cases.**

In simpler terms: **`n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` retain their initial values. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes occur. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, it is not.**
