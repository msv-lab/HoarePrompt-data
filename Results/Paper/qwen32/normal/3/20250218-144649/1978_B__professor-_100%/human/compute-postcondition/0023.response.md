Let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers from 1 to 10^9.
- `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- If `b <= a`, no changes are made to `n`, `a`, `b`, or `t`.
- If `b - a >= n`, the condition is satisfied.
- If `b - a < n`, the condition is not satisfied.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged in all cases.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

### Analysis:
The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```python
int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)
```

Let's break down the expression:
1. **`(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`**:
   - This part of the expression calculates the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers.
   - The formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
   - Here, `k` is `(b - a)`.
   - Therefore, `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` gives the sum of numbers from `1` to `(b - a)`.

2. **`a * n`**:
   - This part of the expression simply multiplies `a` by `n`.

3. **Summing the two parts**:
   - The final expression adds the sum of numbers from `1` to `(b - a)` to `a * n`.

### Output Description:
The output of the `print` statement is the integer value of the expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)** (where `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers and `a * n` is the product of `a` and `n`)
