Postcondition: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list` and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value and `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` includes the reversed string of `x`.**
