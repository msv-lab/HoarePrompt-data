The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over `operational_list`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to reflect the next value in `operational_list`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `y` is 0
- `list_len` is the first value from the input
- `max_power` is the second value from the input
- `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 substring
- `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed
- If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of `x` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x` as a string.

To proceed to the next iteration, `x` should be updated to the next substring in `operational_list`.

Let's assume that the current value of `x` is the first substring in `operational_list`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the second substring in `operational_list`. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 substring, `x` is the second substring in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the new `x` reversed. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the new `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of the new `x` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the new `x` as a string.**

If `x` was the last substring in `operational_list` during the previous iteration, then the loop would not execute again. However, based on the problem statement, we assume there is at least one more substring to process.
