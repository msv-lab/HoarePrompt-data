Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `y` is 2, `list_len` is unchanged, `max_power` is unchanged, `operational_list` is unchanged, `rev_res` is the concatenation of all substrings from `operational_list` that maintain the same length when reversed, `rev_val` is a list of reversed strings of all substrings from `operational_list` that do not maintain the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, and `rev_val` must have at least one element. Additionally, `x` is an even integer.**
