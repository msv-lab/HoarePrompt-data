The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of substrings, which are then assigned to the variable `operational_list`. The variables `t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `rev_res`, and `rev_val` remain unchanged by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is an empty list.**

In simpler terms: The variable `operational_list` is now a list of substrings obtained from the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
