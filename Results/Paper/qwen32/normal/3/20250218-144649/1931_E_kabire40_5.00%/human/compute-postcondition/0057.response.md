The code snippet provided is `x_rev = int(x[::-1])`. However, the initial state does not include a variable `x`. To follow the instructions accurately and provide a meaningful output, I will assume that `x` is the first element of the `operational_list` as it is the only list provided and the context suggests that operations are likely to be performed on elements of this list. 

Therefore, let's assume `x` is the first element of `operational_list`.

Given this assumption:

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 substring, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`.

Now, the code reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer, assigning this value to `x_rev`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 substring, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the first element of `operational_list`.**
