Postcondition: **`x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, then `rev_res` is the sum of its previous value and `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.**
