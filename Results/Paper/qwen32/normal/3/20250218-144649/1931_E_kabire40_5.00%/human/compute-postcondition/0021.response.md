Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 2 more substrings, `x` is the third substring in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the new `x` reversed. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value and `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` includes the reversed version of `x`.**
