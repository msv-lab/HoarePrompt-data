The code snippet `rev_res = rev_res + x` concatenates the string `x` to the existing string `rev_res`. The values of `x` and `x_rev` are not altered by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`; `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value and `x`.**
