Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where `x` is equal to its reverse, plus the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is odd, for all `x` in the range of `len(rev_val)`, `rev_val` is a sorted list of all reversed strings `x_rev` from `operational_list` where the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`, and `10 ** int(max_power)` is less than the integer value of `rev_res`.**
