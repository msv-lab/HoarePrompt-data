Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 substring, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of `x` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x` as a string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 substring, `x` is the second substring in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the new `x` reversed. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the new `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of the new `x` concatenated with `x` if the condition of the if statement is true, otherwise `rev_res` is the string representation of the new `x`. In both cases, if the lengths are equal, `rev_val` is an empty list; otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the new `x` as a string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 2 more substrings, `x` is the third substring in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the new `x` reversed. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value and `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` includes the reversed version of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
