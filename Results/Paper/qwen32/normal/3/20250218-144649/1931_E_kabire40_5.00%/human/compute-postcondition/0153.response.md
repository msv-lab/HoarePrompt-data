Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it performs operations on the list `a` involving reversing integers and sorting. Based on the results of these operations and the value of `m`, it prints either "Sasha" or "Anna".**
