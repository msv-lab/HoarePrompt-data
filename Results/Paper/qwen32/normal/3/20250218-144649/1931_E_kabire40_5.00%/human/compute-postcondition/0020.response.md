The code snippet appends the reversed version of `x` to the list `rev_val`. The initial state specifies that `x` is the third substring in `operational_list`, and `x_rev` is the integer value of the new `x` reversed. However, the code provided only appends the reversed string version of `x` to `rev_val` and does not update `x_rev`. Therefore, `x_rev` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 2 more substrings, `x` is the third substring in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the new `x` reversed, `rev_val` includes the reversed version of `x`.**
