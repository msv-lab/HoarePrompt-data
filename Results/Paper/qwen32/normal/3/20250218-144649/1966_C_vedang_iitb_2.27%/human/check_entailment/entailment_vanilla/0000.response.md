Let's analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, specifically a variant where players can remove a positive number of stones from each non-empty pile in a single turn, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The optimal play in such games often involves the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes. However, the provided program seems to use a different approach.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1(a)`

- **Purpose**: This function appears to transform the list of pile sizes into a list of differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
- **Implementation**:
  - `a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))` : This creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes.
  - `a_temp = a_new.copy()` : A copy of the sorted unique pile sizes is made.
  - The loop `for i in range(1, len(a_new))` modifies `a_new` such that each element (except the first) is the difference between the current element and the previous one in the sorted unique list.
- **Output**: A list where each element (except the first) is the difference between consecutive unique pile sizes.

#### Function `func_2(a, n)`

- **Purpose**: This function determines the winner of the game for a given set of piles.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Base Cases**:
    - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins.
    - If there are two piles (`n == 2`):
      - If the first pile size is even, Alice wins.
      - If the first pile size is odd, Bob wins.
  - **Recursive Case**:
    - `winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` : Recursively determine the winner for the game excluding the first pile.
    - The function then decides the winner based on the outcome of the recursive call and the size of the first pile.
- **Output**: Returns `1` if Alice wins and `2` if Bob wins.

### Evaluation

The program's logic does not align with the optimal strategy for the game, which involves the Nim-sum. The base cases and recursive logic in `func_2` do not correctly determine the winner for all possible configurations of piles.

For example:
- In the third test case, the piles are `[1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]`. The correct strategy involves calculating the Nim-sum of these numbers, which is `1 ^ 3 ^ 9 ^ 7 ^ 4 ^ 2 ^ 100 = 128`. Since the Nim-sum is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. However, the provided program does not use this approach and may incorrectly determine the winner.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.

Correctness: **False**
