Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile starting from the second pile, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n - 1 < len(a) + 1, `n` is not equal to 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, `winNext` holds the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`, and `winNext` is either 2 or (1 and the first element of `a` is not 1).**
