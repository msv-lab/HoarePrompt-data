### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can add or remove 1 cube in each move.
- Given `n` moves and `m` cubes, determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The answer should be "Yes" or "No" (case-insensitive).

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of moves) and `m` (number of cubes). It then checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Logic Check:
- **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`:** This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even. Since each move either adds or removes one cube, the net effect of all moves (additions and subtractions) must be an even number to end up with exactly `m` cubes.
- **Condition `n - m >= 0`:** This ensures that the number of moves is at least the number of cubes. If `n < m`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes since you can't remove more cubes than you have.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Case 1:** `n = 1`, `m = 0` - This should be "Yes" because you can remove 1 cube from an initially empty tower.
- **Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 1` - This should be "Yes" because you can add 1 cube in the first move and remove 1 in the second, or vice versa.
- **Case 3:** `n = 3`, `m = 3` - This should be "Yes" because you can add 1 cube in each of the 3 moves.
- **Case 4:** `n = 2`, `m = 3` - This should be "No" because you can't have 3 cubes with only 2 moves.
- **Case 5:** `n = 5`, `m = 3` - This should be "Yes" because you can add 1 cube in 3 moves and remove 1 in the other 2 moves.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm the state of the program before and after the function call. The annotations state that if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, the program prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". This aligns with the logic described in the problem.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected for the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

Final: **True**
