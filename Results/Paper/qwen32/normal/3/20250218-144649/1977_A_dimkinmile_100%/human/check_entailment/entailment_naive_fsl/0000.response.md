Let's analyze the given program based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove 1 cube in each move.
- Given `n` moves and `m` cubes, determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The answer should be "Yes" or "No" (case-insensitive).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of moves) and `m` (number of cubes). It then checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Logic Check:
- **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`:** This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, and to achieve a specific number of cubes, the net effect of all moves (additions and subtractions) must be an even number.
- **Condition `n - m >= 0`:** This ensures that the number of moves is at least the number of cubes. This is because if `n < m`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes since you can't remove more cubes than you have.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Case 1:** `n = 1`, `m = 0` - This should be "Yes" because you can remove 1 cube from an initially empty tower.
- **Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 1` - This should be "Yes" because you can add 1 cube in the first move and remove 1 in the second, or vice versa.
- **Case 3:** `n = 3`, `m = 3` - This should be "Yes" because you can add 1 cube in each of the 3 moves.
- **Case 4:** `n = 2`, `m = 3` - This should be "No" because you can't have 3 cubes with only 2 moves.
- **Case 5:** `n = 5`, `m = 3` - This should be "Yes" because you can add 1 cube in 3 moves and remove 1 in the other 2 moves.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. It checks both the parity of the difference and ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes. The program should work correctly for all edge cases and examples provided.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given conditions.
