### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.

Let's break down the logic in the provided program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `kreker` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the program reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Logic to Determine Feasibility:**
   - The core logic is in the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`.
   - Let's analyze why this condition works:
     - **`(n - m) % 2 == 0`:** This condition checks if the difference between the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` is even. The reason for this is that each move either adds or removes one cube. To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of additions must equal the number of removals plus `m`. If `n - m` is even, it means the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in `m` cubes.
     - **`n - m >= 0`:** This condition ensures that `n` is at least as large as `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because the maximum number of cubes we can have after `n` moves is `n` (if we add a cube in every move).

3. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions used in the program accurately reflect the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
