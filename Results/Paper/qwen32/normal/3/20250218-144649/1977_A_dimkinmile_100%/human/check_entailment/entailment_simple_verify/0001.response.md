Reasoning: The original assessment provides a clear and accurate explanation of the problem and the logic used in the program. It correctly identifies that for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even and non-negative. The annotations in the code align with this logic, confirming that the program checks these conditions correctly.

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, then checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". This matches the reasoning provided in the original assessment.

Let's verify the logic with the example provided in the problem description:

1. **First test case (n=3, m=3):**
   - `n - m = 3 - 3 = 0`, which is even and non-negative.
   - The program should print "Yes", and the annotations confirm this.

2. **Second test case (n=2, m=4):**
   - `n - m = 2 - 4 = -2`, which is even but negative.
   - The program should print "No", and the annotations confirm this.

3. **Third test case (n=5, m=3):**
   - `n - m = 5 - 3 = 2`, which is even and non-negative.
   - The program should print "Yes", and the annotations confirm this.

Since the program correctly handles the logic and the annotations support this, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
