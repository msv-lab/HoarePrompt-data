### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.

The key observation is that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the final number of cubes `m` must be even and non-negative. Here's why:

1. **Even Difference**: Since each move either adds or removes one cube, the net change in the number of cubes after `n` moves must be an even number. This is because you can only reach an even number of cubes by adding/removing cubes in pairs (one addition and one removal, or vice versa).

2. **Non-negative Difference**: The number of moves `n` must be at least as large as the number of cubes `m` because you cannot have more cubes than moves (since you can only add one cube per move).

The provided program follows this logic correctly. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks if `n - m` is even and non-negative. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
