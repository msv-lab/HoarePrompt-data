Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `trumps` is a list containing the elements `['6', '4', '2']`.
- `answers` is a list containing the elements `['3C 5C', '8D 7']`.
- `suits` is a dictionary with keys `'C'`, `'D'`, `'H'`, and `'S'` and values `None`, `'8'`, `None`, `None` respectively.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Analysis:
1. The `pop()` method removes and returns the last element from the list `trumps`.
2. The first `pop()` call will remove and return `'2'` from `trumps`, so `trumps` becomes `['6', '4']`.
3. The second `pop()` call will remove and return `'4'` from `trumps`, so `trumps` becomes `['6']`.
4. The variable `trump` is referenced in the print statement but is not defined in the initial state. This will result in a `NameError` because `trump` is undefined.

Given the undefined variable `trump`, the code will not execute successfully, and an error will be raised. However, based on the task requirements, we should describe the intended output if `trump` were defined.

### Intended Output if `trump` were defined:
If we assume `trump` is a defined variable, let's say `trump = 'S'` for illustration purposes, the print statement would evaluate as follows:
- `trumps.pop()` returns `'2'`, and `trumps` becomes `['6', '4']`.
- `trumps.pop()` returns `'4'`, and `trumps` becomes `['6']`.

Thus, the print statement would be:
```python
print(f'2S 4S')
```

### Final Output:
Since `trump` is not defined, the actual execution would result in an error. However, based on the task requirements and assuming `trump` were defined as `'S'`, the output would be:

Output: **2S 4S (assuming trump is 'S')**
