Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value (returns `None`). The function seems to be designed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of rounds, the trump suit, and a list of cards, but based on the provided output, it does not return any specific result for these cases.**
