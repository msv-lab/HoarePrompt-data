Postcondition: **`trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank` if `suit` equals `trump`, otherwise `trumps` is an empty list; `trump` holds the value of the second line of input (trump suit); `answers` is a list containing one or more strings ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]), with the latest string being `rank + suit` if `suits[suit]` was not `None` and `suit` does not equal `trump`. If `suits[suit]` was `None`, `answers` contains one string ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([rank, rank])]) which is `rank + suit`. `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}` except `suits[suit]` which is `None` if `suits[suit]` was not `None` and `suit` does not equal `trump`, otherwise `suits[suit]` is `rank`. `rank` is the rank part of the `card` string; `suit` is the suit part of the `card` string.**
