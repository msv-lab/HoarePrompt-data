Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` is an empty list; `trump` holds the value of the second line of input (trump suit); the third line (2n card strings) is still available for reading; `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank` if `suit` equals `trump`, otherwise `trumps` is an empty list. `trump` holds the value of the second line of input (trump suit). `answers` is a list containing one string ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]) if `suits[suit]` was not `None` and `suit` does not equal `trump`, otherwise `answers` is an empty list. `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}` except `suits[suit]` which is `rank` if `suits[suit]` was `None` and `suit` does not equal `trump`, otherwise `suits[suit]` remains `None`. `rank` is the rank part of the `card` string. `suit` is the suit part of the `card` string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank` if `suit` equals `trump`, otherwise `trumps` is an empty list. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` includes the additional value `rank`. `trump` holds the value of the second line of input (trump suit). `answers` is a list containing one string ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]) if `suits[suit]` was not `None` and `suit` does not equal `trump`, otherwise `answers` is an empty list. If `suit` does not equal `trump` and `suits[suit]` was `None`, `answers` contains one string `rank + suit`. `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}` except `suits[suit]` which is `rank` if `suits[suit]` was `None` and `suit` does not equal `trump`, otherwise `suits[suit]` remains `None` or is set to `rank` if `suit` does not equal `trump`. `rank` is the rank part of the `card` string and `suit` is the suit part of the `card` string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank` followed by `rank`. Otherwise, `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank` if `suit` equals `trump`, otherwise it is an empty list. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list containing one or more strings ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]). If `suits[suit]` is `None` and `suit` does not equal `trump`, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`, and `answers` is a list containing one string ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]). If `suit` equals `trump`, `answers` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
