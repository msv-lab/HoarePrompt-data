The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), representing the number of rounds. The second line contains a single character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'). The third line contains 2n distinct two-character strings, each representing a card in the format <rank><suit>, where rank is one of '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' and suit is one of 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'.
