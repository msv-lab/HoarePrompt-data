The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables; it simply moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given that the `continue` statement is used without any context of a loop in the provided code snippet, it would typically have no effect in a standalone script. However, if it is part of a loop, it would not change the values of the variables `trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, `suit`, or `rank`.

Since no variables are affected by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`trumps` is `['2', '4', '6', '7']`, `answers` is `['3C 5C']`, `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': '8', 'H': None, 'S': None}`, `suit` is `'C'`, `rank` is `None`.**
