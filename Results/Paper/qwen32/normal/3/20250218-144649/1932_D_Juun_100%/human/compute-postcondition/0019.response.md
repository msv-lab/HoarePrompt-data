Output State: **`trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank` if `suit` equals `trump`, otherwise `trumps` is an empty list, and now `trumps` includes the additional value `rank`; `trump` holds the value of the second line of input (trump suit); `answers` is a list containing one string ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]) if `suits[suit]` was not `None` and `suit` does not equal `trump`, otherwise `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}` except `suits[suit]` which is `rank` if `suits[suit]` was `None` and `suit` does not equal `trump`, otherwise `suits[suit]` remains `None`; `rank` is the rank part of the `card` string; `suit` is the suit part of the `card` string.**

In simpler terms, the `trumps` list now includes an additional entry of `rank` if `suit` matches `trump`. All other variables remain unchanged.
