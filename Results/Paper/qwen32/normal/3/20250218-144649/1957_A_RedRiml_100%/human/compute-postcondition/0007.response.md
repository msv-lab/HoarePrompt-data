Postcondition: ***`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, and `d.get(i)` is `None`***

This postcondition retains all the conditions from the precondition and includes the additional information that `d.get(i)` is `None` after entering the if condition.
