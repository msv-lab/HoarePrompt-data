The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the element `i` to the list `pl`. Therefore, `pl` now contains `i` as an additional element. The other variables, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `d`, remain unchanged in terms of their values and conditions.

Output State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list that now contains the element `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `d` initially, `d` contains a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.**
