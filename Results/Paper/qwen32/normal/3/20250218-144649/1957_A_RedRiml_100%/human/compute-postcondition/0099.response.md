The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `pl` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is a list that exists but its contents are not specified. The other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, `i`, and `d`) remain unchanged. The value of `i` is added to the end of `pl`.

Output State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the next element in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d` did not have the key `i` before the execution, it now has the key `i` with the value `1`. If `d` already had the key `i`, its value is incremented by 1. `pl` now includes `i` as its last element.**
