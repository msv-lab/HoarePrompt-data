The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `palka`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last element processed from `palka`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `palka` to be processed.

Given that `palka` must have at least 2 integers, and we've just processed one of them, `palka` must still have at least one more integer remaining to be processed. Therefore, `i` should be the next element in `palka`.

State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list that contains the element `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `d` initially, `d` contains a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
