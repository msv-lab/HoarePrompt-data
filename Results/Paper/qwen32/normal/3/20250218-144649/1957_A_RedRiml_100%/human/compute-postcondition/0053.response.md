The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `pl`. This means that the list `pl` now contains one more element, which is `i`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element, `pl` is a list containing the current value of `i`, `d` is a dictionary, if `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d[i]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by `1`. The current value of `i` is not in `pl` (before the append operation). `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
