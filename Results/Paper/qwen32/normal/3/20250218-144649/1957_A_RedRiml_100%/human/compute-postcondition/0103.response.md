Output State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`, `d` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` was not in `pl` before the execution, `pl` now includes `i` as its last element.**

In simple terms: The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` was not already in the list `pl`, it is now added to the end of `pl`. All other variables retain their previous values.
