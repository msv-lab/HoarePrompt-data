The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If `pl` has more elements, the loop can execute again for the next element in `pl`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the last element of `pl`. For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must have at least one more element, and `j` must be updated to the next element in `pl`.

Let's denote the next element in `pl` as `pl[next_index]`, where `next_index` is the current index of `j` plus one.

State: **`w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is the previous value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged, `j` is `pl[next_index]`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `next_index`, we can denote the next element in `pl` as `pl[index + 1]` if `j` was `pl[index]` in the previous iteration. However, we can simply denote it as the next element in `pl`.

If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is the previous value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged, `j` is the next element in `pl`**.
