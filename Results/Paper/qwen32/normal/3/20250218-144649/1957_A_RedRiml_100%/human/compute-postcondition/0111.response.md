The code snippet `shapes += d[j] // 3` increments the value of `shapes` by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. Given that `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, the value of `shapes` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the new input, `pl` is a list of all unique integers from `palka` and has at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `palka` and values as their respective counts, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`, `j` is the first element in `pl`, and `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

In natural language: The value of `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the count of the first unique integer `j` in the list `palka` by 3. All other variables retain their initial values.
