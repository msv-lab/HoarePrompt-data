The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `w`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `w`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable in this context, it is incremented automatically by the `for` loop construct and does not need to be manually adjusted in the state description. The only variable we need to adjust is `w` to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `w` must be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, because the loop automatically increments `_` and checks if `_` is less than `w`.

However, since the loop control variable `_` is incremented internally and we need to ensure the loop will run one more time, we actually need to increment `w` by 1 at the start of the next iteration to allow for another loop execution.

State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from `palka`, and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
