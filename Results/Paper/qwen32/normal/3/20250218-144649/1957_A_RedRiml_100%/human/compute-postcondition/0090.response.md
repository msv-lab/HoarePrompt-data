The code snippet provided increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `d[i]` is not explicitly given, but we know it is not `None`, so it must be an integer. After the increment, the value of `d[i]` will be its previous value plus 1.

Other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `shapes`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary except `d[i]` which is now `d[i] + 1`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, and `d.get(i)` is not `None`**.
