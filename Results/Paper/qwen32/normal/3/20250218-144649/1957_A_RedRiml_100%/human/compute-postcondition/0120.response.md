To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and understand the variables involved:

1. **`w`**: This variable is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. However, it is not used in the calculation of `shapes`, so we can ignore it for this task.

2. **`ln`**: This is the new input integer, but it doesn't seem to be used directly in the calculation of `shapes` either. It might be related to the input process, but it doesn't affect the final value of `shapes`.

3. **`palka`**: This is a list of integers from the new input. The exact values in this list are not provided, so we will represent them as `palka = [x1, x2, ..., xn]`.

4. **`pl`**: This is a list of all unique integers from `palka`. If `palka = [x1, x2, ..., xn]`, then `pl` would be a list of distinct values from this list, i.e., `pl = [y1, y2, ..., ym]` where `m` is the number of unique integers in `palka`.

5. **`d`**: This is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `palka` and values as their respective counts. If `palka = [x1, x2, ..., xn]`, then `d` would be a dictionary like `{y1: count_y1, y2: count_y2, ..., ym: count_ym}` where `count_yi` is the number of times the integer `yi` appears in `palka`.

6. **`shapes`**: This is calculated as the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3. This means we are counting how many groups of 3 each unique integer can form from the list `palka`.

Given this, the `print(shapes)` statement will output the total number of groups of 3 that can be formed from the counts of each unique integer in `palka`.

Since the exact values of `palka` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `palka` by 3, considering only counts that are greater than or equal to 3)**
