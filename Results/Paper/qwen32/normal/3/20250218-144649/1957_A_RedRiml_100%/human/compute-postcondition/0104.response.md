Postcondition: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `d` before the execution, `d` now includes the key `i` with the value `1`. If `i` was already in `d`, its value is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `i` was not in `pl` before the execution, `pl` now includes `i` as its last element.**
