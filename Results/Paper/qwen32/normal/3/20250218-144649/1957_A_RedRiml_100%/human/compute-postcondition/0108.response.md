The code snippet sets `shapes` to 0. This means that the value of `shapes` is now 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the new input, `pl` is a list of all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `palka` and values as their respective counts, and `shapes` is 0.**
