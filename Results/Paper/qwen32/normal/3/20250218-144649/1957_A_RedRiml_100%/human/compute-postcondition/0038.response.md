Postcondition: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged. `j` is the next element in `pl` that hasn't been processed yet. The value of `shapes` has been updated by adding `d[j] // 3` to it if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**
