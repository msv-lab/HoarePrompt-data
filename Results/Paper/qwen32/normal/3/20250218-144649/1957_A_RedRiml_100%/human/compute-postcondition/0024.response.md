Postcondition: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list that contains the element `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `d` initially, `d` contains a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.`**
