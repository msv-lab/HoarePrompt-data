The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `palka`. The initial state of `w` and `ln` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
