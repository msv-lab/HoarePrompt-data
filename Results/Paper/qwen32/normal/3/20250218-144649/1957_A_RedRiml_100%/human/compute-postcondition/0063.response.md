The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. If `d[i]` was `None` before, it will be set to 1 (since `None + 1` is not valid in Python, the initial state specifies that `d[i]` will be 1 if it was `None` before). If `d[i]` already had a value, it will be incremented by 1.

Given the initial state, the values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `shapes` remain unchanged. The only change is in the dictionary `d` where the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from new input and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1, `pl` contains the current value of `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, and `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
