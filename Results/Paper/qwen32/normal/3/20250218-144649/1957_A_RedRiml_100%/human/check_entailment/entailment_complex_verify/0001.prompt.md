You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.

                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: the printed value of `shapes` for each of the `w` test cases, one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of stick lengths. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the sticks, where each triangle requires three sticks of the same length.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons (equal-sided) that can be formed using given sticks, where each polygon must have at least 3 sides and no stick can be reused.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Frequencies:**
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It also initializes an empty list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths.
   - For each stick length `i` in `palka`, it updates the count in `d` and adds the length to `pl` if it hasn't been added yet.

3. **Calculating Maximum Number of Polygons:**
   - It initializes a variable `shapes` to count the maximum number of polygons.
   - For each unique stick length `j` in `pl`, it checks if the count of sticks of length `j` (`d[j]`) is at least 3.
   - If so, it adds the integer division of `d[j]` by 3 to `shapes`. This is because a polygon requires at least 3 sticks of the same length.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the value of `shapes`.

### Correctness Check:

- **Handling Small Numbers of Sticks:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where there are fewer than 3 sticks by not adding to `shapes` (since `d[j] < 3`).

- **Counting Polygons:**
  - The program correctly counts the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 and summing these values.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where there are multiple stick lengths and multiple polygons can be formed (as seen in the fourth test case of the example).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program efficiently counts stick frequencies using a dictionary and processes each test case in linear time relative to the number of sticks.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
