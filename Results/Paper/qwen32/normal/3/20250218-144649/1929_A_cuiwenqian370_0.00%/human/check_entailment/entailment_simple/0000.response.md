### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements.

The provided program follows a strategy to achieve this. It sorts the array and then rearranges it in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Rearranging the Array**: By placing the largest and smallest elements alternately, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in the rearranged array.

The provided annotated program correctly implements this strategy. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step verification:

- **Sorting**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
- **Alternating Pattern**: Elements are appended to `new_arr` starting with the largest element, then the smallest, then the second largest, and so on.
- **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is computed by iterating through `new_arr` and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

The provided example outputs match the expected results, indicating that the program is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly rearranges the array to maximize the beauty and computes the correct result for each test case.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program sorts the array and rearranges it in an alternating pattern of largest and smallest elements to maximize the beauty. The beauty is then calculated correctly by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.
Correctness: **True**
