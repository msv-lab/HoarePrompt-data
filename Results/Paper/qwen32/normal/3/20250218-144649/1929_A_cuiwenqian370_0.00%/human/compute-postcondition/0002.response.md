Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `left` has been assigned the value 0, while all other variables (`n`, `arr`, and `new_arr`) retain their initial values and conditions.
