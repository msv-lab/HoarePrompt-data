Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`; `new_arr` is an empty list.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100, inclusive. The list `arr` remains a sorted list of integers, each between 1 and 10^9, with a length equal to `n`. A new variable `new_arr` is introduced and initialized as an empty list.
