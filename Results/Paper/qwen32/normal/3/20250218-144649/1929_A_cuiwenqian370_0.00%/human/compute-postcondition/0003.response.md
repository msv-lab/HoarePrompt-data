Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`.**

In simple terms: The variable `right` has been assigned the value `n - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
