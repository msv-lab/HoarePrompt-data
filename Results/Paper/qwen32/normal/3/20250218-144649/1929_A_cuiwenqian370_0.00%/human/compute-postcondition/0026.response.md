Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`. If `left` equals `right`, `left` is adjusted such that `left` is less than `right`. Otherwise, no adjustment needed. `new_arr` contains the element at index `left` of `arr` if `left` was equal to `right`, and `new_arr` contains the elements `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` if `left` was not equal to `right`. `left` has been incremented by 1. `right` has been decremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `right` has been decreased by 1, while the values of `n`, `arr`, `new_arr`, and `left` remain unchanged from their initial state.
