To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition `left <= right`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`.
- If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` contains the elements at index `left` and `right` of `arr`, and both `left` and `right` are either 0 or `n - 1`.
- Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the largest element of `arr`, `arr[0]`, and the element at index `right` of `arr`, `left` is 1 or 2, and `right` is `n - 3`.

The loop condition is `left <= right`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

### Analysis:

1. **If `left` equals `right`:**
   - The loop can execute one more time if `left` and `right` are not equal after the previous iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust `left` and `right` such that `left` is less than `right`.

2. **If `left` is not equal to `right`:**
   - The loop can execute one more time if `left` is still less than or equal to `right` after the previous iteration. Therefore, no adjustment is needed if this condition is already satisfied.

### Adjustment:

- Since the condition is `left <= right`, we need to ensure that `left` is not greater than `right` after the previous iteration.
- If `left` equals `right` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust it so that `left` is less than `right`.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `left` is less than `right` if `left` was equal to `right` at the end of the previous iteration. If `left` was already less than `right`, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`. If `left` equals `right`, adjust such that `left` is less than `right`. Otherwise, no adjustment needed.**
