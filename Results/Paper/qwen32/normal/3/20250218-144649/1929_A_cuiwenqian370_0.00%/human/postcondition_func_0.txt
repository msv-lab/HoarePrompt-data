The function takes an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` of length `n`, sorts the list, and then rearranges it such that the elements alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. It calculates and returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in this rearranged list.
