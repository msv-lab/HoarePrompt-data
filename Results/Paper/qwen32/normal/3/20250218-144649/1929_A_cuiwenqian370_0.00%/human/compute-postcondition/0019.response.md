Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`. If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` contains the elements at index `left` and `right` of `arr`, and both `left` and `right` are either 0 or `n - 1`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the largest element of `arr`, `arr[0]`, and the element at index `right` of `arr`, `left` is 1 or 2, and `right` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is decremented by 1, so if `right` was `n - 2`, it is now `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
