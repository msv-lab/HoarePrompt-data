Output State: **`new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in a new order: the largest element, the smallest element, the second largest element, the second smallest element, and so on; `left` and `right` are not yet compared, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `max_beauty` is `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1]) + abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])`.**

In simple terms, the value of `max_beauty` has been updated by adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[3]` and `new_arr[2]` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
