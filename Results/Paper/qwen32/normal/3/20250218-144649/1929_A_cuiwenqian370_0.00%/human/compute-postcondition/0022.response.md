Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`. If `left` equals `right`, adjust such that `left` is less than `right`. Otherwise, no adjustment needed. `new_arr` is a list that contains the element `arr[right]` appended to it.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains the same, and `arr` remains unchanged as a sorted list of integers. The condition regarding `left` and `right` remains unchanged. The list `new_arr` now includes the element at the `right` index of `arr`.
