Output State: **`new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in a new order: the largest element, the smallest element, the second largest element, the second smallest element, and so on; `left` and `right` are not yet compared, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `max_beauty` is `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])`.**

In this output state, the value of `max_beauty` has been updated to include the absolute difference between `new_arr[2]` and `new_arr[1]`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
