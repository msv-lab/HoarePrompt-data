The provided Python code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the standard output. However, this command does not change the values of any variables in the program. It only affects the output stream.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is at least 1
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`
- `i` is `i + 1`

None of these variables are affected by the `sys.stdout.flush()` command. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
