Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is the new value of `i` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1.**
