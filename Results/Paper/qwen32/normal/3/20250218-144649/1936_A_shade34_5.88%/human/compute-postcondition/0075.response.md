The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `mak`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was `>`, or 0 if no such element exists.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `n` is the input integer; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`; `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was `>`, or 0 if no such element exists.**
