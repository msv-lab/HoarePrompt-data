The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` (number of test cases) is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `s` is the input string.
- Depending on the value of `s`, `mak` and `pans` are modified, but these do not affect the loop head.

Since the loop is `for i in range(n)`, `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 1.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the input string; `i` is increased by 1**.

Let's put this into the required format:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`**. 

Since we don't have a specific value for `i` from the previous state, we express the new state of `i` as `i + 1`.
