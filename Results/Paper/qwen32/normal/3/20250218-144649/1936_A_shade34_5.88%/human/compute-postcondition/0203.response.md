The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. However, it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Thus, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, or `pans` are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements.**
