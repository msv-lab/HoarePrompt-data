The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(pans)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pans`. The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last valid index that was processed, and `pans` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `len(pans)`.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k` where `1 <= k < len(pans) - 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it to the next valid index.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, to be more explicit about the state transition:

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1 if this is the first iteration of the loop, otherwise `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration**

Given the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `k + 1`**

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1**

Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `i + 1`**

Given that `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `k + 1`**

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1**

Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it to the next valid index.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1**

Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `i + 1`
