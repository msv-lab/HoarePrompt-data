The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Since `i` is not set in the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `mak` because `i` has no defined value. Therefore, `mak` remains equal to `mak2` as it was initially.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list, `i` is not set, `s` is the input string, and `s` is equal to '<'.**
