The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since `mak2` is already set to the final value of `mak`, and `mak` is being updated to `i`, `mak2` remains unchanged with the previous value of `mak`. The values of `t`, `n`, `pans`, and `s` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`, `mak` is `i`, and the current input string `s` is `<`.**
