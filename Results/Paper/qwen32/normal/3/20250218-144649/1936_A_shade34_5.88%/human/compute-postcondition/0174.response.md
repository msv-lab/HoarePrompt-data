The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `mak`. However, we can state that `mak` now holds the value of `i`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, `s`) remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `s` still hold true.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the final value of `mak`, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the input string and `s` equals '<', `mak` is the value of `i`.**
