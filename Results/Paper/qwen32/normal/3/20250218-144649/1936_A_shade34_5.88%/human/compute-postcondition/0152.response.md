The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not change the values of any variables; it only ensures that all output to the standard output (stdout) is immediately flushed. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, or `mak` are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`, `mak` is 0**.
