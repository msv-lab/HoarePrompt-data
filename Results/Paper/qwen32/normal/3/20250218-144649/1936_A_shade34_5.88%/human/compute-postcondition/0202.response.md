Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is at least 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
2. `n` is the input integer (though `n` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
3. `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop (though `mak2` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
4. `mak` is initialized to 0.
5. `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- `mak` is initialized to 0, so `pans[mak]` translates to `pans[0]`, which is the first element of the `pans` list.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement. Since `i` is not mentioned to be assigned any specific value in the initial state, we can assume that `i` is a variable that has been assigned a value somewhere in the code before this print statement. However, the problem statement does not provide information about the value of `i`. Given that `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `i` could be any valid index of `pans`, but without additional context, we can only describe it as an index `i` of `pans`.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`, which is the first element of the `pans` list.
- `pans[i]` is the element at index `i` of the `pans` list, where `i` is an index of `pans`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i`, we will describe it as `pans[i]`.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[i] is the element at index i of the pans list)**
