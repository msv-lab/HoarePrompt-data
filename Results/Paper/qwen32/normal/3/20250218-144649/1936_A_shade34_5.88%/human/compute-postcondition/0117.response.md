The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those for the next iteration of the loop. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 2, `mak2` is equal to `mak` or `mak2` is 1, `i` is 2, `s` is the new input string. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[None]` or `[None, 1]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]` or `[1, 1]`. Otherwise, `pans` is an empty list or `[1]`**
