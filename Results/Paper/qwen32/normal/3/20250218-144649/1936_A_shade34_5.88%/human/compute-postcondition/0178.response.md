The given code snippet is `pans.append(i)`. This line of code appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. 

Initial State: `t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the final value of `mak`, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the input string, `s` is not equal to '<', and `s` is equal to '='.

After the code `pans.append(i)` is executed, the list `pans` will no longer be empty but will contain the element `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing the element `i`, `s` is the input string, `s` is not equal to '<', and `s` is equal to '='.**
