The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, and if the current input is `<`, `mak` is set to the current index `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Given that `i` is currently at the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is set based on the current input, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we are only adjusting the variables in the loop head, the specific values of `t`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `mak` remain unchanged, and we only adjust `i`.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is set based on the current input, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 2 at the start of the next iteration. If `i` was 2, it should be 3, and so on.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is set based on the current input, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 1**

If we assume `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is set based on the current input, `i` is 2**

If we do not assume a specific value for `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is set based on the current input, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 1**

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is set based on the current input, `i` is 2**
