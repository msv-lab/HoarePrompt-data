The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it iterates over, which is determined by `len(pans)`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `len(pans)` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing at least 4 indices, `i` is 3**
