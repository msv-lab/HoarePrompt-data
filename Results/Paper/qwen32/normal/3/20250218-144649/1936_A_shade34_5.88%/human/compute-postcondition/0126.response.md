Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=`. If the input string `s` was `<` at any point, `mak` is set to the last index `i` for which `s` was `<` and `pans` contains only that index.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop:
- `t` remains unchanged and is at least 0.
- `n` remains the input integer, indicating the total number of iterations.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak` at the end of the loop.
- `pans` contains all the indices `i` where the input string `s` was `=`.
- If at any point the input string `s` was `<`, `mak` is set to the last index `i` where this happened, and `pans` will only contain this index.
