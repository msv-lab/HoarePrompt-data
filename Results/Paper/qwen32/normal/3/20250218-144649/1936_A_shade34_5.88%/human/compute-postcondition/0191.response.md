Let's break down the given Initial State and the print statement to understand the output:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is at least 0.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `mak2` is the final value of `mak`.
   - `s` is the new input string.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If `s` equals '<', then `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1]`.
   - If `s` equals '=', then `pans` has been updated to include the value 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is printing the following values: `'?'`, `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.
   - From the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - We also know that `mak2` is the final value of `mak`. However, the exact value of `mak` depends on the value of `s`.
     - If `s` equals '<', then `mak` is 1.
     - If `s` equals '=', the value of `mak` is not specified, but since `mak2` is the final value of `mak`, and no other conditions are mentioned, we can assume `mak` remains unchanged from its initial value if `s` is not '<'. However, the information provided does not give a clear indication of `mak`'s value when `s` is not '<'. For the sake of this problem, we will consider the scenario where `s` is '<' as it is the only explicitly defined case.
   - Given `s` equals '<', `mak` is 1, and thus `mak2` (the final value of `mak`) is also 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output: `'?'`, `mak` (which is 1), `mak2` (which is also 1), `i` (which is 2), and `mak2` again (which is 1).

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **? 1 1 2 1**
