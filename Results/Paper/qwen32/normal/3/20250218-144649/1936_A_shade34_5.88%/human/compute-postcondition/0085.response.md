The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the standard output. This does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, `mak`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is set based on the current input, `i` is 2**.
