The value of `mak` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `i` was `i + 1` before the assignment, so `mak` now holds that value. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`, and `mak` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the new input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `mak` is `i + 1`**.
