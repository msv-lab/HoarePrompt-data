The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `mak` will be set to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 3, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is 3, and `i` is 3.**
