The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `pans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, and `mak2` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak` is the largest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `mak2` is equal to `mak`; `pans` is an empty list.**
