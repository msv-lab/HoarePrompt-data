In the given for loop, the loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. The variables `t` (number of test cases) and `mak` (which is initialized to 0) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. The only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`.

Let's break it down:

- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` is the loop control variable and will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop, so it doesn't need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is `n` to ensure it is greater than 1.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `mak` is 0**
