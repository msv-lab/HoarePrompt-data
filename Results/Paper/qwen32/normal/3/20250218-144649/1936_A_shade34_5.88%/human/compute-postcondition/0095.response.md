The provided code snippet is `pans = []`, which reassigns the variable `pans` to an empty list. This means any previous values stored in `pans` are discarded, and `pans` is now an empty list. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `mak2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list.**
