The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we will denote the new value of `mak` as `i`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is `i`, and the current input is `<`**.

In natural language, `mak` is now equal to `i`, while all other variables retain their initial conditions.
