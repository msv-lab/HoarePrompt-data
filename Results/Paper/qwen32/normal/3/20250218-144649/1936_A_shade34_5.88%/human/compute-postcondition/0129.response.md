Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is the input integer (though `n` is also not used in the print statement).
- `mak2` is equal to `mak` (though `mak2` is not used in the print statement).
- `pans` is a list containing at least two indices.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement includes the character `'?'` followed by four elements from the `pans` list.
- The elements are: `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`.
- `mak` is an index into the `pans` list, but its value is not specified in the initial state.
- `i` is also an index into the `pans` list, but its value is not specified in the initial state.

Since the exact values of `mak` and `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these indices.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a '?' followed by the value at index `mak` in the `pans` list twice, and the value at index `i` in the `pans` list twice.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak and i are indices into the pans list)**
