The code snippet provided is `pans = []`, which reinitializes the list `pans` to an empty list. This means that whatever the previous contents of `pans` were, they are now gone, and `pans` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak`, `pans` is an empty list.**
