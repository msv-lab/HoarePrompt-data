The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the integer input provided.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again from its current value.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `l` is the input integer
- `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element at index `j` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`
- `array` is a list of integers read from the input
- `ans` is a string formed by appending characters `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in `array`
- `i` is incremented by 1

State at the end of the previous iteration: `i` has been incremented by 1.

For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element at index `j` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is a string formed by appending characters `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, it should now be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element at index `j` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is a string formed by appending characters `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by 1 (i.e., if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, now `i` is `x + 1`)**.

Simplified State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element at index `j` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is a string formed by appending characters `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can denote it as incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element at index `j` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is a string formed by appending characters `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by 1**
