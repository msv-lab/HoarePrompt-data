The code snippet appends a character to the string `ans`. Specifically, it appends the character represented by `chr(s[j] + 97)`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` already contains the string `'a'` followed by `chr(s[j] + 97)`. After executing the code, `ans` will now contain the original `ans` string followed by an additional character `chr(s[j] + 97)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is the input integer; `s` is a list of `l` integers where `s[j]` has been incremented by 1; `array` is a list of integers read from the input and must have more than one element; `ans` is a string containing the character `'a'` followed by the character `chr(s[j] + 97)` and then another character `chr(s[j] + 97)`, `j` is the next element in `array`.**
