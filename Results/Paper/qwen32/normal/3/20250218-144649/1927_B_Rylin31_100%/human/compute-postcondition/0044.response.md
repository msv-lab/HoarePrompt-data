The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` modifies the variable `ans` by appending a character to it. Here's the step-by-step impact of the code:

1. `s[j]` is 2 as per the initial state.
2. `chr(s[j] + 97)` translates to `chr(2 + 97)`, which is `chr(99)`. The ASCII value 99 corresponds to the character 'c'.
3. `ans` was initially `'ab'`. After appending 'c' to it, `ans` becomes `'abc'`.

The other variables (`t`, `l`, `s`, `array`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is the newly input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 2, `array` is a newly input list of integers that must have at least one element, `ans` is `'abc'`, `j` is the next element in `array` if it exists**.
