The code snippet creates a list `s` with `l` elements, all initialized to 0. The values of `t` and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `t` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `l` is still the input integer, with `s` being a list of `l` zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of `l` zeros.**
