### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its behavior against the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of cliques `cliques` as the ceiling of `n / k`.
   - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
   - It then calls `make_array` for each segment of length `k` (or less for the last segment) to fill `arr` and `cliquess` with appropriate values.
   - Finally, it prints the values of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the values of `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function fills a segment of `arr` from index `left` to `right` with a specific sequence of numbers.
   - The first half of the segment is filled with increasing numbers starting from `left + 1`.
   - The second half of the segment is filled with decreasing numbers starting from `right + 1`.
   - It also sets the corresponding values in `cliquess` to the given `clique` number.

#### Issues:
- The function `func_1` and `make_array` do not ensure that the graph formed by the assigned integers `a_i` will have edges between vertices `(i, j)` if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
- The code does not construct the graph and check the edge condition. It simply assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` without considering the edge condition.
- The partitioning into cliques is based on the length of `k`, but it does not guarantee that all vertices in a clique are connected by an edge.
- The problem requires a graph partitioning strategy that ensures each clique is a valid clique (all pairs of vertices in the clique are connected by an edge).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the graph formed by the assigned integers `a_i` will have the required edges between vertices `(i, j)` if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. Additionally, the partitioning strategy does not guarantee that the graph is correctly partitioned into the minimum number of valid cliques.

**Correctness: False**
