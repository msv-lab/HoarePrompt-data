The code snippet `arr[left + i] = small_element + i` updates the value of `arr[left + i]` to be `small_element + i`.

Given:
- `small_element` is `left + 1`
- `i` is incremented by 1 in the loop

After the code execution:
- `arr[left + i]` will be `left + 1 + i`

The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and `cliquess[left + i]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right is at least left + 2, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is left + 1, `big_element` is right + 1, `mid` is (right - left) // 2, `not_mid` is right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2, `arr[left + i]` is left + 1 + i, `cliquess[left + i]` is clique for each i from 0 to mid, `i` is incremented by 1**.
