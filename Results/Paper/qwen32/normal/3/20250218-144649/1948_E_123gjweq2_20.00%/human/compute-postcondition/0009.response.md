Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right is at least left + 2, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is left + 1, `big_element` is right + 1, `mid` is (right - left) // 2, `not_mid` is right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2, `arr[left + i]` is left + 1 + i, `cliquess[left + i]` is clique for each i from 0 to mid, and for the current `i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value at `cliquess[left + i]` has been updated to `clique`. All other variables retain their previous values.
