Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Graph Construction**: We need to assign each vertex an integer from 1 to n such that no two integers are the same.
2. **Edge Addition**: For every pair of vertices (i, j), add an edge if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
3. **Clique Partition**: Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques where every vertex belongs to exactly one clique. A clique is a set of vertices where every pair is connected by an edge.

### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
  - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
  - Initializes two arrays: `arr` (to hold the assigned integers) and `cliquess` (to hold the clique numbers for each vertex).
  - Calls `make_array` for each clique to fill the arrays.
  - Prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.

- **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
  - Fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for the given range `[left, right]` with the specified clique number.
  - It tries to assign integers in a way that might satisfy the edge condition, but the logic seems flawed.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initialization of Global Arrays**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are defined inside `make_array`, but they are used in `func_1`. This will cause issues because `arr` and `cliquess` are not defined in the global scope.
2. **Logic for Assigning Integers**: The logic inside `make_array` does not guarantee that the assigned integers will satisfy the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \). The assignment seems arbitrary and may not form valid cliques.
3. **Minimum Number of Cliques**: The program attempts to minimize the number of cliques by calculating `ceil(n / k)`, but this is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques required to satisfy the edge condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to guarantee that the assigned integers form valid cliques and does not necessarily minimize the number of cliques.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
