### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it meets the problem requirements.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Graph Construction:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to `n` to vertices 1 to `n`.
   - An edge is added between vertices `i` and `j` if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

2. **Clique Partitioning:**
   - The graph must be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
   - Each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.
   - A clique is a set of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output:
     - The values `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` assigned to the vertices.
     - The number of cliques `q`.
     - The partition `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` indicating the clique each vertex belongs to.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
- **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
  - The function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
  - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
  - It calls `make_array` to fill segments of `arr` and `cliquess` with consecutive integers and clique numbers, respectively.

- **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`:**
  - This function fills a segment of `arr` from index `left` to `right` with a sequence of numbers.
  - The first half of the segment is filled with increasing numbers starting from `left + 1`.
  - The second half is filled with decreasing numbers starting from `right + 1`.
  - It simultaneously sets the corresponding segment of `cliquess` to the given `clique` number.

#### Issues and Verification:
1. **Graph Construction:**
   - The provided code does not explicitly construct the graph based on the edge condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. Instead, it assigns clique numbers based on the segment of `k` elements.
   
2. **Clique Partitioning:**
   - The code attempts to partition the vertices into `ceil(n / k)` cliques by assigning consecutive clique numbers to segments of `k` elements.
   - However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. It simply groups vertices into `ceil(n / k)` groups without considering the actual edge connections.

3. **Example Verification:**
   - For `n = 5` and `k = 4`, the code might output:
     - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
     - `cliques = 2`
     - `cliquess = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`
   - However, the correct output could be:
     - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
     - `cliques = 1`
     - `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - This is because all vertices can be in the same clique if the edge condition is satisfied for all pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly ensure that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. It simply groups vertices into `ceil(n / k)` segments without considering the actual edge connections required by the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
