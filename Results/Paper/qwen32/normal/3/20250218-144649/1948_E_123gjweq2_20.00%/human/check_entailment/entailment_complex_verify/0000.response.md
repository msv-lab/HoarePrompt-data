### Reasoning:

Let's critically analyze the original assessment and the annotated code to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Global Variables**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. This is indeed not a good practice. However, the global variables are initialized and modified within the functions, and the program handles each test case separately. This means that the variables are not shared across different test cases, and the program should still work correctly for each individual test case. However, it would be better practice to pass these variables as parameters or return them from functions.

2. **Logic in `make_array`**:
   - The `make_array` function fills segments of the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays with specific sequences. However, the current implementation does not guarantee that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs within the same clique. The logic simply assigns values in a way that does not ensure the required condition.
   - Let's verify this with an example. Consider `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program might output:
     ```
     1 2 3 4 5
     1
     1 1 1 1 1
     ```
     Here, the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 4 \) is not satisfied for all pairs. For instance, for vertices 1 and 5, \( |1 - 5| + |1 - 5| = 8 \), which is greater than 4. Therefore, vertices 1 and 5 should not be in the same clique.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is small or `k` is large, the program should ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The current implementation does not guarantee this.
   - The example provided in the original assessment shows that the program can produce an incorrect partitioning. For `n = 5` and `k = 4`, a correct output could be:
     ```
     1 3 5 2 4
     2
     1 1 1 2 2
     ```
     Here, vertices 1, 3, and 5 form one clique, and vertices 2 and 4 form another clique, satisfying the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 4 \).

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program should print the output for each test case as specified in the problem description. The current implementation does handle multiple test cases correctly, but the logic within the functions is flawed, leading to incorrect partitioning.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the required logic to ensure that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs within the same clique. The logic in `make_array` is flawed, and the program does not handle edge cases properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
