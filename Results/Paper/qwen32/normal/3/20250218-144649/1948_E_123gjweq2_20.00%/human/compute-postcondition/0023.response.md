To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop and the provided initial and intermediate states.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Loop Variable:** `i` ranges from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.
- **Loop Body:**
  - `arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i`
  - `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique`

### Initial State:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`.
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.
- `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`.

### Intermediate States:
- **After 1 iteration:** `arr[left + mid]` is set to `big_element - 0`, and `cliquess[left + mid]` is set to `clique`.
- **After 2 iterations:** `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`, and `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is set to `clique`.
- **After 3 iterations:** `arr[left + mid + 2]` is set to `big_element - 2`, and `cliquess[left + mid + 2]` is set to `clique`.

### Final State:
The loop will execute `not_mid` times. After all iterations:
- `arr[left + mid + i]` will be `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` will be `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.

### Final Output State:
- `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
- `clique` remains unchanged.
- `small_element` remains `left + 1`.
- `big_element` remains `right + 1`.
- `mid` remains `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` remains `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.
- `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`.
- `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid + not_mid - 1`.

In natural language, this means:
- The first half of the segment from `left` to `right` (up to `mid`) in `arr` remains unchanged.
- The second half of the segment from `left + mid` to `right` in `arr` is filled with values starting from `big_element` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent element.
- The `cliquess` array is filled with the `clique` value for the entire segment from `left` to `right`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid + not_mid - 1`.**
