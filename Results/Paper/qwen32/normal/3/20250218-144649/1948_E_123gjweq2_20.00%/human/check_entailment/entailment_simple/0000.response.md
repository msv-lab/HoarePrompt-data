Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by assigning integers to vertices and partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques. However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The function `make_array` is not defined within the provided code. The function `make_array` is referenced in `func_1`, but its definition is not provided. This will lead to a `NameError` at runtime.

2. Even if `make_array` were defined, the logic of the program seems flawed. The program assigns integers to vertices in a way that does not guarantee the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The assignment of integers and the creation of cliques should ensure that the condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| â‰¤ k holds for all pairs of vertices in the same clique. The current logic does not ensure this condition.

3. The program calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`. This seems like a reasonable starting point, but it does not ensure the minimum number of cliques. The actual minimum number of cliques can be less than this in some cases.

4. The program does not check if the graph can be partitioned into the calculated number of cliques. It simply assigns integers and creates cliques without verifying the connectivity condition.

5. The program does not provide a correct partition of the graph into cliques. The `cliquess` list, which is supposed to represent the partition, does not necessarily reflect the actual cliques in the graph.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
