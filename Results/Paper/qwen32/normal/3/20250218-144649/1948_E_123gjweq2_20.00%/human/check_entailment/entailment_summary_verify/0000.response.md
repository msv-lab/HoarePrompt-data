### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summary in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Graph Construction**: We need to assign distinct integers to vertices such that if the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied, there is an edge between vertices \( i \) and \( j \).
2. **Clique Partitioning**: The graph must be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and then calls `make_array` to fill `arr` and `cliquess`.
- **Function `make_array`**: This function fills a segment of `arr` and `cliquess` based on a specific pattern. The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `make_array`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Global Variables**: The functions use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. The variables should be passed as parameters or returned from functions.
2. **Logic in `make_array`**: The logic in `make_array` does not necessarily ensure that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs within the same clique. The current implementation just assigns values in a way that does not guarantee the required condition.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is small or `k` is large, the program should ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The current implementation does not guarantee this.
4. **Output Format**: The program should print the output for each test case as specified in the problem description. The current implementation does not handle multiple test cases correctly.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`:
- The program might output:
  ```
  1 2 3 4 5
  1
  1 1 1 1 1
  ```
- However, a correct output could be:
  ```
  1 3 5 2 4
  2
  1 1 1 2 2
  ```
- Here, vertices 1, 3, and 5 form one clique, and vertices 2 and 4 form another clique, satisfying the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 4 \).

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the required logic to ensure that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs within the same clique. Additionally, the program does not handle multiple test cases correctly and uses global variables, which is not a good practice.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
