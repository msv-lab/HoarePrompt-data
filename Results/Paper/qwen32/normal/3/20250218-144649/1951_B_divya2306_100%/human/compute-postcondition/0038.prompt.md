You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: The loop will execute until it finds an element `a[i]` that is greater than `a[k-1]` or until it has checked all elements. If it checks all elements without finding one greater than `a[k-1]`, `i` will be `n` and `wins` will be `n`. If it breaks early, `i` will be the index where the condition `a[i] > a[k-1]` is met, and `wins` will be the number of elements checked before breaking.
    #
    #In natural language:
    #- The variable `i` will be the index where the loop broke (i.e., the first index `i` such that `a[i] > a[k-1]`), or `n` if no such index exists.
    #- The variable `wins` will be the number of elements in `a` up to index `i-1` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`, or `n` if all elements are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`.
    #
    #Output State:
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements checked before breaking the loop or `n` if the loop checks all elements)
        return
        #The program returns nothing (None)
    #State: The loop will execute until it finds an element `a[i]` that is greater than `a[k-1]` or until it has checked all elements. If it checks all elements without finding one greater than `a[k-1]`, `i` will be `n` and `wins` will be `n`. If it breaks early, `i` will be the index where the condition `a[i] > a[k-1]` is met, and `wins` will be the number of elements checked before breaking. Additionally, `wins` will be less than `k`.
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: `win_with_swap` is `k` and `i` is `k-1`.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: max(wins - 1, k - wins) if wins != 0, otherwise k - 1 (where wins is an unknown integer and k is the value of win_with_swap)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It performs some operations based on the input values provided through other means (possibly global variables or input functions) and returns nothing (None).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing (None)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
