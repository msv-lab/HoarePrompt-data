You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements for all potential cases. Let's break down the logic and identify the issues:

1. **Initial Wins Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the initial number of wins if no swap is made by iterating through the list from the start and counting how many cows have a rating less than or equal to the cow at position `k`.
   - This part seems correct based on the problem description.

2. **Handling the Swap**:
   - The code then attempts to calculate the maximum number of wins if a swap is made.
   - It increments the `wins` variable by 1 to account for the swap.
   - It then iterates from the position `win_with_swap` to `k-2` (inclusive) and counts additional wins if the cow at position `k` can beat the cows in these positions.
   - The logic for calculating `win_with_swap` is flawed. The code does not correctly determine the best position to swap the cow to maximize wins.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Swap Logic**:
  - The code does not correctly determine the best position to swap the cow to maximize wins. It simply adds 1 to the initial wins and then checks a limited range of positions, which is not sufficient.
  - The code does not consider all possible positions to swap the cow to and then re-evaluate the entire tournament to find the maximum wins.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
5 3
10 20 5 30 25
```
- **Without Swap**:
  - The cow at position 3 has a rating of 5.
  - It can only win against the cow at position 1 (rating 10).
  - Total wins without swap = 1.

- **With Swap**:
  - If we swap the cow at position 3 with the cow at position 4 (rating 30), the new order becomes: `10 20 30 5 25`.
  - The cow at position 3 (now with rating 30) can win all matches:
    - First match: 10 vs 20 (20 wins)
    - Second match: 20 vs 30 (30 wins)
    - Third match: 30 vs 5 (30 wins)
    - Fourth match: 30 vs 25 (30 wins)
  - Total wins with swap = 3.

The provided code will not correctly calculate the maximum wins in this scenario because it does not properly evaluate all possible swaps and their outcomes.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly the logic for determining the best swap position and calculating the maximum wins. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
