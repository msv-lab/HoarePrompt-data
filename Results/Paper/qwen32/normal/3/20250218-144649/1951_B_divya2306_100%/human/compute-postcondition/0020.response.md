Postcondition: **The loop will execute until it finds an element `a[i]` that is greater than `a[k-1]` or until it has checked all elements. If it checks all elements without finding one greater than `a[k-1]`, `i` will be `n` and `wins` will be `n`. If it breaks early, `i` will be the index where the condition `a[i] > a[k-1]` is met, and `wins` will be the number of elements checked before breaking. Additionally, `wins` will be less than `k`.**
