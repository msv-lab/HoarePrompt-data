The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `trumps`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `trump`, `cards`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `t`, `n`, `trump`, and `cards` with the addition of the newly initialized `trumps` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, `trump` is the input character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}, and `cards` is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings where each string consists of a rank from '2' to '9' and a suit from 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'; `trumps` is an empty list.**
