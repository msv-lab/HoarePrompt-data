Output State: **`trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, except the last element which was removed and used in the `answers` list if `trumps` was not empty. `answers` will contain the original strings plus a new string formatted as '10spades {last_trump_card}{trump}' if `trumps` was not empty. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing (None). `suits` is a dictionary with at least two entries, e.g., `{'hearts': None, 'spades': 10}`. `suit` is 'hearts' and `rank` is None.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change any variables or the state of the program. It simply skips the rest of the loop body and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values and conditions.
