The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, except the last element which was removed and used in the `answers` list. `answers` will contain the original strings plus a new string formatted as '{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'. `suits` is a dictionary with at least two entries, e.g., `{'hearts': None, 'spades': 10}`. `suit` is 'spades' and `rank` is 10.**
