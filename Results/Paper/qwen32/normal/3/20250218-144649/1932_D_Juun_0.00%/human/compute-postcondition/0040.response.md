Postcondition: **`trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, and `trumps` will be an empty list. `answers` will contain strings representing pairs of cards from non-trump suits, sorted by rank. `suits` is a dictionary with at least one entry, e.g., `{'hearts': None}`. If `rank` is `None`, the current value of `rank` remains `None`.**
