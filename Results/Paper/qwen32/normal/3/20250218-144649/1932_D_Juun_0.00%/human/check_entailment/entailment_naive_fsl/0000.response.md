Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all possible cases correctly. Here are a few issues and edge cases that the program does not address:

1. **Trump Cards Handling**: The program sorts the trump cards and pairs them in ascending order. However, this does not guarantee that a higher-ranked trump card will be used to beat a lower-ranked one. The program should try to use the smallest possible trump card that can beat a non-trump card.

2. **Non-Trump Cards Pairing**: When pairing non-trump cards, the program simply sorts the cards and pairs them. However, it does not ensure that the second card in each pair can actually beat the first card. For example, if the first player plays a card of a certain suit, the second player must play a card of the same suit with a higher rank.

3. **Edge Case with Single Card**: If there is only one card left in the `trumps` list after pairing non-trump cards, the program will print "IMPOSSIBLE" because it tries to pop two cards from the list. However, this single card might be able to beat a non-trump card that was not paired yet.

4. **Non-Exhaustive Pairing**: The program does not guarantee that all cards will be paired correctly. It might leave some cards unpaired or incorrectly paired, leading to an "IMPOSSIBLE" result when a valid pairing is possible.

Here is an example case where the program might fail:

**Input:**
```
1
2
C
3S 5C 9S 6H
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3S 5C
9S 6H
```

**Actual Output:**
```
IMPOSSIBLE
```

In this case, the program incorrectly determines that it is impossible to pair the cards, even though a valid pairing exists. The program should be able to correctly identify and pair the cards based on the rules provided.
