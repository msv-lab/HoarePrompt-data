Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, `trump` is the input character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}, and `cards` is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings where each string consists of a rank from '2' to '9' and a suit from 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is a dictionary with keys {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'} and each key has a value of `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, `trump` is the input character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}, and `cards` is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings where each string consists of a rank from '2' to '9' and a suit from 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing `rank`. Otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing a new string formed from the sorted rank and the suit value, concatenated with the `suit` character if `suits[suit]` was not `None`, and `suits[suit]` is now `None` if it was not `None`, otherwise `suits[suit]` is now `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump` is the input character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `cards` is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings where each string consists of a rank from '2' to '9' and a suit from 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'. `trumps` is a list containing the `rank` of the last card in `cards` if the `suit` of the last card is equal to `trump`; otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is a list containing a new string formed from the sorted rank and the suit value, concatenated with the `suit` character if `suits[suit]` was not `None`. If `suits[suit]` was not `None`, it is now `None`; otherwise, it is now `rank`. `card` is `cards[-1]`; `rank` is the rank of the last card in `cards`; `suit` is the suit of the last card in `cards`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump` is the input character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `cards` is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings where each string consists of a rank from '2' to '9' and a suit from 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'; `trumps` is a list containing the `rank` of the last card in `cards` if the `suit` of the last card is equal to `trump` and now also contains the `rank` of the next card in `cards` if the `suit` of the next card is equal to `trump`; otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list and now contains the `rank` of the next card in `cards`; `answers` is a list containing a new string formed from the sorted rank and the suit value, concatenated with the `suit` character if `suits[suit]` was not `None`. If `suits[suit]` was not `None`, it is now `None`; otherwise, it is now `rank`; `card` is the next card from the input string; `rank` is the rank of the next card in `cards`; `suit` is the suit of the next card in `cards`. If `suits[suit]` was not `None`, it is set to `None`; otherwise, it is set to `rank`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
