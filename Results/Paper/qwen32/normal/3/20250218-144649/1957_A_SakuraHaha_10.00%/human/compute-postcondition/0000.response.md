The code snippet provided reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of sticks available for a single test case. This does not affect the initial state of `t` (the number of test cases) or the lengths of the sticks `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The only variable that changes is `n`, as it is assigned the value of the next integer input.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks available, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. `n` is now the integer read from the input.**
