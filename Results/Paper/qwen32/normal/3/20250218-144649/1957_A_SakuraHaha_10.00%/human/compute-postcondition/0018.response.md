To determine what will be printed, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `ans` is calculated as the sum of integer divisions of each unique stick length count by 4.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged and are not directly involved in the calculation of `ans`.

Since the exact counts of unique stick lengths and their integer divisions by 4 are not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the formula given.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the unique stick lengths and their counts.
2. For each unique stick length count, perform an integer division by 4.
3. Sum all the results of these integer divisions to get `ans`.

Given that the exact counts of unique stick lengths are not specified, we can't compute a numerical value for `ans`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the provided information.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of integer divisions of each unique stick length count by 4)**
