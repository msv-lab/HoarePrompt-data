Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program only considers forming squares (4-sided polygons) from the sticks, as it divides the count of each stick length by 4. However, the problem description allows for forming any regular polygon, not just squares. For example, it should also consider forming triangles (3-sided polygons), pentagons (5-sided polygons), hexagons (6-sided polygons), etc.

Here's a counterexample:
```
Input:
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2

Output according to the program:
1

Expected Output:
2
```
In this case, the program can form only one square using 4 sticks of length 2. However, it can actually form two triangles using all 6 sticks. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
