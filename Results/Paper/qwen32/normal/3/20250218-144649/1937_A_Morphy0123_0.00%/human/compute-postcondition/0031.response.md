To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `n` and `power` evolve.

The loop condition is `while power < log2(n)`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `power` is less than the base-2 logarithm of `n`.

From the given output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `power` is 2, which means `log2(n)` must be at least 2, so `n` must be at least 4.
- After 2 iterations: `power` is 3, which means `log2(n)` must be at least 3, so `n` must be at least 8.
- After 3 iterations: `power` is 4, which means `log2(n)` must be at least 4, so `n` must be at least 16.

The loop increments `power` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, the loop will continue until `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`. This means that after the loop finishes, `power` will be equal to `floor(log2(n)) + 1`.

Given the pattern, if the loop executes all the iterations, `power` will eventually equal `floor(log2(n)) + 1`. Since the loop stops when `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`, the final value of `power` will be `floor(log2(n)) + 1`.

For the sake of a concrete example, let's assume `n` is such that `log2(n)` is an integer (e.g., `n` is a power of 2). If `n` is 16, then `log2(n)` is 4, and the loop will execute 4 times, setting `power` to 5. If `n` is not a power of 2, `power` will still be `floor(log2(n)) + 1` after the loop completes.

Thus, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is:
Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the input integer, `power` is `floor(log2(n)) + 1`.**

In simpler terms, `power` will be one more than the integer part of the base-2 logarithm of `n`.
