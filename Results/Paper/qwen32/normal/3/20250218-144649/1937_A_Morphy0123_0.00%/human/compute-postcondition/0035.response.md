The value of `power` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, `power` was originally `floor(log2(n)) + 1`. After the decrement, `power` becomes `floor(log2(n))`. The other variables (`n_cases` and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the input integer, `power` is `floor(log2(n))`.**
