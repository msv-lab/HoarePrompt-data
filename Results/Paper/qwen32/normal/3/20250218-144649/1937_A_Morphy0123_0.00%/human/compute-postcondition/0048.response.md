The value of `power` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `power` was 3, so now `power` is 4. The other variables (`n_cases`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` must be greater than 8, `i` is `i + 1`, `power` is 4**.
