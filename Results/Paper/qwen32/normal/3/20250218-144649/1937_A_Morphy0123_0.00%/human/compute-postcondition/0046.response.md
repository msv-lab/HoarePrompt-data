The value of `power` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `power` is 2, so after the operation, `power` becomes 3. The values of `n_cases`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is `i + 1`, `power` is 3**.
