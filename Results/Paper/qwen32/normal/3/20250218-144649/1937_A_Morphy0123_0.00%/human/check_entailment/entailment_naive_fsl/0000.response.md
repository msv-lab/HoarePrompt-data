Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the sequence of swap operations as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why the program is incorrect.

The program attempts to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n` and then prints `2 ** power`. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the sequence of swaps and determine the final position of 1.

Let's consider a few test cases to see the issue:

1. **Test Case: n = 4**
   - Initial array: [1, 2, 3, 4]
   - After swap(2): [2, 1, 3, 4]
   - After swap(3): [3, 1, 2, 4]
   - After swap(4): [3, 4, 2, 1]
   - The position of 1 is 4.

2. **Test Case: n = 5**
   - Initial array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   - After swap(2): [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
   - After swap(3): [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
   - After swap(4): [3, 4, 2, 1, 5]
   - After swap(5): [3, 4, 2, 1, 5]
   - The position of 1 is 4.

3. **Test Case: n = 120240229**
   - The program attempts to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 120240229, which is 2^26 = 67108864. However, this does not correctly simulate the sequence of swaps and determine the final position of 1.

The provided program does not simulate the swaps correctly and does not handle the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to simulate the swaps as described, keeping track of the position of 1 in the array after each swap.
