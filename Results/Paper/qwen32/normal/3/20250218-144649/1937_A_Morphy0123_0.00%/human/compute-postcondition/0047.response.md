To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is `while power < log2(n):`, so we need to ensure that the condition `power < log2(n)` holds true.

Here's the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `power` is 3.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `power` and/or `n` so that `power < log2(n)` remains true. Since `power` is currently 3, we need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 3. This means `n` must be greater than \(2^3 = 8\).

So, `n` must be greater than 8 to satisfy the condition `power < log2(n)`.

No other states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` must be greater than 8, `i` is `i + 1`, `power` is 3**
