The value of `power` is decremented by 1. The other variables, `n_cases` and `n`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the integer value of the input, and `power` is `floor(log2(n))`.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the integer value of the input, and `power` is `floor(log2(n))`.**
