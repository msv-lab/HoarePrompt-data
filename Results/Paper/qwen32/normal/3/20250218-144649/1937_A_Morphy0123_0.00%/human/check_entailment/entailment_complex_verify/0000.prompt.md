You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program: 
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which is the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), representing the length of the array a.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: i is equal to n_cases, n is the last input value processed, and n_cases remains unchanged. The program has printed the appropriate values for each input n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`. For each `n`, it prints the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is 1, it directly prints 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the sequence of swap operations as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why the program is incorrect.

The program attempts to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n` and then prints `2 ** power`. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the sequence of swaps and determine the final position of 1.

Let's consider a few test cases to see the issue:

1. **Test Case: n = 4**
   - Initial array: [1, 2, 3, 4]
   - After swap(2): [2, 1, 3, 4]
   - After swap(3): [3, 1, 2, 4]
   - After swap(4): [3, 4, 2, 1]
   - The position of 1 is 4.

2. **Test Case: n = 5**
   - Initial array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   - After swap(2): [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
   - After swap(3): [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
   - After swap(4): [3, 4, 2, 1, 5]
   - After swap(5): [3, 4, 2, 1, 5]
   - The position of 1 is 4.

3. **Test Case: n = 120240229**
   - The program attempts to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 120240229, which is 2^26 = 67108864. However, this does not correctly simulate the sequence of swaps and determine the final position of 1.

The provided program does not simulate the swaps correctly and does not handle the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to simulate the swaps as described, keeping track of the position of 1 in the array after each swap.
