To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition: `power` and `log2(n)`.

The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` must be at least 3. However, we need to ensure that `power` is still less than `log2(n)` for the loop to execute again.

1. **Current State:**
   - `power` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 3.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.
   - Since `power` is 2, we need `log2(n)` to be greater than 2.

3. **Determine `n`:**
   - If `log2(n) > 2`, then `n > 2^2`, which means `n > 4`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 5 to satisfy the condition `power < log2(n)`.

4. **Adjustments:**
   - `power` remains 2.
   - `n` must be adjusted to be at least 5.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` must be at least 5, `power` is 2**.
