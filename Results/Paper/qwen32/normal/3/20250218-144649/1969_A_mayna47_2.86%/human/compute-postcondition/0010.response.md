Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input. Additionally, `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`.**
