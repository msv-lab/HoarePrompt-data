The code snippet provided is:
```python
n = int(input())
```
This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. Since the value of `n` is being reassigned based on the input, the new value of `n` will be the integer provided by the user input.

The other variables `t` and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].**
