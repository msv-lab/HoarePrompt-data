Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
2. `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2.
3. `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`].
4. `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input.
5. The condition `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i` is checked, and if it equals `i`, the program returns without any value. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.
6. `i` is `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `2` and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, `v`, or `i`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not involve any variables or conditions that alter its output, the output will be the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
