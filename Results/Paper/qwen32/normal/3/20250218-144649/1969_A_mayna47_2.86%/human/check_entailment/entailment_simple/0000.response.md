### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the given code to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
1. **Objective**: Monocarp wants to throw a party with at least 2 friends. Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i` such that `p_i != i` and all `p_i` are distinct.
2. **Condition for Attendance**: Friend `i` will attend if both `i` and `p_i` receive invitations.
3. **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends attend.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of friends) and a list `p` of `n` integers representing the best friends.
2. **Logic**:
   - If `n == 2`, the program immediately prints `2` because both friends must be invited to attend.
   - For `n > 2`, the program checks if there exists a triplet `(i, p_i, p_{p_i})` such that `p_{p_{p_i}} = i`. If such a triplet is found, it prints `2` because inviting `i` and `p_i` will ensure that both `i` and `p_i` attend.
   - If no such triplet is found, the program prints `3` because it is guaranteed that inviting three friends will result in at least two attending.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case `n == 2`**: The program correctly handles this by printing `2` since both friends need to be invited.
- **Case `n > 2`**: The program checks for a triplet `(i, p_i, p_{p_i})` such that `p_{p_{p_i}} = i`. If such a triplet exists, inviting `i` and `p_i` ensures both attend. This is correct because it identifies a scenario where only two invitations are needed.
- **Fallback to `3` invitations**: If no such triplet is found, the program defaults to printing `3`. This is correct because, in the worst case, inviting three friends guarantees that at least two will attend since each friend can only have one best friend, and the structure of the problem ensures that inviting three friends will always result in at least two attending.

Thus, the logic and handling of the program are correct based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
