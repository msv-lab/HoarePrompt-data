Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements; `a` is the next element in `inp` after the previous value of `a`; `x` has some value; `y` is equal to `a`. If `a` is less than or equal to the previous value of `y`, `ans` has some value. If `a` is greater than the previous value of `y`, `ans` has been incremented by 1.**
