Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is greater than `x`. The current value of `a` is equal to `y`.**

In simple terms, the value of `y` is updated to be equal to `a`. All other variables retain their original values.
