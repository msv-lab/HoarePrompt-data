The provided code snippet `x == y` is a comparison operation that checks if `x` is equal to `y`. However, it does not assign the result to any variable or modify any existing variables. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, `inp`, `ans`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is greater than `x`. Additionally, `a` is greater than `y`.**
