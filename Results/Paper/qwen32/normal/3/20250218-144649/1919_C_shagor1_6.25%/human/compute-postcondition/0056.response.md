The code snippet `y = a` changes the value of `y` to the value of `a`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `x` is `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` remains `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the next element in `inp`.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `x` is `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` remains `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the next element in `inp`.**
