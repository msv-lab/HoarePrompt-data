Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements; `a` is the next element in `inp` after the previous value of `a`; `x` has some value; `y` is equal to `a`; `ans` has been incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` has been increased by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `inp`, `a`, and `x`) retain their previous values. The variable `y` is still equal to `a`.
