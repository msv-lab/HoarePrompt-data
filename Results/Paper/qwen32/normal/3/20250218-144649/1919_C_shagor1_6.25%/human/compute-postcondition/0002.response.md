The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns these integers to the variable `inp` as a list. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
