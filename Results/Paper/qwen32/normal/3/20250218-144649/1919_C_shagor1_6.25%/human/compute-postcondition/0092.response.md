The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by 1. The other variables (`inp`, `n`, `a`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the next integer in `inp`, `y` is equal to `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The list `inp` still contains the same integers, `n` remains the same input integer, `a` still holds the next integer from `inp`, `y` is still equal to `a`, and `ans` has been increased by 1.
