To determine what will be printed, let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state:

1. **Identify the variables and their meanings:**
   - `x` is the smallest element in the list `inp`.
   - `y` is the second smallest element in the list `inp`.
   - `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

2. **Understand the computation of `ans`:**
   - First, `x` and `y` are identified by sorting `inp` and picking the smallest and second smallest elements.
   - Then, `ans` is calculated by counting how many elements in `inp` are greater than both `x` and `y`.

3. **Formulate the output:**
   - The print statement `print(ans)` will output the value of `ans`.

Since the exact list `inp` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

**Output Description:**
The `print(ans)` statement will print the count of elements in the list `inp` that are greater than both the smallest element `x` and the second smallest element `y` in the list `inp`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both the smallest element `x` and the second smallest element `y` in the list `inp`)**
