Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element. If `a` is less than or equal to `x` (which is `n + 1`), then `x` remains `a` and `y` is `n + 1`. Otherwise, `x` is `n + 1` and `y` is `a`. If `a` is greater than `x` and `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `ans` is `0`. If `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`, then `ans` is `1`.**
