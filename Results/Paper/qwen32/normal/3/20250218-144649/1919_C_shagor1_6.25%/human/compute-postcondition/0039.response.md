The value of `ans` is reset to 0 by the code snippet. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `inp` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `n + 1`; `ans` is 0; `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `n + 1`; `ans` is 0; `n` is an input integer.**
