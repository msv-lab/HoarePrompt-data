Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `x` is `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` remains `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 2; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the next element in `inp`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
