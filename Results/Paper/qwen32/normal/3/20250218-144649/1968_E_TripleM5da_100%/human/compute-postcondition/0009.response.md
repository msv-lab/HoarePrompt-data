Based on the initial state provided:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, but `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly set to 6.
- `n` must be at least 6, but `n` is also not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly set to 6, the print statement will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **6, 6**
