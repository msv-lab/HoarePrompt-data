To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change.

The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = n` (inclusive). Each iteration prints the current value of `i` twice.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer

The loop header is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`, which means `i` will take on values from 3 to `n` inclusive.

After the loop finishes, `i` will be one more than the last value it took, which is `n + 1`. The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is not modified in the loop body.

Thus, after all iterations, the final state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50
- `i` will be `n + 1`
- `n` remains the input integer

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, i is n + 1, n is an input integer.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` stays the same, `i` becomes `n + 1`, and `n` remains unchanged.
