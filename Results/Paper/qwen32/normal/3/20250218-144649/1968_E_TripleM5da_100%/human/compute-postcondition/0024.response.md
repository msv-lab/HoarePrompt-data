Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is defined as `n + 1`, where `n` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, 1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(1, 1)`, which directly prints the integers 1 and 1, separated by a space. 

- The variables `t` and `i` are defined based on the input `n`, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, or `n`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the numbers 1 and 1, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, or `n`.

### Output:
Output: **1 1**
