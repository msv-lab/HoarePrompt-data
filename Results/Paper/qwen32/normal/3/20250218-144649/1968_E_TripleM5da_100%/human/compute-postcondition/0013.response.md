The given initial state describes the variables `t`, `i`, and `n`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the numbers 1 and 1.

Let's break down the provided information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an input integer.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, 1)
```

Since the print statement is explicitly printing the numbers 1 and 1, the values of `t`, `i`, and `n` do not affect the output of this statement.

Output: **1, 1**
