Reasoning:
The provided program aims to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. However, the program's output does not seem to achieve this goal for all values of \(n\).

Let's analyze the provided program and the expected behavior:
- The program starts by printing the points (1, 1) and (1, 2) for each test case.
- Then, it prints the points (i, i) for each i from 3 to n.

This strategy does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. For example:
- For \(n = 3\), the program outputs (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), but the optimal solution can yield \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
- For \(n = 4\), the program outputs (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), but the optimal solution can yield \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).

The optimal strategy involves placing points in such a way that the Manhattan distances between them are as distinct as possible, which the current program does not achieve.

Thus, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
