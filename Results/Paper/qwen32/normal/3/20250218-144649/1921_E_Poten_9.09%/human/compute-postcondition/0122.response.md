The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is `i`, and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The variable `test_cases` determines the number of iterations the loop will run. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0
- `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `i` is incremented by 1 (unchanged in this code snippet)

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `test_cases` remains unchanged as it is the total number of iterations.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise:
- If `i` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, after the first iteration, `i` would be 1.
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 2, and so on.

So, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 4**.
