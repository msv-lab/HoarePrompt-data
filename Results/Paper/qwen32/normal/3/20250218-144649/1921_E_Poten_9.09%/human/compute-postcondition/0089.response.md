The code snippet appends the string `'Bob'` to the `answers` list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 (unchanged in this code snippet), `answers` list has an additional element `'Bob'` appended to it.**
