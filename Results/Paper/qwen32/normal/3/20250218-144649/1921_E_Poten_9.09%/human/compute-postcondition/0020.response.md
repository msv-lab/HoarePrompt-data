The code snippet appends the string `'Draw'` to the `answers` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2] <= clues[4]`, and `clues[0] != 1`. Additionally, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and the current value of `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`. The absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less. The current value of `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2`.**
