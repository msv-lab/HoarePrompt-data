Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` which represent the dimensions of a rectangle and the coordinates of two distinct points within it. The function returns a value indicating whether the two points are in the same quadrant of the rectangle or not, based on the given constraints.**
