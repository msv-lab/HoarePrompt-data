The code snippet appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 (unchanged in this code snippet), `answers` is a list containing the string `'Bob'`.**
