In the given initial state, we have the following information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is set to the value of `t` and is greater than 0.
- `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `i` is set to the value of `t`.
- `answers` is a list containing more than one element.

However, there is no mention of the variable `j` in the initial state or in the provided code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine the value of `j` based on the given information.

Since the variable `j` is not defined in the initial state, the print statement will result in a `NameError` because `j` is not recognized in the current scope.

Output: **NameError: name 'j' is not defined**
