To determine the necessary state adjustments for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head here is `for i in range(test_cases):`, which means the variables `i` and `test_cases` are the ones we can adjust.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is an integer equal to the value of `t` read from the input.
- `answers` is an empty list.

The loop will execute if `test_cases` is at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop index and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts. Therefore, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0**.

However, since `i` is automatically initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, we don't need to explicitly state it in the initial conditions. Thus, the final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list**.
