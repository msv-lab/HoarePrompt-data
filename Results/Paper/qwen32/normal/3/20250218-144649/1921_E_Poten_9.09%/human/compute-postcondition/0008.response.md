Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2] <= clues[4]`, `clues[0] != 1`, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, and `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`.**
