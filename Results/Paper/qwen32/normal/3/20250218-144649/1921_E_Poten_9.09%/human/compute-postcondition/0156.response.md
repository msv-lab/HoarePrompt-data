Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 4. If `clues[5] - 2 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'`. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Alice'`.**
