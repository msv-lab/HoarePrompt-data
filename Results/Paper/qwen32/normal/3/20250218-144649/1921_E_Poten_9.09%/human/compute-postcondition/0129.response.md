The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 4, and `answers` is a list that now includes the string `'Draw'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 4, `answers` is a list that includes the string `'Draw'`**.
