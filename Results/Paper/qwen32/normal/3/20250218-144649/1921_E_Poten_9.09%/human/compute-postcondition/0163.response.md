Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is equal to `t`, and `answers` is a list containing the results of `t` iterations based on the provided conditions.**

In human-readable terms, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the state is such that:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `test_cases` is equal to `t`, indicating the number of test cases processed.
- `clues` holds the most recent list of integers obtained from the input for the final iteration.
- `i` equals `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- `answers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result ('Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob') determined by the conditions specified in the loop for each corresponding test case.
