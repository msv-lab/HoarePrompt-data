Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `clues[2] <= clues[4]` and `clues[0] != 1`. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, `answers` contains 'Bob' if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 with specific conditions met, otherwise it contains 'Draw'. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are not both even or both odd, `answers` contains 'Alice' unless `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]` or specific conditions for 'Draw' are met.**
