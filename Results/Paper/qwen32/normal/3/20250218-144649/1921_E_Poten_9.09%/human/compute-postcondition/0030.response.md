Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2]` <= `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` != 1, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, the current value of `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. Additionally, `clues[1] - clues[3] < abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` and `clues[3] - clues[5] < abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`**
