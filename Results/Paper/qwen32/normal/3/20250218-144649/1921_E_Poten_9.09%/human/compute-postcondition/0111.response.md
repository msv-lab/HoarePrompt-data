Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 (unchanged in this code snippet), `answers` contains the string 'Alice'**.

In natural language: The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The variable `test_cases` is still equal to `t` and is greater than 0. The list `clues` retains its previous value as a list of integers obtained from the input. The variable `i` has not changed since it is mentioned as incremented by 1 but is unchanged in this context. The list `answers` now includes the string 'Alice'.
