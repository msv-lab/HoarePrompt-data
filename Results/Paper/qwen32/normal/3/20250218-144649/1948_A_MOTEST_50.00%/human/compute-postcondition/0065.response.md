The provided code snippet only contains a `print('YES')` statement. This means that regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `ans`, `j`, and `i` as described in the initial state, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'YES'`.

Here's a breakdown of the given initial state and how it relates to the `print` statement:

- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` is another input integer.
- `x` is calculated as `n // 2`.
- Depending on whether `n` is even or odd (and greater than or equal to 3), `ans` and `j` are defined differently.
- If `n` is not equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print('YES')` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
