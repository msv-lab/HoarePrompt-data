The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 2, the character at index 2 of `s` is repeated twice and appended to `ans`.

Initial State:
- `t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50)
- `n` must be at least 8
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice
- `x` is 2
- `j` is 3

After the code executes, `ans` will be updated to include the character at index 2 of `s` repeated twice.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` must be at least 8; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice and then the third character of `s` repeated twice; `x` is 2; `j` is 3.**
