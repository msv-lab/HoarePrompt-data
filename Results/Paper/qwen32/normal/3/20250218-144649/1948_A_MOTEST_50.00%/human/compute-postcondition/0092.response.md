Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an odd integer and must be at least 5; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is `'AAA' + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2 + s[3] * 2`; `x` is 3; `j` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by appending `s[3] * 2` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.
