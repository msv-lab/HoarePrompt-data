The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `x` is 2, after the operation, `x` becomes 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ans`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is at least 4; `x` is 3; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice and then the character at index 2 of `s` repeated twice; `j` is 2**.
