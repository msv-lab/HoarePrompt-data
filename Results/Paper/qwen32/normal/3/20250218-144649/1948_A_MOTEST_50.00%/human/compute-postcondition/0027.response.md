The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends `s[x]` repeated twice to the current value of `ans`. Given the initial state, `x` is 2, so `s[x]` is `s[2]`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `'AAA' + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2`.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is odd, `n` must be at least 5; `ans` is `'AAA' + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2`; `x` is 2; `j` is 1.**
