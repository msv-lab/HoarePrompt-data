To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop and the provided output states after the first three iterations.

Here's the loop:
```python
for j in range(n // 2):
    ans += s[x] * 2
    x += 1
```

Given:
- `t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50).
- `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is even.
- `ans` is an empty string initially.
- `x` is 0 initially.
- `s` is undefined in the context of the provided information, but it's a string from which characters are taken.

The loop runs `n // 2` times. After three iterations, `x` is 3, and `ans` contains `s[x] * 6`. This implies `n // 2` must be at least 3, so `n` must be at least 6.

After the loop completes all iterations:
- The loop runs `n // 2` times, so `x` will be `n // 2`.
- `ans` will be the concatenation of `s[0] * 2`, `s[1] * 2`, ..., `s[(n // 2) - 1] * 2`.

Thus, the final state of `ans` will be a string that contains the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice.

Let's summarize the final output state:
- `t` remains the same (1 <= `t` <= 50).
- `n` remains the same (even and not equal to 1).
- `ans` will be the concatenation of `s[0] * 2`, `s[1] * 2`, ..., `s[(n // 2) - 1] * 2`.
- `x` will be `n // 2`.
- `s` is undefined in the provided context.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is even; `ans` is a string containing `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2 + ... + s[(n // 2) - 1] * 2`; `x` is `n // 2`; `s` is undefined.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, `ans` will contain the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice, and `x` will be `n // 2`.
