The code snippet appends two occurrences of the character at index `x` in the string `s` to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 1, `ans` will now include the character at index 1 of `s` repeated twice.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is at least 2; `x` is 1; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice; `j` is 1.**
