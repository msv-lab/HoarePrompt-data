Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is the input integer; `x` is `n // 2`. If `n` is even, `ans` is the concatenation of the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, each repeated twice, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is `'AAA' + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2 + ... + s[n // 2 - 1] * 2`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`. If `n` is not equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`.**
