The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Initially, `x` was 2, so after the operation, `x` becomes 3. Other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is greater than 4; `ans` is a string containing `s[x] * 6`; `x` is 3; `s` is undefined; `j` is 2.**
