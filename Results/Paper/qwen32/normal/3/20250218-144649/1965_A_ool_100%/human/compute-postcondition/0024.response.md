Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `A` is True if the number of iterations is odd and the loop does not break early, otherwise `A` is False. `set_` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with the first element being 1. `not_c` is True, meaning that no difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1. `i` is `len(set_) - 1` unless the loop breaks early.**
