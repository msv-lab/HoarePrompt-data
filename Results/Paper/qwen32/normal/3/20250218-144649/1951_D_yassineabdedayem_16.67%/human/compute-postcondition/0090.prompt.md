Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0; `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0; `tab` is `[]`; `Min` is 2; `Max` is 5. If `k` is 0, the sequence 2 5 2 is executed. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0; `n` is `n - Min * Max`; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0; `n` is `n - Min * Max`; `k` is an integer greater than 0 and updated to `k - Min` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`, otherwise `k` is an integer less than or equal to 0; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Max` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`, otherwise `number` is `Min`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0; `n` is a positive value equal to the previous `n` minus `Min * Max`; `k` is either `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, or `k - Min` otherwise; `rep` is 3; `tab` is a list containing three string representations of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
