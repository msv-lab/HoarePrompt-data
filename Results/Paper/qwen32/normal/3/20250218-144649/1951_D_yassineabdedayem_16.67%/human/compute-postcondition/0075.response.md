The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given that `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, the relationships between `n`, `k`, `Min`, and `Max` are preserved. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than `Min * Max + k`; `k` is an integer greater than 0 and updated to `k - Min`; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `Max`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Max`.**
