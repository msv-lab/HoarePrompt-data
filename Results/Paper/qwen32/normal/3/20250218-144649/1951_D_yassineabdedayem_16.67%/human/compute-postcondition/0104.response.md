Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is a non-negative integer; `k` is a non-positive integer or 0; `rep` is an integer between 0 and 60; `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated. If `k` is 0, all elements of `tab` have been printed separated by spaces.**
