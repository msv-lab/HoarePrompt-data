To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how the variables change with each iteration. Here is the loop:

```python
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(n // k, k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1
```

### Analysis of the Loop:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0)
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input
   - `rep` is 0
   - `tab` is an empty list
   - `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated
   - `number` is 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - `Min` and `Max` are calculated as `min(n // k, k)` and `max(n // k, k)` respectively.
   - Depending on the condition `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, `number` is set to `Min` or `Max`, and `k` is adjusted accordingly.
   - `tab` is updated with the string representation of `number`.
   - `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`.
   - `rep` is incremented by 1.

4. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when `n` becomes 0, `k` becomes 0, `rep` reaches 60, or `n` is less than `k`.

### Final Output State:

The loop continues until one of the conditions in the while statement fails. Given the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can generalize the final state based on the loop's behavior:

- `t` remains `t - 1` (as it is not modified within the loop).
- `n` will be 0 when the loop terminates (since `n` is reduced by `Min * Max` in each iteration until it can no longer satisfy `n >= k`).
- `k` will be 0 or a positive integer less than `n` (depending on the specific values and the number of iterations).
- `rep` will be the number of iterations the loop ran, which can be up to 60 if the loop does not terminate earlier.
- `tab` will contain a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration.
- `Min` and `Max` will be the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.
- `number` will be the last computed value in the loop.

### Conclusion:

The final output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is 0; `k` is a positive integer or 0; `rep` is the number of iterations the loop ran (up to 60); `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated; `number` is the last computed value in the loop.**

In simple terms, the loop runs until `n` becomes 0 or `k` becomes 0 or the maximum number of iterations (60) is reached. The variables `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` are updated accordingly during each iteration.
