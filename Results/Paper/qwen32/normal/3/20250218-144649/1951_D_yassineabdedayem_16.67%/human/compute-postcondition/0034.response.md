Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be 2 or greater; `rep` is 2; `number` is 2; `tab` is either `['2', '1']` or `['2', '3']`; `Min` is 1; `Max` is 2; `k` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 1 by subtracting `Min` (which is 1) from its previous value (which is 2). All other variables retain their initial values.
