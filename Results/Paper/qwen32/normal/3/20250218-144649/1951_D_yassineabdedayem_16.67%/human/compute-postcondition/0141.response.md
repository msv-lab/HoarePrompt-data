The code snippet increments the variable `rep` by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `rep` changes from 2 to 3, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must still be greater than 0; `n` is the original value of `n` minus `Min * Max` and `n - Min * Max >= k`; `k` is `k - Max` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is `k - Min` (and `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n - Min * Max`); `rep` is 3; `tab` is a list containing three elements `str(number)`, `str(number)`, `str(number)`; `Min` is `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int((n - Min * Max) / k), k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and (n - Min * Max) * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**
