The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`. Given that `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, the new value of `k` will be less than or equal to 0 because `Max` is at least `k` and could be larger. This change affects the value of `k` but does not affect the other variables directly.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than `Min * Max + k`; `k` is an integer less than or equal to 0; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Min`.**
