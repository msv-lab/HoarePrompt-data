The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `tab`. According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the list `tab` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` must have at least one element, and `i` is currently set to the last element of `tab`.

To execute one more time, `tab` must have another element after the last one that was processed. Therefore, `tab` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be set to the next element in the list.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer (possibly 0), `k` is 0, `rep` is an integer between 0 and 60, `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration and must have at least two elements, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated**
