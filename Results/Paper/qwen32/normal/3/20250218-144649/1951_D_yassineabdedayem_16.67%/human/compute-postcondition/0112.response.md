Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is a positive integer; `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n`; `rep` is 0; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`; `number` is 0; `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`**
