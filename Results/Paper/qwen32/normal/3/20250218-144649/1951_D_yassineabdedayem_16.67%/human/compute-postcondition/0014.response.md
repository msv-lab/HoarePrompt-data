Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 10; `k` is 3; `rep` is 0; `number` is 5; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is 2; `Max` is 5; either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

In this output state, `k` has been updated to 3 (since `k = k - Min` and `k` was 5, `Min` was 2). All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `either Max is not equal to k or n * Min is greater than k` is still valid because `Max` (5) is not equal to the new `k` (3).
