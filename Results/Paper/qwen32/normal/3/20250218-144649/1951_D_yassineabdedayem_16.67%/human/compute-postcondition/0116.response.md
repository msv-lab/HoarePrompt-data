Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is a positive integer; `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n`; `rep` is 0; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`; `number` is `Max`; it is not the case that `Max == k and n * Min <= k`**

Natural Language: The value of `number` has been updated to `Max`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
