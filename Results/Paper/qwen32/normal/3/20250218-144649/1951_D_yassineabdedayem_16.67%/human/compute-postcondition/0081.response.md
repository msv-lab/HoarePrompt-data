The code snippet updates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the expressions provided. The initial state specifies that `Min` and `Max` are already defined as `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` respectively. However, the code reassigns these variables with the same expressions, which means their values will remain the same unless there was an error in the initial state or the values of `n` or `k` have changed in a way that affects these calculations.

Given that the expressions for `Min` and `Max` are the same as in the initial state, the values of `Min` and `Max` will not change. Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state with respect to `Min` and `Max`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is such that `n - Min * Max` is greater than 0; `k` is such that `k - Min` is greater than 0 if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Max` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`, otherwise `number` is `Min`**.
