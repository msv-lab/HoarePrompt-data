Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: It is mentioned as `t - 1` and still greater than 0. This implies `t` was decremented by 1 but is still positive.
2. **`n`**: It is initialized to 0.
3. **`k`**: It is initialized to 0.
4. **`rep`**: This variable represents the number of iterations the loop ran, up to a maximum of 60.
5. **`tab`**: This is a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration. It is mentioned that `tab` must have at least two elements.
6. **`Min` and `Max`**: These are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.
7. **`number`**: This is the last computed value in the loop.
8. **Current value of `k`**: It is 0.
9. **`i`**: This is described as the next element in `tab`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is printing the variable `i`.
- `i` is described as the next element in `tab`.

Since `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration, and `i` is the next element in `tab`, the print statement will output the next element in the `tab` list.

Given that `tab` must have at least two elements, and `i` is the next element in `tab`, the output will be the string representation of the number computed in the second iteration of the loop (since `tab` has at least two elements, the first element being the result of the first iteration and `i` being the result of the second iteration).

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string representation of the number computed in the second iteration of the loop, which is stored in the `tab` list.

Output: **[second element of tab] (where the second element of tab is the string representation of the number computed in the second iteration of the loop)**
