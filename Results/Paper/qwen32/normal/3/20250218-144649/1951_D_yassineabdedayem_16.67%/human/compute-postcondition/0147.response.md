To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and see if we can infer the value of `i`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: It is mentioned as `t - 1` and still greater than 0. This suggests that `t` is a counter or loop control variable that is being decremented in each iteration of a loop.
2. **`n`**: It is initialized to 0.
3. **`k`**: It is initialized to 0.
4. **`rep`**: It is the number of iterations the loop ran, up to a maximum of 60.
5. **`tab`**: It is a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration and must have at least one element.
6. **`Min` and `Max`**: These are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.
7. **`number`**: This is the last computed value in the loop.
8. **Current `k` value**: It is explicitly stated to be 0.

### The Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(i, end=' ')`, which means it will print the value of `i` followed by a space, rather than a newline.

### Analyzing the Value of `i`:
- The variable `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. This means `i` must be defined within the context of the loop or some other part of the code that is not provided.
- Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value from the given information. However, based on common loop structures, `i` is often used as an index or a counter in loops.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` because it is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is that `i` is some value that is being printed, and its exact value is not specified by the initial state.

Output: **i (where i is the value of the variable i, which is not specified in the initial state)**
