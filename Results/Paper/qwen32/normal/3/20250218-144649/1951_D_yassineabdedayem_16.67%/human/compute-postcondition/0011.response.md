The code snippet `k = k - Max` subtracts the value of `Max` from `k`. Given the initial state, `k` is 5 and `Max` is also 5. Therefore, `k` becomes 0 after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 10; `k` is 0; `rep` is 0; `number` is 2; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is 2; `Max` is 5; `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Note: The condition `Max equals k` is no longer valid since `k` is now 0 and `Max` is 5. The condition `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k` is also no longer valid since `n * Min` is 20 and `k` is 0. However, these conditions were part of the initial state description and are not affected by the code execution itself, so they are kept in the output state.
