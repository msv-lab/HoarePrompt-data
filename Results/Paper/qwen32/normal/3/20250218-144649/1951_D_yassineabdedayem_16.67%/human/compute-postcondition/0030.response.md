Given the initial conditions and the code snippet, we will calculate the new values of `Min` and `Max`:

- `n // k` is calculated as `2 // 2`, which equals `1`.
- `int(n / k)` is calculated as `int(2 / 2)`, which also equals `1`.
- `k` is `2`.

Now, applying these to the `min` and `max` functions:
- `Min` will be `min(1, 2)`, which equals `1`.
- `Max` will be `max(1, 2)`, which equals `2`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be 2 or greater; `rep` is 2; `number` is either 1 or 3; `tab` is either `['2', '1']` or `['2', '3']`; `Min` is 1; `Max` is 2; `k` is 2.**
