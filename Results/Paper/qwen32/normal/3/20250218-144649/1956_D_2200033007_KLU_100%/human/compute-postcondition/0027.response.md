The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `start_index`, and `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `start_index` and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have taken all values from `start_index` to `start_index + i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be adjusted to the starting value of the next iteration, which is `start_index`.

Since `i` and `start_index` do not change within the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop. The variable `j` needs to be set to `start_index` to start the next iteration.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[j]` is `i`, `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, `j` is `start_index`**
