### Reasoning:

Let's carefully examine the provided code and function summaries to assess its correctness based on the problem description. We will focus on the logic and correctness of the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs`.

#### Function 1: `func_1(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> int`
- **Purpose**: Computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` after performing the allowed operations.
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses memoization (`res_dict`) to store results of subproblems.
  - Considers different ways to split the subarray and calculates the potential maximum sum.
  - Checks if filling the entire subarray with the maximum possible MEX value (`(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2`) is optimal.
  - Explores splitting the subarray at each possible position and calculates the sum recursively.
  - Considers extending the subarray by including the first or last element and calculating the sum recursively.
- **Issues**:
  - The logic for computing the MEX value and filling the subarray is not entirely clear. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not necessarily `(end_index - start_index + 1)`.
  - The recursive splitting and summing logic seems correct in principle but might not cover all edge cases.

#### Function 2: `func_2(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]`
- **Purpose**: Generates the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum as computed by `func_1`.
- **Implementation**:
  - Recursively constructs the sequence of operations by examining the same splits and conditions as `func_1`.
  - Calls `make_stairs` to fill the subarray with the MEX values when the optimal solution involves filling the entire subarray.
- **Issues**:
  - The logic for constructing the sequence of operations is not fully correct. It does not handle all cases correctly, especially when the optimal solution involves splitting the subarray.
  - The function `make_stairs` is not correctly called or used to generate the sequence of operations.

#### Function 3: `make_stairs(i: int) -> None`
- **Purpose**: Fills a subarray with the MEX values from 0 to `i`.
- **Implementation**:
  - Checks if the subarray is already in the desired MEX form.
  - If not, recursively fills the subarray by performing the necessary operations and updating the array.
- **Issues**:
  - The variable `start_index` is used but not defined within the function. It should be passed as a parameter.
  - The function does not correctly handle the case when the subarray is not already in the desired MEX form.

### Global Variables and Scope
- The variable `arr` is used in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs`, but it is not defined within these functions. It should be passed as a parameter or defined globally.
- The variable `res` is used in `func_2` and `make_stairs`, but it is not defined within these functions. It should be passed as a parameter or defined globally.

### Handling Edge Cases
- The code does not handle edge cases such as when the array is already in the optimal form or when the array has only one element.

### Conclusion
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code is not correct. It does not handle all cases correctly and lacks proper handling of global variables and scope. The logic for computing the MEX value and filling the subarray is not entirely clear and might not cover all edge cases.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying these issues. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
