The code snippet provided is a function call `make_stairs(i - 1)`. This means the function `make_stairs` is being called with the argument `i - 1`. However, the function `make_stairs` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine the exact changes it will make to the variables.

Given the information, the only certainty is that the function `make_stairs` will be executed with the argument `i - 1`. Since the function is not defined, we can assume that the variables `i`, `start_index`, `arr`, and `is_already_stairs` might be modified by the function, but we do not have details on how they are modified.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`, but the specific values of the variables will remain as provided unless the function `make_stairs` modifies them.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. The current value of `arr[start_index + i]` is `i`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**
