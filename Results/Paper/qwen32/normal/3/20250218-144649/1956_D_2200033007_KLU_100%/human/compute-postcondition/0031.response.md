Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[j]` is `i` for all `j` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i`, `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the list `arr` will have the value `i` assigned to each element from index `start_index` to `start_index + i`. All other elements of `arr` that are not in this range will retain their previous values. The variable `is_already_stairs` remains False, and the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` is included in the list `res`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has already been called, and the condition `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i` still holds true.
