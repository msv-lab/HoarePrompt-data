### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions in the context of the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum for a subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index` through a recursive approach.
   - It considers three main cases:
     - When the subarray consists of a single element, it returns the maximum of 1 and the value of that element.
     - When the subarray length is greater than 1, it calculates the maximum sum by:
       - Considering the square of the subarray length.
       - Recursively calculating the sum for subranges and combining them.
       - Including the values of the boundary elements (`arr[start_index]` and `arr[end_index]`) and recursively calculating the sum for the remaining subarrays.
   - The results are stored in a dictionary `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - This function seems to be correctly calculating the maximum possible sum for a given subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It handles different scenarios:
     - When the subarray length is 1, it checks if the single element is non-positive and returns the appropriate operation or an empty list.
     - When the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` and returns the corresponding operation.
     - Otherwise, it recursively determines the subarrays that contribute to the maximum sum and combines the results from these subarrays.
   - This function seems to be correctly constructing the sequence of operations.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function modifies the array to form a "staircase" pattern from `start_index` to `start_index + i` and appends the corresponding operations to a list `res`.
   - It checks if the subarray already forms a staircase pattern. If not, it modifies the subarray and appends the operations.
   - This function seems to be correctly modifying the array and recording the operations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided execution summaries and the code analysis, it appears that the functions together correctly calculate the maximum possible sum and construct the sequence of operations needed to achieve this sum. The functions handle all specified scenarios and constraints correctly.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
