The code snippet `arr[j] = i` modifies the value of the element at index `j` in the list `arr` to be `i`. Given the initial state, `j` is equal to `start_index`, so the element at `arr[start_index]` is set to `i`.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[start_index]` is now `i` and `arr[j]` for `j != start_index` retains its previous value, `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, `j` is `start_index`**
