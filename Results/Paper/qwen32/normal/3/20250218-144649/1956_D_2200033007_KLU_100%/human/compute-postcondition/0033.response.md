Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, `arr[j]` is `i` for all `j` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i`, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, and `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` and the results of `make_stairs(i - 1)`.**
