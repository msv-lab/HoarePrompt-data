The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`. Since `i` is currently equal to `t`, the loop cannot execute again with the current state. However, if we were to adjust the state to simulate the start of the next iteration, `i` would need to be incremented by 1 if it were less than `t`. Since `i` is already equal to `t`, we need to consider the previous iteration where `i` was `t-1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration (which would be the current iteration if `i` were less than `t`), `i` should be `t-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the integer input by the user. If `n` is 3, `j` remains unchanged from its previous definition or is undefined if it wasn't defined before. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`.**
