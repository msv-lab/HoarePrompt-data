The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print('2 3')`. This statement will output the string `'2 3'` exactly as it is written, without considering the values of any variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`) defined in the initial state. The values of these variables do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the string to be printed is hardcoded.

Output: **2 3**
