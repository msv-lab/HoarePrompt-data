Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `i` is set to the value of `t`.
- `n` must be at least 5.
- `j` is set to the value 5.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `j` is explicitly given the value 5.
- The print statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and the string representation of `j` again.
- Since `j` is 5, `str(j)` will be the string "5".
- Therefore, the expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` evaluates to `"5" + " " + "5"`, which is `"5 5"`.

### Output:
Output: **5 5**
