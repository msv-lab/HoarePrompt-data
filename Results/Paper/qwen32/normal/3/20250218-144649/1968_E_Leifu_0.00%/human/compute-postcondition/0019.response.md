The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'1 1'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `j`) and their relationships, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the values of these variables do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
2. The variable `i` is set to the value of `t`.
3. The variable `n` is the integer input by the user.
4. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, then `j` is set to `n` + 1.
5. If `n` is 3, the value of `j` remains unchanged from its previous definition, or it is undefined if it wasn't defined before.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('1 1')
```
This statement directly prints the string `'1 1'` to the console, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **1 1**
