You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. It then prints a series of pairs of integers based on the value of `n`. Specifically, it prints '1 1', '1 2', and either '2 3' if `n` is 3, or '2 4' followed by pairs 'j j' for each `j` from 4 to `n` if `n` is greater than 3.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Here are a few specific issues:

1. **For \(n = 2\)**: The program outputs `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. The Manhattan distances are `|1-1| + |1-1| = 0` and `|1-1| + |2-1| = 1`, resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\). This is correct for \(n = 2\).

2. **For \(n = 3\)**: The program outputs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`. The Manhattan distances are:
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 3)`: `|1-2| + |1-3| = 3`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 3)`: `|1-2| + |2-3| = 2`
   - Resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). This is correct for \(n = 3\).

3. **For \(n = 4\)**: The program outputs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(4, 4)`. The Manhattan distances are:
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: `|1-2| + |1-4| = 4`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: `|1-4| + |1-4| = 6`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: `|1-2| + |2-4| = 3`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`: `|1-4| + |2-4| = 5`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: `|2-4| + |4-4| = 2`
   - Resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). This is correct for \(n = 4\).

4. **For \(n = 5\)**: The program outputs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, and `(5, 5)`. The Manhattan distances are:
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: `|1-2| + |1-4| = 4`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: `|1-4| + |1-4| = 6`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(5, 5)`: `|1-5| + |1-5| = 8`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: `|1-2| + |2-4| = 3`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`: `|1-4| + |2-4| = 5`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(5, 5)`: `|1-5| + |2-5| = 7`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: `|2-4| + |4-4| = 2`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(5, 5)`: `|2-5| + |4-5| = 4`
   - Between `(4, 4)` and `(5, 5)`: `|4-5| + |4-5| = 2`
   - Resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\). This is correct for \(n = 5\).

5. **For \(n = 6\)**: The program outputs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, and `(6, 1)`. The Manhattan distances are:
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: `|1-2| + |1-4| = 4`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: `|1-4| + |1-4| = 6`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(5, 5)`: `|1-5| + |1-5| = 8`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(6, 1)`: `|1-6| + |1-1| = 5`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: `|1-2| + |2-4| = 3`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`: `|1-4| + |2-4| = 5`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(5, 5)`: `|1-5| + |2-5| = 7`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(6, 1)`: `|1-6| + |2-1| = 6`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: `|2-4| + |4-4| = 2`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(5, 5)`: `|2-5| + |4-5| = 4`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(6, 1)`: `|2-6| + |4-1| = 7`
   - Between `(4, 4)` and `(5, 5)`: `|4-5| + |4-5| = 2`
   - Between `(4, 4)` and `(6, 1)`: `|4-6| + |4-1| = 5`
   - Between `(5, 5)` and `(6, 1)`: `|5-6| + |5-1| = 5`
   - Resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\). This is correct for \(n = 6\).

However, the program does not generalize correctly for all \(n\). For example, for \(n = 7\), the program would output `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, `(6, 1)`, and `(7, 7)`. The Manhattan distances do not cover all possible distinct distances, and thus, the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is not maximized.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide a general solution that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).
