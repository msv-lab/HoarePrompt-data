Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Here are a few specific issues:

1. **For \(n = 2\)**: The program outputs `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. The Manhattan distances are `|1-1| + |1-1| = 0` and `|1-1| + |2-1| = 1`, resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\). This is correct for \(n = 2\).

2. **For \(n = 3\)**: The program outputs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`. The Manhattan distances are:
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 3)`: `|1-2| + |1-3| = 3`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 3)`: `|1-2| + |2-3| = 2`
   - Resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). This is correct for \(n = 3\).

3. **For \(n = 4\)**: The program outputs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(4, 4)`. The Manhattan distances are:
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: `|1-2| + |1-4| = 4`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: `|1-4| + |1-4| = 6`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: `|1-2| + |2-4| = 3`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`: `|1-4| + |2-4| = 5`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: `|2-4| + |4-4| = 2`
   - Resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). This is correct for \(n = 4\).

4. **For \(n = 5\)**: The program outputs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, and `(5, 5)`. The Manhattan distances are:
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: `|1-2| + |1-4| = 4`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: `|1-4| + |1-4| = 6`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(5, 5)`: `|1-5| + |1-5| = 8`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: `|1-2| + |2-4| = 3`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`: `|1-4| + |2-4| = 5`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(5, 5)`: `|1-5| + |2-5| = 7`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: `|2-4| + |4-4| = 2`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(5, 5)`: `|2-5| + |4-5| = 4`
   - Between `(4, 4)` and `(5, 5)`: `|4-5| + |4-5| = 2`
   - Resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\). This is correct for \(n = 5\).

5. **For \(n = 6\)**: The program outputs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, and `(6, 1)`. The Manhattan distances are:
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: `|1-2| + |1-4| = 4`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: `|1-4| + |1-4| = 6`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(5, 5)`: `|1-5| + |1-5| = 8`
   - Between `(1, 1)` and `(6, 1)`: `|1-6| + |1-1| = 5`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: `|1-2| + |2-4| = 3`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`: `|1-4| + |2-4| = 5`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(5, 5)`: `|1-5| + |2-5| = 7`
   - Between `(1, 2)` and `(6, 1)`: `|1-6| + |2-1| = 6`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: `|2-4| + |4-4| = 2`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(5, 5)`: `|2-5| + |4-5| = 4`
   - Between `(2, 4)` and `(6, 1)`: `|2-6| + |4-1| = 7`
   - Between `(4, 4)` and `(5, 5)`: `|4-5| + |4-5| = 2`
   - Between `(4, 4)` and `(6, 1)`: `|4-6| + |4-1| = 5`
   - Between `(5, 5)` and `(6, 1)`: `|5-6| + |5-1| = 5`
   - Resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\). This is correct for \(n = 6\).

However, the program does not generalize correctly for all \(n\). For example, for \(n = 7\), the program would output `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, `(6, 1)`, and `(7, 7)`. The Manhattan distances do not cover all possible distinct distances, and thus, the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is not maximized.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide a general solution that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).
