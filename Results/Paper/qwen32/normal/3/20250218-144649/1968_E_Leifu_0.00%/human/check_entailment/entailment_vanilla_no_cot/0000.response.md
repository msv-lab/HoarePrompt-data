Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all \(n\). Let's analyze the program and the problem requirements:

1. For \(n = 2\), the program correctly outputs two points: (1,1) and (1,2). This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is optimal.

2. For \(n = 3\), the program outputs (1,1), (1,2), and (2,3). This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is optimal.

3. For \(n \ge 4\), the program outputs (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), and then \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\). This pattern does not maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n > 3\).

The pattern used for \(n \ge 4\) does not effectively cover a wide range of Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n = 4\), the points (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4) do not generate the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances. A more optimal arrangement for \(n = 4\) could be (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (4,4), which would give a set \(\mathcal{H}\) with more distinct distances.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of \(n\), specifically for \(n \ge 4\). Thus, the correctness is False.
