To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break it down step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and Their Ranges:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` is an integer and \(n > 3\).
   - `j` is an integer such that \(5 \leq j \leq n\).

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.
   - It converts the integer `j` to a string twice and concatenates them with a space in between.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `j` is an integer within the range \(5 \leq j \leq n\), the value of `j` can be any integer from 5 to `n`.
   - The output will be the string representation of `j` repeated twice with a space in between.

Given the ranges, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `j` without more specific information. However, we can describe the output in terms of `j`.

Output: **j j (where j is an integer such that 5 <= j <= n)**
