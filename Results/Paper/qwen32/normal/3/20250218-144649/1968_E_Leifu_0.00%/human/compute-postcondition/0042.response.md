Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `i` is defined as `t - 1`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
- `j` is explicitly set to 6.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `j` is explicitly set to 6.
- The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and the string representation of `j` again.

### Output:
The code will print the string "6 6" because `j` is 6, and the `print` statement concatenates `str(j)` (which is "6") with a space and `str(j)` again.

### Final Answer:
Output: **6 6**
