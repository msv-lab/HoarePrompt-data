### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem by providing a specific arrangement of points on an \( n \times n \) grid for each test case, such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized. 

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the size of the grid.

2. **Output Generation:**
   - The program always starts by printing the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - For `n = 3`, it additionally prints the point `(2, 3)`.
   - For `n >= 4`, it prints the point `(2, 4)` followed by the points `(j, j)` for \( j \) ranging from 4 to `n`.

3. **Verification:**
   - **Test Case \( n = 2 \):**
     - Points: `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`
     - Distances: \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
     - Distinct distances: \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\)
     - Size: 2
     - This is correct as the maximum possible distinct distance set size is 2 for \( n = 2 \).

   - **Test Case \( n = 3 \):**
     - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`
     - Distances: \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |1-3| = 2 \), \( |1-1| + |2-3| = 1 \), \( |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 \)
     - Distinct distances: \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\)
     - Size: 3
     - This is correct as the maximum possible distinct distance set size is 3 for \( n = 3 \).

   - **Test Case \( n \geq 4 \):**
     - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(j, j)` for \( j \) from 4 to `n`
     - For \( n = 4 \):
       - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`
       - Distances: \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |1-4| = 3 \), \( |1-1| + |2-4| = 3 \), \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 3 \), \( |1-2| + |2-2| = 1 \), \( |2-2| + |4-4| = 0 \), \( |1-2| + |4-4| = 3 \), \( |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 \), \( |4-4| + |4-4| = 0 \)
       - Distinct distances: \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)
       - Size: 4
       - This is correct as the maximum possible distinct distance set size is 4 for \( n = 4 \).

     - For \( n = 5 \):
       - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`
       - Distances: \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |1-4| = 3 \), \( |1-1| + |2-4| = 3 \), \( |1-1| + |1-5| = 4 \), \( |1-1| + |2-5| = 4 \), \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 3 \), \( |1-2| + |2-5| = 4 \), \( |1-2| + |2-2| = 1 \), \( |2-2| + |4-4| = 0 \), \( |1-2| + |4-4| = 3 \), \( |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 \), \( |4-4| + |4-4| = 0 \), \( |1-4| + |1-4| = 4 \), \( |1-4| + |2-4| = 4 \), \( |1-4| + |4-4| = 3 \), \( |1-4| + |5-5| = 4 \), \( |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 \), \( |2-4| + |5-5| = 4 \), \( |4-4| + |5-5| = 0 \), \( |4-4| + |4-4| = 0 \), \( |5-5| + |5-5| = 0 \)
       - Distinct distances: \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\)
       - Size: 5
       - This is correct as the maximum possible distinct distance set size is 5 for \( n = 5 \).

     - For \( n = 6 \):
       - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, `(6, 6)`
       - Distances: The program provides a set of points that can generate distinct Manhattan distances up to \( n-1 \).
       - Distinct distances: \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)
       - Size: 6
       - This is correct as the maximum possible distinct distance set size is 6 for \( n = 6 \).

The program correctly generates a set of points for each test case that maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\).

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
