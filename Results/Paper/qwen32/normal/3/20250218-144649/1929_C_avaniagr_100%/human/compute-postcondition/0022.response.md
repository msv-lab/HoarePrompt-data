Let's break down the task and compute the new value of `z` based on the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s`
- `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`
- `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`
- `i` is incremented by 1

The code snippet to be executed:
```python
z += z // (k - 1) + 1
```

The value of `z` is updated as follows:
- First, compute `z // (k - 1) + 1`
- Add this result to the current value of `z` to get the new value of `z`

Let's denote the initial value of `z` as `z_initial`:
- `z_initial = k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`

The new value of `z` after executing the code snippet is:
- `z_new = z_initial + (z_initial // (k - 1) + 1)`

Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. However, `i` is not used in the calculation of `z`, so its value is simply incremented.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s`, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + (z_initial // (k - 1) + 1)`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
