You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The program checks three conditions for the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`:
1. If `x < k - 1`:
   - It checks if `a >= x + 1` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".
2. If `x == k - 1`:
   - It checks if `a >= x + 2` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".
3. If `x > k - 1`:
   - It calculates `z` and iteratively updates it based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` times.
   - It then checks if `a >= z` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".

However, the logic for the third condition is not entirely clear and may not cover all edge cases. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `z` does not seem to correctly account for all scenarios where Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the potential issue:
- Input: `k = 3`, `x = 3`, `a = 6`
- Expected Output: "YES"

According to the problem statement, Sasha can use the following strategy:
1. Bet 1 coin.
2. If he wins, he has 3 coins and can bet 1 coin again.
3. If he wins again, he has 6 coins and can bet 1 coin again.
4. If he loses, he still has 3 coins and can bet 1 coin again.
5. If he loses again, he still has 2 coins and can bet 1 coin again.
6. If he loses again, he still has 1 coin and can bet 1 coin again.
7. If he wins, he has 3 coins and can bet 1 coin again.
8. If he wins again, he has 6 coins and can bet 1 coin again.

In this scenario, Sasha can always guarantee to have at least 6 coins, so the output should be "YES".

However, the provided program will calculate `z` as follows:
- `z = k - 2 = 1`
- `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3 = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3` times:
  - Iteration 1: `z = 1 + 1 // 2 + 1 = 2`
  - Iteration 2: `z = 2 + 2 // 2 + 1 = 4`
  - Iteration 3: `z = 4 + 4 // 2 + 1 = 7`

Since `a = 6` and `z = 7`, the program will print "NO", which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
