Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s` from the next line of input. If `x == k - 1`, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `x > k - 3` and `z` is calculated through the formula \( z_{i+1} = z_i + \left\lfloor \frac{z_i}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 \) for `x - k + 3` iterations starting from `z = k - 1` if `k != 2`, or `z = 1` if `k = 2`. The condition `a >= z` holds if `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `z`; otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.**
