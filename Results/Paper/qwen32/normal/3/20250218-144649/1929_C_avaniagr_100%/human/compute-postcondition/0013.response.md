The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that directly outputs the string `'NO'`. This output does not depend on the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the string as it is.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`) and their relationships but does not influence the output of the `print` statement.
2. The `print('NO')` statement is executed regardless of the values of these variables.
3. The string `'NO'` is explicitly specified in the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
