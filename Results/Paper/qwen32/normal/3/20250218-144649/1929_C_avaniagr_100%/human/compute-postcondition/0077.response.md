To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the input values for each test case.

The loop processes `t` test cases, where each test case is defined by three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`. The loop logic checks the value of `x` relative to `k` and calculates a threshold value `z` if necessary. The final output for each test case is either `YES` or `NO` based on the comparison of `a` with the calculated threshold.

Here's a breakdown of the loop logic:

1. **If `x < k - 1`:**
   - If `a >= x + 1`, print `YES`.
   - Otherwise, print `NO`.

2. **If `x == k - 1`:**
   - If `a >= x + 2`, print `YES`.
   - Otherwise, print `NO`.

3. **If `x > k - 1`:**
   - Initialize `z = k - 2`.
   - Iterate `x - k + 3` times, updating `z` as `z = z + (z // (k - 1)) + 1`.
   - If `a >= z`, print `YES`.
   - Otherwise, print `NO`.

The loop processes each test case independently and prints `YES` or `NO` based on the above conditions.

Given that the loop processes all `t` test cases, the final output state will be a series of `YES` or `NO` outputs, one for each test case.

**Output State:** **After processing all `t` test cases, the output state will be a series of `YES` or `NO` outputs, each corresponding to the result of the conditions evaluated for each test case.**

In simpler terms, the output state after all the executions of the loop will be a list of `YES` or `NO` values, one for each test case provided in the input.
