You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if `a` meets or exceeds a certain threshold based on the values of `k` and `x`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The threshold is determined by specific conditions involving `k` and `x`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
Sasha can place bets in a casino with the following conditions:
- If he wins a bet of `y` coins, he gets `y * k` coins in total, meaning his number of coins increases by `y * (k - 1)`.
- If he loses a bet of `y` coins, he loses those `y` coins.
- He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

The goal is to determine if Sasha can guarantee that he can achieve any number of coins `n` by placing bets according to the rules.

### Key Observations:
1. **Minimum Coins Needed to Guarantee a Win:**
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can potentially recover from a series of losses by betting small amounts.
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs a bit more to ensure he can recover from the maximum allowed consecutive losses.
   - If `x > k - 1`, Sasha needs to calculate the minimum amount of coins required to ensure he can recover from the maximum allowed consecutive losses.

2. **Strategy for Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
     - Sasha can place small bets and recover from losses.
     - Minimum coins required: `x + 1`.
   - **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
     - Sasha needs an additional coin to ensure he can recover from the maximum allowed consecutive losses.
     - Minimum coins required: `x + 2`.
   - **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
     - Sasha needs to calculate the minimum coins required to ensure he can recover from the maximum allowed consecutive losses.
     - This involves a more complex calculation that the program seems to attempt.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to handle the different cases:
- It correctly identifies the cases where `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`.
- For `x > k - 1`, it attempts to calculate the minimum coins required using a loop that updates the value `z` based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.

### Detailed Check of the Program:
1. **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
   - The program correctly checks if `a >= x + 1` and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
   
2. **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
   - The program correctly checks if `a >= x + 2` and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
   
3. **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
   - The loop in the program attempts to calculate the minimum coins required.
   - The loop runs `x - k + 3` times, updating `z` based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - This loop seems to be an attempt to simulate the process of recovering from losses, but the exact logic might not be fully correct.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to have the correct logic for the first two cases, but the logic for the third case might be incorrect or incomplete. Specifically, the loop that calculates the minimum coins required for `x > k - 1` might not be correctly simulating the process of recovering from losses.

Given the complexity of the problem and the provided solution, it is not entirely clear if the loop correctly calculates the minimum coins required for the third case. However, based on the examples provided, the program seems to produce the correct output for the given test cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program seems to correctly handle the given test cases and the logic appears to be correct based on the problem description. However, a more rigorous mathematical proof or additional test cases might be needed to fully verify the correctness of the solution for all possible inputs.
