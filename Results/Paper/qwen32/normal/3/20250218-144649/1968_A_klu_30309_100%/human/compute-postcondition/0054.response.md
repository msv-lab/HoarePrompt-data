The code appends the current value of `best_y` to the `results` list. The value of `best_y` is 1, so `1` is added to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`.**
