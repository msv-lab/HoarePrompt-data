The code snippet assigns the value of `gcd_val + y` to `current_sum`. No other variables are modified by this code.

Given that `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `y` is `y - 1`, the value of `current_sum` will be the sum of `gcd_val` and the decremented `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is the maximum value between the original `max_sum` and `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**
