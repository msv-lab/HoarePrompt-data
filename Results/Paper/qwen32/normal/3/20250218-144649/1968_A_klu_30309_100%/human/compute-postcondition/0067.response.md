Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum` was greater than `max_sum`, otherwise `best_y` remains 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2, `y` is `x - 2`**

In natural language: The value of `gcd_val` is updated to the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. All other variables retain their previous values.
