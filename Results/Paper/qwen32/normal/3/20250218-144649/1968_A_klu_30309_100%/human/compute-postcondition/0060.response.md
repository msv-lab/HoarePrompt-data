The code snippet provided is:
```
current_sum = gcd_val + y
```

However, the variable `y` is not defined in the initial state. To proceed, I will assume that `y` is intended to be `best_y` based on the context provided. If `y` were meant to be a different variable, the output would not be determinable with the given information.

Given this assumption, the code snippet should be:
```
current_sum = gcd_val + best_y
```

Now, evaluating the impact of this code on the program:
- `gcd_val` is 1.
- `best_y` is 1.

Thus, `current_sum` will be calculated as:
```
current_sum = 1 + 1 = 2
```

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `max_sum`, `x`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2.**
