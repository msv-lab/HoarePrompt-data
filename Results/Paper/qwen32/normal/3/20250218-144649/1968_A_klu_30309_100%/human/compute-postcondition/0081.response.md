The code snippet `results.append(best_y)` appends the value of `best_y` to the `results` list. 

Given the initial state, `results` already contains the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended. After executing the code snippet, `results` will have one more element, which is the `best_y` corresponding to the last `x` processed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended and one more `best_y` appended, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd(x, y) + y` found during the loop, `best_y` is the `y` that provided this maximum sum for the last `x` processed, `x` is the last element in `test_cases`, and `y` is the value that provided the maximum sum for the last `x` processed.**
