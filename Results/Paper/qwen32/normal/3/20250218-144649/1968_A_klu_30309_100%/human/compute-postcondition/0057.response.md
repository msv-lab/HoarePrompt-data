The code snippet provided simply reassigns the value `1` to the variable `best_y`. This operation does not affect any other variables in the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**.

In natural language: The value of `best_y` is set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
