Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is the current value of `y` that resulted in `current_sum`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y` and is greater than the previous `max_sum`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `best_y` has been updated to the current value of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
