The code snippet `current_sum = gcd_val + y` updates the value of `current_sum` based on the current values of `gcd_val` and `y`. Given the initial state, `y` is defined as `x - 2` and `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`. Therefore, the new value of `current_sum` will be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum` was greater than `max_sum`, otherwise `best_y` remains 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is 2, `y` is `x - 2`**.

In natural language, the value of `current_sum` has been updated to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
