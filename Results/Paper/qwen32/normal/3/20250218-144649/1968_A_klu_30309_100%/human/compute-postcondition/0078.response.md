Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `best_y` is equal to `y`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `y` is `y + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
