You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each of the `t` test cases. For each test case, if either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, the program prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, if both `a` and `b` are odd, the program prints 'No'. After all `t` iterations, the loop terminates and no further input is processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting his original rectangle, we need to analyze the conditions under which he can achieve this.

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to one of the sides, he can either make a cut parallel to the side of length `a` or parallel to the side of length `b`.
   - If the cut is made parallel to the side of length `a`, the resulting rectangles will have dimensions `(a/2, b)` and `(a/2, b)`.
   - If the cut is made parallel to the side of length `b`, the resulting rectangles will have dimensions `(a, b/2)` and `(a, b/2)`.

2. **Forming Another Rectangle:**
   - For Bob to form another rectangle, the two resulting rectangles must be able to be rearranged into a new rectangle with different dimensions.
   - If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `(a/2, b)`. These two rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of size `(a, b/2)` if `b` is even, or `(a/2, 2b)` if `b` is odd. However, the key point is that if `a` is even, he can always form a new rectangle.
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `(a, b/2)`. These two rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of size `(a/2, b)` if `a` is even, or `(2a, b/2)` if `a` is odd. Again, if `b` is even, he can always form a new rectangle.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the resulting rectangles will be of size `(a, 1)` and `(a, b-1)` or `(1, b)` and `(a-1, b)`, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Thus, the condition for Bob to be able to form another rectangle is that at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) must be even.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly checks if either `a` or `b` is even and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". This logic aligns with the reasoning above.

### Correctness:
