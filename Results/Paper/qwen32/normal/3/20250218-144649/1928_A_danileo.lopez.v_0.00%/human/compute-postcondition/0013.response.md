The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop will execute `t` times, and the loop variable `_` is incremented automatically by the `range` function.

Given that the loop will execute `t` times, at the start of the next iteration, the loop variable `_` will have been incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` do not change within the loop head.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. Regardless of whether the condition `a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0` is true or false, either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, or both `a` and `b` are odd integers.

At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1.
