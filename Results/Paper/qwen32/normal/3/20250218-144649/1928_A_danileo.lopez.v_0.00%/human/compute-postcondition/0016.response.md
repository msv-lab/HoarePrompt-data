The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`. The statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement will print the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Output: **No**
