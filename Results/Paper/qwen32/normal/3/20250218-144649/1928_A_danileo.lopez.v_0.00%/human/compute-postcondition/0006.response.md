The given initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `a` and `b` are odd integers.

However, the `print` statement in the provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print('No')
```
This statement prints the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the output of this `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **No**
