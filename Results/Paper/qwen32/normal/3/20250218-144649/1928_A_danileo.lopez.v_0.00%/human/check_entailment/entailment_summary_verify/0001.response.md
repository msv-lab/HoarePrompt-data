### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key condition for Bob to form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting his original rectangle. The assessment states that Bob can form another rectangle if at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) is even. This is because:

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `(a/2, b)`. These two rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `(a, b/2)` if `b` is even, or `(a/2, 2b)` if `b` is odd.
   - If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `(a, b/2)`. These two rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `(a/2, b)` if `a` is even, or `(2a, b/2)` if `a` is odd.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the resulting rectangles will be `(a, 1)` and `(a, b-1)` or `(1, b)` and `(a-1, b)`, which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

2. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No".

3. **Program Code:**
   - The program code correctly implements the logic described in the function summary and the reasoning above. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes", otherwise "No".

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle based on the given conditions.

### Final:
Final: **True**
