### Reasoning:
To determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut parallel to one of the sides, we need to analyze the properties of the original rectangle.

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle along the side of length `a`, he gets two rectangles of dimensions `a/2 x b` (if `a` is even) or `a/2 x b` and `a/2 x b` with a remainder (if `a` is odd).
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle along the side of length `b`, he gets two rectangles of dimensions `a x b/2` (if `b` is even) or `a x b/2` and `a x b/2` with a remainder (if `b` is odd).

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always form another rectangle. For example, if `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles and then combine them to form a new rectangle of dimensions `a x b/2` (or `b x a/2` which is the same).
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle because he will always end up with two rectangles of dimensions `a/2 x b` and `a/2 x (b-1)` (or `a x b/2` and `a x (b/2 - 1)`), and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with integer sides.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements this logic. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even and prints "Yes" if so, and "No" otherwise. This aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
