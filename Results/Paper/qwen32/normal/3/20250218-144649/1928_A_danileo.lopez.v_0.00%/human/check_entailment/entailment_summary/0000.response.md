### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting an `a x b` rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them. The key insight here is that if either dimension (`a` or `b`) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle in such a way that he can form a different rectangle by rearranging the pieces. This is because with an even dimension, he can always cut the rectangle into two equal parts along that dimension, and then rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

For example:
- If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles and rearrange them to form a `b x a/2` rectangle (which is different from `a x b` unless `a = b`).
- Similarly, if `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles and rearrange them to form an `a/2 x b` rectangle.

However, if both `a` and `b` are odd, then any cut will result in two rectangles with at least one dimension being odd, and it is impossible to rearrange these to form a new rectangle with integer dimensions that is different from the original `a x b` rectangle (since the total area remains the same and the only possible rearrangements would result in the same dimensions).

The provided program correctly implements this logic: it checks if either `a` or `b` is even and prints "Yes" if so, otherwise it prints "No". This matches the reasoning outlined above.

### Correctness: **True**
