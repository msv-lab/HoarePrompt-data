### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

**Problem Analysis:**
- Bob starts with a rectangle of size `a x b`.
- He makes a cut parallel to one of the sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles.
- He then tries to form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other.

**Key Observations:**
1. **Cutting Parallel to Side `a`:**
   - Resulting rectangles: `(a/2, b)` and `(a/2, b)` if `a` is even.
   - These can be rearranged into a new rectangle of size `(a, b/2)` if `b` is even, or `(a/2, 2b)` if `b` is odd.
   - If `a` is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.

2. **Cutting Parallel to Side `b`:**
   - Resulting rectangles: `(a, b/2)` and `(a, b/2)` if `b` is even.
   - These can be rearranged into a new rectangle of size `(a/2, b)` if `a` is even, or `(2a, b/2)` if `a` is odd.
   - If `b` is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.

3. **Both `a` and `b` are Odd:**
   - Resulting rectangles: `(a, 1)` and `(a, b-1)` or `(1, b)` and `(a-1, b)`.
   - These cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
- It checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
- If either `a` or `b` is even, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

**Annotations and Original Assessment:**
- The annotations correctly describe the program's behavior.
- The original assessment aligns with the reasoning above.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly implements the logic that if at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) is even, Bob can form another rectangle. This aligns with the problem description and the analysis provided.
