To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

The problem statement asks us to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two rectangles he gets after cutting the original rectangle `a x b` into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. The key observation is that if either `a` or `b` is even, then it's possible to cut the rectangle in such a way that the two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then the only possible rectangles that can be formed from the smaller rectangles are rotations of the original rectangle.

The provided program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes", indicating that it's possible to form another rectangle. If both are odd, it prints "No".

Let's verify this logic:

1. If `a` is even, we can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a/2 x b` and `a/2 x b`. These can be rearranged to form a rectangle of dimensions `a x (b/2)` or `(b/2) x a`, which is different from the original rectangle.
2. If `b` is even, we can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a x b/2` and `a x b/2`. These can be rearranged to form a rectangle of dimensions `(a/2) x b` or `b x (a/2)`, which is different from the original rectangle.
3. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then any cut will result in two rectangles with at least one dimension being 1 (since we can only cut by an integer amount). The only rectangles that can be formed from these are rotations of the original rectangle.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

**Correctness: True**
