The provided initial state does not affect the execution of the given print statement. The statement `print('Yes')` is a direct output of the string "Yes" regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b` but does not influence the print statement.
2. The print statement is `print('Yes')`, which outputs the string "Yes" directly.

Given that the print statement is independent of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`, the output will always be "Yes".

Output: **Yes**
