To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and understand the values of the variables `maxi`, `i`, and their relationships.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is at least 2.
- `maxi` is set to `i` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise `maxi` remains unchanged.
- `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to \(n-1\)) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response.
- `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`.
- `res` is the input string.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Key Points:
- The `print` statement outputs the values `maxi`, `maxi`, `i`, and `i` with a leading `?` character.
- The values of `maxi` and `i` are influenced by the responses received in the form of `res`.

### Explanation of `maxi` and `i`:
- `maxi` is updated to `i` only if the response `res` is `'<'`. Otherwise, it retains its previous value.
- `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, starting from some initial value (not specified but assumed to be 1 or another valid starting index).

### Output:
Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

The output will be:
- `'?'` is a constant string.
- `maxi` is the value of `maxi` at the time of execution.
- `maxi` is repeated.
- `i` is the value of `i` at the time of execution.
- `i` is repeated.

Since the exact values of `maxi` and `i` depend on the responses received (`res`), we cannot determine their exact numerical values without additional information. However, we can describe their roles and values based on the given initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where maxi is the index set to i if res is '<', otherwise unchanged, and i is the current index incremented by 1)**
