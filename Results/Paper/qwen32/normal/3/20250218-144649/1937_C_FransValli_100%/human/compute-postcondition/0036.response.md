Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`. `res` is the value of the user input. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]` or `[i, i]` depending on previous appends. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]` or `[0, i, i]` depending on previous appends. Otherwise, `arr` remains `[0]`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, taking into account the condition `if res == '=':` and the absence of an else part.
