To determine the final state of the loop after all iterations are completed, let's analyze the provided loop and the output states after the first 3 iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. In each iteration, it prints a formatted string and then reads a response (`res`) from the user. If `res` is `'<'`, it updates `maxi` to the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `maxi` remains unchanged.

### Iteration Details:
1. **After 1st Iteration**:
   - `i = 1`
   - `maxi` is updated to `1` if `res` is `'<'`; otherwise, `maxi` remains `0`.

2. **After 2nd Iteration**:
   - `i = 2`
   - `maxi` is updated to `2` if `res` is `'<'`; otherwise, it retains its previous value.

3. **After 3rd Iteration**:
   - `i = 3`
   - `maxi` is updated to `3` if `res` is `'<'`; otherwise, it retains its previous value.

### Generalizing the Pattern:
- The loop continues until `i` reaches `n - 1`.
- `maxi` holds the highest value of `i` for which `res` was `'<'`.

### Final State:
- After all iterations, `i` will have taken all values from `1` to `n - 1`.
- `maxi` will hold the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'`.

### Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the input integer.
- `maxi` will be the largest index `i` for which the user input was `'<'`.

Given the pattern, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, and `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`.**

In simple terms, `maxi` will be the highest number between 1 and `n-1` for which the user responded with `'<'`.
