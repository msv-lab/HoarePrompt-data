Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is at least 2.
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received.
- `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`.
- `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, or `arr` includes the new element `i` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged.
- `res` is the input string.
- `i` is `x + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a literal string.
2. **`maxi`**: This is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received.
3. **`arr[0]`**: This is the first element of the list `arr`. The value of `arr[0]` depends on the responses received (`'<'`, `'='`, or other responses).
4. **`maxi`**: This is repeated, so it will print the same value as the second element.
5. **`i`**: This is `x + 1`. The value of `x` is not specified, so `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is some integer.

### Output:
The output will be a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi`, then the first element of `arr`, then `maxi` again, and finally the value of `i`.

Since the exact values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, and `i` are not provided, we can only describe them based on the given conditions.

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] (where maxi is the largest index i for which the response was '<' or 0 if no such response was received, arr[0] is the first element of arr, and i is x + 1)**
