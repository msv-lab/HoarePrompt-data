Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `res` is the value of the user input.
   - If `res` is `'<'`, then `maxi` is set to the value of `i`.
   - Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.
   - `i` is 4.

2. **Python Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 4.
   - The value of `maxi` depends on the user input `res`:
     - If `res` is `'<'`, then `maxi` is set to `i`, which is 4.
     - If `res` is anything other than `'<'`, then `maxi` remains 0.

4. **Possible Values:**
   - If `res` is `'<'`, the output will be `? 4 4 4 4`.
   - If `res` is not `'<'`, the output will be `? 0 0 4 4`.

Since we do not have the specific value of `res` from the user input, we need to consider both possibilities.

**Output:**
Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 4 4 (where maxi is 4 if res is '<', otherwise maxi is 0)**
