Let's break down the provided initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant for this task.
2. **`n`**: An integer that is at least 2. This variable is also not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant for this task.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received. This variable is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant for this task.
4. **`mini`**: Set to `arr[0]`, which means `mini` is the first element of the list `arr`.
5. **`arr`**: A list containing at least two elements where the response was `'='`. This means that at least two elements in the list `arr` are equal to each other.
6. **`item`**: Set to `arr[1]`, which means `item` is the second element of the list `arr`.

### Print Statement Analysis
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

- **`'?'`**: This is a literal string `'?'`.
- **`mini`**: This is the first element of the list `arr`.
- **`mini`**: This is the first element of the list `arr` (repeated).
- **`item`**: This is the second element of the list `arr`.
- **`item`**: This is the second element of the list `arr` (repeated).

### Output Description
The print statement will output a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` twice, and the second element of the list `arr` twice.

### Final Output
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the first element of the list arr and [item] is the second element of the list arr)**
