Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` (unchanged from the initial state), `mini` is `arr[0]`, and `arr` contains all indices `i` from `1` to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the input integer; `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`; `mini` is `item` if `res` equals `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains `arr[0]`; `arr` must have at least two elements; `res` is the user's input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the input integer; `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`; `mini` is `item` if `res` equals `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains `arr[0]`; `arr` must have at least two elements; `res` is the new user's input; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`. If `res` equals `'>'`, then `mini` is updated to `item`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the input integer; `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`; `mini` is `item` if `res` equals `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains `arr[0]`; `arr` must have at least two elements; `res` is the new user's input; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]` after the current `item`. If `res` equals `'>'`, then `mini` is set to `item`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
