The code snippet `arr = [i]` directly assigns a new list containing the current value of `i` to the variable `arr`. This means the previous value of `arr` (which could be `[i]`, `[0, i]`, or `[0]` based on the initial conditions) is replaced by the new list `[i]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `maxi` is still the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`.
- `res` remains the value of the user input.
- `arr` is now `[i]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `res` is the value of the user input, `arr` is `[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
