Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user input was `'<'`.
   - `arr` is `[0]`.

2. **Code to Execute:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is attempting to print several values: `'?'`, `maxi`, `arr[0]`, `maxi`, and `i`.
   - `maxi` is defined as the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user input was `'<'`. Since the initial state does not provide any information about the user inputs, we cannot determine an exact value for `maxi`. However, we know that `maxi` is a valid index between 1 and `n-1` where the input was `'<'`.
   - `arr[0]` is explicitly given as `0` because `arr` is initialized as `[0]`.
   - `i` is not defined in the given initial state. Therefore, the code will raise a `NameError` because `i` is used without being assigned a value.

Since the variable `i` is not defined, the code will not execute successfully as it is. However, if we assume the intention was to use `maxi` in place of `i` (a common mistake), the output would be:

- The first value to print is the string `'?'`.
- The second value to print is `maxi`, which is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the user input was `'<'`.
- The third value to print is `arr[0]`, which is `0`.
- The fourth value to print is again `maxi`.
- The fifth value to print would be `i`, but since `i` is not defined, we assume it should be `maxi` as per the pattern.

Thus, if we assume `i` should be `maxi`, the output would be:

Output: **? [maxi] 0 [maxi] [maxi] (where maxi is the largest index i from 1 to n-1 where the user input was '<')**.

However, since the code as given will raise an error due to the undefined `i`, the precise and correct answer based on the given information is that the code will not execute successfully due to the `NameError`. If we assume the intention was to use `maxi` in place of `i`, then the output would be as described above. 

Given the strict adherence to the format and the presence of the undefined variable, the correct response is:

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**.
