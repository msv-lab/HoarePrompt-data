Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the input integer; `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`; `mini` is `item` if `res` equals `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains `arr[0]`; `arr` must have at least two elements; `res` is the new user's input; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]` after the current `item`.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated to the new user's input, while all other variables retain their previous values.
