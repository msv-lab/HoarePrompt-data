To determine what will be printed by the provided `print` statement, we need to break down the information given in the initial state and understand the context in which the variables are used.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`.
4. **`mini`**: The smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`.
5. **`res`**: The new input string, which can be `'<'`, `'='`, or any other character.
6. **`arr`**: 
   - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is updated to `[i]`.
   - If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is updated to `[0, i]`.
   - Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.
7. **`i`**: An integer that is incremented by 1 each time.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

- **`'?'`**: A literal string.
- **`maxi`**: The largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`. This is a specific integer value.
- **`arr[0]`**: The first element of the list `arr`. Given the conditions:
  - If `res` was `'<'`, `arr[0]` is `i`.
  - If `res` was `'='`, `arr[0]` is `0`.
  - Otherwise, `arr[0]` retains its previous value.
- **`maxi`**: The largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`. This is the same value as the second `maxi`.
- **`i`**: The current value of `i` which has been incremented by 1.

### Output Derivation:
Since `maxi` appears twice in the print statement, it will be printed twice with the same value. The value of `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`:
- If `res` was `'<'`, `arr[0]` is `i`.
- If `res` was `'='`, `arr[0]` is `0`.
- Otherwise, `arr[0]` retains its previous value, which we cannot determine without more context but will represent as `arr[0]`.

### Final Output:
Given the conditions and the information provided, the output will be:
- `'?'`: Literal string.
- `maxi`: The largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`.
- `arr[0]`: The first element of `arr`, which depends on the value of `res`.
- `maxi`: The same value as the first `maxi`.
- `i`: The current value of `i`.

Thus, the precise output will be:
Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] (where [maxi] is the largest index i for which the response was '<', [arr[0]] is the first element of arr, and [i] is the current value of i)**
