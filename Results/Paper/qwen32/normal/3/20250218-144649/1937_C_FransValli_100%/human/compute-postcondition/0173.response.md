Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` includes the new element `i` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged, `res` is the input string, `i` is `x + 1`.**
