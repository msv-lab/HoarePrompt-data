Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `arr` contains [0], `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `res` is the input string, and `res` is not `'<'`**
