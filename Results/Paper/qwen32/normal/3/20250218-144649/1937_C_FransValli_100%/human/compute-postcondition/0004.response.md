To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `maxi` is 0
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown based on the given information.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

We can deduce the following:
- The string `'?'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is explicitly given as 0.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown and cannot be determined from the given information.

Since `i` is not defined, we cannot provide a specific value for it in the output. However, we can describe the output in terms of the known values and the unknown variable `i`.

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is an undefined integer variable)**
