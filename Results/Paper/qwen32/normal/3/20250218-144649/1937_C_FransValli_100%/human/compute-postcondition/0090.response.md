The code snippet `arr = [i]` reassigns the variable `arr` to a new list containing only the current index `i`. This means the previous content of `arr` (which was `[0]`) is replaced by `[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `res`, and `mini`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `res` is `'<'`, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `arr` is `[i]`.**
