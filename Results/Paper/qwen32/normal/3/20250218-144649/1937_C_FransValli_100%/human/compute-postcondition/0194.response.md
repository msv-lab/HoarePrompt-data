To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values and meanings of the variables `maxi` and `mini` as described.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it's not directly used in the `print` statement.
2. **n**: An integer that is at least 2. This variable represents the number of elements in the list `arr`.
3. **maxi**: The largest index \(i\) for which the response was '<'. If no such response was received, `maxi` is 0.
4. **mini**: The smallest element among `arr[0]` and all elements in `arr[1:]` for which the response was '>'.
5. **arr**: A list containing indices \(i\) (from 1 to \(n-1\)) for which the response was '='.
6. **item**: The last element processed in `arr[1:]`. This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement.

### Analysis of the `print` Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```
This statement will print the string `'!'`, followed by the values of `maxi` and `mini`.

### Values of `maxi` and `mini`:
- **maxi**: This is the largest index \(i\) for which the response was '<'. If no such response was received, `maxi` is 0.
- **mini**: This is the smallest element among `arr[0]` and all elements in `arr[1:]` for which the response was '>'.
  - If no responses were '<' or '>', `mini` will be the smallest element among `arr[0]` and `arr[1:]` that received a response of '='.
  - If no responses were received at all, `mini` will be `arr[0]`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state, the `print` statement will output the string `'!'`, followed by the value of `maxi` and the value of `mini`.

Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where maxi is the largest index i for which the response was '<' or 0 if no such response was received, and mini is the smallest element among arr[0] and all elements in arr[1:] for which the response was '>')**
