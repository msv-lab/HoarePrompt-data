Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received, `mini` is `arr[1]` if `res` is `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains `arr[0]`, `arr` contains at least two elements where the response was `'='`, `item` is `arr[1]`, and if `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is updated to `arr[1]`.**
