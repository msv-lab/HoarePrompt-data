The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` is initially `[0]`. After appending `i`, `arr` becomes `[0, i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` is `[0, i]`, `res` is equal to `'='`**.
