Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, and `arr` must have at least two elements, `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`, `res` is the user input, `mini` is the value of `item`.**

In simple terms: The value of `mini` is now set to the value of `item`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
