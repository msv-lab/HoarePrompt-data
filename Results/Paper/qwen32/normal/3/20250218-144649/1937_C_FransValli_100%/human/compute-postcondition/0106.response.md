The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns a new list containing the current value of `i` to the variable `arr`. This means the previous value of `arr` is overwritten with this new list. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is `[i]`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
