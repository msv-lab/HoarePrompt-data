Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise `maxi` remains unchanged, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, `res` is the new input value, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `res` is updated to the new input value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, `arr`, and `i`) remain as they were, except that `i` is incremented by 1.
