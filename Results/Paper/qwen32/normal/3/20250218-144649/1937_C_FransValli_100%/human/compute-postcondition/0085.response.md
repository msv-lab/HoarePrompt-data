The code snippet provided is `arr = [0]`. This line of code reassigns the variable `arr` to a new list containing a single element, `0`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `arr` contains [0], `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`.**
