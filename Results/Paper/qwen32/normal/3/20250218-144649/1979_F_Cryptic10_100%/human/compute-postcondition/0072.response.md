Let's analyze the code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- `vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers.
- `ops` is a list of tuples representing operations and must contain exactly one tuple.
- `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the only tuple in `ops`.

The code snippet:
```python
(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
```

This line of code checks if the last element of `p1` (which is the only tuple in `ops`) is equal to `v2`. If it is, it appends `v1` to `p2`. If it is not, it appends `v1` to `p1`.

Since `ops` contains exactly one tuple, `p1` and `p2` must refer to the same tuple in `ops` because there is no other tuple to refer to. Therefore, the condition `p1[-1] == v2` will be evaluated, and `v1` will be appended to `p1` (which is the only tuple in `ops`).

Let's denote the initial tuple in `ops` as `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are integers. So, `v1 = a` and `v2 = b`.

The code will append `v1` to this tuple, changing the tuple from `(a, b)` to `(a, b, a)`.

Thus, the updated `ops` will be a list containing the modified tuple.

Output State: **`vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers; `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(a, b, a)` where `a` and `b` are the initial elements of the tuple in `ops`.**
