Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers.
- `ops` is a list of tuples representing operations.
- `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any `v1` values that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of processing.
- `p2` contains any `v1` values that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of processing.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reversing `p1`**: The expression `p1[::-1]` reverses the list `p1`.
2. **Concatenating `p1` and `p2`**: The expression `p1[::-1] + p2` concatenates the reversed `p1` with `p2`.
3. **Mapping to Strings**: The `map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)` function converts each element of the concatenated list to a string.
4. **Joining Strings**: The `' '.join(...)` function joins the list of strings with a space `' '` as the separator.
5. **Formatting and Printing**: The `print('! %s' % ...)` statement formats the joined string with an exclamation mark `'!'` at the beginning and prints it.

### Output Description:
To provide the most precise description, we need to consider the values of `p1` and `p2` based on the initial state. Since the exact values of `vx`, `ops`, `p1`, and `p2` are not specified, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

- `p1` initially contains the two integers from `vx` and may have additional integers from `ops` that did not match the last element of `p1`.
- `p2` contains integers from `ops` that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of processing.

The output will be a string starting with `'!'`, followed by the elements of `p1` in reverse order, followed by the elements of `p2`, all separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **! [reversed p1 elements] [p2 elements] (where [reversed p1 elements] are the elements of p1 in reverse order and [p2 elements] are the elements of p2)**
