The code snippet appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `vx`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ops` now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input value (inclusive) excluding `v1`; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`; `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any `v1` values that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of processing; `p2` contains any `v1` values that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of processing; `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)` with `v2` greater than 0.**
