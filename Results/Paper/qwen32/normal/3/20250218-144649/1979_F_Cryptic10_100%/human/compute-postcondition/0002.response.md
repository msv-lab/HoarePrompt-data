The code snippet initializes `vx` as a set containing integers from 1 to the value of `n` (inclusive), where `n` is provided by the user input and is constrained to be between 2 and 10^5. The variable `ops` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n; `ops` is an empty list.**
