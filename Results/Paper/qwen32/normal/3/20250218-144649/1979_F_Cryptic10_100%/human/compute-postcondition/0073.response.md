To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `v1` and `v2` in this case. The loop iterates over the list `ops` in reverse order. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `v1` and `v2` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State Recap**: 
   - `vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers.
   - `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(a, b, a)` where `a` and `b` are the initial elements of the tuple in `ops`.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over `ops` in reverse order using `ops[::-1]`.
   - In the previous iteration, the tuple `(a, b, a)` was processed, so `v1` was `a` and `v2` was `b`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `ops` only contains one tuple, there are no more tuples to process in the reverse order.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again because there are no more elements in `ops` to iterate over.

Given this, there is no need to adjust `v1` and `v2` for another iteration because the loop will terminate after the current iteration. However, to adhere to the format requested, we can state the condition under which the loop would have continued if there were more elements.

State: **`vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers; `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(a, b, a)` where `a` and `b` are the initial elements of the tuple in `ops`. Since there are no more elements in `ops` to iterate over, the loop will not execute again.**

Since the loop will not execute again, we do not need to modify `v1` and `v2` for a non-existent next iteration. The state remains the same as described above. However, if we were to hypothetically continue the format for the next iteration (even though it doesn't exist), we could say:

State: **`vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers; `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(a, b, a)` where `a` and `b` are the initial elements of the tuple in `ops`. Since there are no more elements in `ops` to iterate over, the loop will not execute again.**

For clarity, the final state reflecting no further iterations is:

State: **`vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers; `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(a, b, a)` where `a` and `b` are the initial elements of the tuple in `ops`.**
