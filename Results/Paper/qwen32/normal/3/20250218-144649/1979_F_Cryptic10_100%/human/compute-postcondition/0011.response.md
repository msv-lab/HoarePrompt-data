The code snippet appends two tuples to the list `ops`. The first tuple is `(v3, 0)` and the second tuple is `(v1, 0)`. The values of `v3` and `v1` are determined by the function `q`, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. The only information given is that `v2` is the result of `q(n - 2)` and is less than or equal to 0, and `v3` is the result of `q(0)`. The set `vx` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v1` and `v3`; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)`, and `v2` is less than or equal to 0; `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`**

In simpler terms, the list `ops` now contains two tuples, `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
