The code snippet `vx.remove(v1)` removes the first occurrence of `v1` from the list `vx`. Given that `vx` must have at least 3 elements initially, after removing `v1`, `vx` will still have at least 2 elements. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` (if applicable) remain unchanged. `p1` and `p2` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements with `v1` removed, `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.**
