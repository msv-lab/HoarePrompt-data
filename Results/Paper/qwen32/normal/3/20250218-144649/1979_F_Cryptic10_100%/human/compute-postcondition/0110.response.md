The code snippet appends `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`; otherwise, it is appended to `p1`.

Given the initial state:
- `vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations.
- `ops` is a list with at least two tuples.
- `v1` is `v1_next`.
- `v2` is `v2_next`.

The code modifies either `p1` or `p2` by appending `v1` to it. The other variables (`vx`, `ops`, `v1_next`, `v2_next`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations; `ops` is a list with at least two tuples; `v1` is `v1_next`; `v2` is `v2_next`; `v1` is appended to `p2` if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `v1` is appended to `p1`.**
