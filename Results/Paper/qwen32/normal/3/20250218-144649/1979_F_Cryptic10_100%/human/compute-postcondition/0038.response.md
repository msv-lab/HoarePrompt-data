Let's break down the provided initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `p1` starts with the first two integers from `vx`.
- `p2` starts as an empty list.
- During loop iterations:
  - If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p1`.
  - If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p2`.

### Output State:
The print statement is:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reversing `p1`:**
   - `p1[::-1]` reverses the list `p1`. This means that the initial two integers from `vx` will be at the end of the reversed `p1`, and any `v1` values appended to `p1` will appear in reverse order.

2. **Concatenating `p1[::-1]` and `p2`:**
   - The reversed `p1` is concatenated with `p2`. This means all `v1` values that were appended to `p2` will follow the reversed `p1`.

3. **Formatting the Output:**
   - `' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))` converts each integer in the concatenated list to a string and joins them with spaces.
   - The final string is prefixed with `'!'`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a string that starts with `'!'` followed by the elements of the reversed `p1` list concatenated with the `p2` list, separated by spaces.

Output: **! [reversed elements of p1] [elements of p2] (where [reversed elements of p1] are the elements of p1 in reverse order and [elements of p2] are the elements appended to p2 during the loop)**
