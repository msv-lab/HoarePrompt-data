Postcondition: **`vx` has at least 2 elements after removing `v1`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the removal. If `v2 > 0`, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` appended to it. Otherwise, `vx` has at least 2 elements after removing `v1` and `v3`, where `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`; `ops` includes the additional tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `v1` and `v3` are such that only one of them (or neither) is excluded from the updated `vx`.**
