The code snippet `vx.remove(v3)` removes the element `v3` from the set `vx`. Since `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` for the first element, and `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to 3 excluding `v1`, the value of `v3` must be one of the integers 1, 2, or 3, and it cannot be `v1`.

After the removal, `vx` will no longer contain `v3`. The other variables (`ops`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, `v2`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to 3 excluding `v1` and `v3`, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` will contain the initial two integers from `vx` plus any additional integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` will contain any integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] == v2`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(1)`, and `v2` is less than or equal to 0; `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` for the first element.**
