Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are as they were at the end of the previous iteration, except that if `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` now includes `v1` appended to it; otherwise, `p1` now includes `v1` appended to it. `(v1, v2)` is the next element in `ops` when iterating in reverse order.**

In simpler terms: The last element of `p1` was checked against `v2`. If they were equal, `v1` was added to `p2`. Otherwise, `v1` was added to `p1`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
