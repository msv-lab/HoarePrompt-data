Let's carefully re-evaluate the logic of the program based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Problem Breakdown
The goal is to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, given the prices `a` (individual yogurt) and `b` (two yogurts on promotion).

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. **If `n` is odd**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, buy all yogurts individually.
   - Otherwise, buy as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and buy the remaining yogurt individually.
2. **If `n` is even**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, buy all yogurts individually.
   - Otherwise, buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.

### Verification with Test Cases
Let's verify the program logic with the provided example test cases.

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9), which is false.
   - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (1 * 9 = 9).
   - **Output: 9** (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9), which is false.
   - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (1 * 9 + 5 = 14).
   - **Output: 14** (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11), which is true.
   - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (5 * 3 = 15).
   - **Output: 15** (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11), which is true.
   - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (5 * 4 = 20).
   - **Output: 20** (Correct)

### Edge Case Analysis
Let's consider an edge case where buying pairs is more cost-effective than buying individually.

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9), which is false.
  - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (2 * 9 + 5 = 23).
  - **Expected Output: 22** (Buy 2 pairs for 18 burles and 1 yogurt for 4 burles)
  - **Actual Output: 23** (Incorrect)

### Conclusion
The program logic is flawed in handling cases where buying pairs is more cost-effective than buying individually, especially when `n` is odd. The logic should be adjusted to ensure that the minimum cost is always calculated correctly.

### Corrected Logic
For both even and odd `n`, the program should always compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually versus the cost of buying as many pairs as possible and the remaining yogurts individually.

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is inaccurate due to the incorrect handling of certain edge cases.

**Final: False**
