### Reasoning:

Let's carefully review the logic and the annotated code to ensure the program meets the problem requirements.

1. **Case 1: `n` is odd**
   - **Logic**: If `n` is odd, the program calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` if `b < 2 * a`. This means buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buying the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
   - **Annotation**: The annotations confirm that when `n` is odd, the program correctly computes `n // 2 * b + a` when `b < 2 * a` and `a * n` when `b >= 2 * a`.

2. **Case 2: `n` is even**
   - **Logic**: If `n` is even, the program calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` if `b < 2 * a`. This means buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
   - **Annotation**: The annotations confirm that when `n` is even, the program correctly computes `n // 2 * b` when `b < 2 * a` and `a * n` when `b >= 2 * a`.

3. **Edge Cases**
   - **Minimum Values**: `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`
     - Expected: `1` (since `n` is odd and `2 * a = b`, it should buy 1 yogurt at `a` burles).
     - Output: `1` (correct).
   - **Maximum Values**: `n = 100`, `a = 30`, `b = 30`
     - Expected: `1500` (since `2 * a = b`, it should buy 50 pairs at `b` burles each).
     - Output: `1500` (correct).
   - **Promotion Cheaper**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Expected: `14` (since `2 * a < b`, it should buy 2 yogurts at `a` burles each and 1 yogurt at `a` burles).
     - Output: `14` (correct).
   - **Promotion More Expensive**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Expected: `20` (since `2 * a > b`, it should buy 2 pairs at `b` burles each).
     - Output: `20` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The annotations and the logic of the program confirm that the program correctly handles all scenarios, including edge cases. The original assessment is accurate, and there are no discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs.

**Final: True**
