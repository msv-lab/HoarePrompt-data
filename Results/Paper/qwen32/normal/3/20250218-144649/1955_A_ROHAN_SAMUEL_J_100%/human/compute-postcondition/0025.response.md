The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are overwritten by the input values. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the input reading operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `2 * a < b`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The parity of `n` (odd or even) does not affect the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.**
