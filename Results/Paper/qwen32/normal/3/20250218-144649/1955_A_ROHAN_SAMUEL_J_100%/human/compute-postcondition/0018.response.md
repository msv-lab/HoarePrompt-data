To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The conditions related to `n`, `a`, and `b` are:
  - If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
  - If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n // 2 * b + a)
```

### Analysis:
- The expression `n // 2` computes the integer division of `n` by 2. This will give the number of times `b` is added to the result, scaled by the integer division of `n` by 2.
- The expression `n // 2 * b` calculates the product of the integer division of `n` by 2 and `b`.
- The final expression `n // 2 * b + a` adds `a` to the result of `n // 2 * b`.

### Output Description:
The output of the `print` statement is the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`. Since the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output this calculated value.

Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n, a, and b are integers read from the input)**
