The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, and it is not affected by the code snippet provided. The conditions related to the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are also not directly changed by the code snippet, but the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
