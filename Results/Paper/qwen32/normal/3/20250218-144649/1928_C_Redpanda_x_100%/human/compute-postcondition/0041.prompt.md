Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, the function is expected to generate values based on some list of primes and a dictionary factors, where `k` is an index within the bounds of the primes list. Additionally, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list. `rest` holds the value returned by `generate(k + 1)`
Code of the loop:
for factor in rest:
    prime_to_i = 1
    for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
        yield factor * prime_to_i
        prime_to_i *= prime


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)`, `prime_to_i` is `prime

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)` with at least one more element, `prime_to_i` is `prime^(factors[prime] + 1)`, and `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)` with at least one more element, `prime_to_i` is `prime^(factors[prime] + 1)`, and `factor` is the next element in the `rest` collection; values of `factor * prime`, `factor * prime^2`, ..., `factor * prime^(factors[prime] + 1)` have been yielded.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
