Postcondition: **`k` is a non-negative integer, and the function either yields 1 if `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, or generates and yields all possible values of `factor * prime`, `factor * prime^2`, ..., `factor * prime^(factors[prime] + 1)` for each `factor` in `rest` where `prime` is `primes[k]`, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` as a non-negative integer, and `rest` is an empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)` if `k` is not equal to the length of the `primes` list.**
