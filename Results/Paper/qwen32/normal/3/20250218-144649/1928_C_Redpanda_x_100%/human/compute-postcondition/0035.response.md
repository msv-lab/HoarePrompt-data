Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the `primes` list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)` with at least one more element, `prime_to_i` is `prime`, `factor` is the next element in the `rest` collection; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

A value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, but the values of the variables remain unchanged as the `yield` statement does not alter the state of the variables.
