To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to understand the value of `k` based on the given initial state.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the calculation of `k`.
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\). These variables are also not used in the calculation of `k`.
   - `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
   - `k` is defined as `abs(n - m)`, which means `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

2. **Value of `k`**:
   - `k` is simply the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The exact value depends on the specific values of `n` and `m` provided as input.

3. **Conditions Based on `k`**:
   - If `k` is a power of 2, no additional variables are introduced.
   - If `k` is not a power of 2 and `k` is odd, no additional variables are introduced.
   - If `k` is not a power of 2 and `k` is even, additional variables `l`, `p`, `f`, and `q` are introduced, but these do not affect the value of `k` itself.

Since the `print(k)` statement only outputs the value of `k`, we need to describe `k` in terms of `n` and `m`.

### Final Output:

Output: **abs(n - m)**
