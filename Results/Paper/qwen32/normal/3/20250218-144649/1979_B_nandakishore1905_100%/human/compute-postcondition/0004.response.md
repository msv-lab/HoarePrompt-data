Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
- `k` is defined as `abs(n - m)` and is a power of 2.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(k)
```

From the initial state, we know that `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and that `k` is a power of 2. The exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, but we know their difference will result in a power of 2.

Thus, the output will be the value of `k`, which is a power of 2.

Output: **k (where k is a power of 2)**
