Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `m` are each integers between 1 and 10^18, and the number of test cases satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input by the user. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state and not directly affected by the provided code snippet.
