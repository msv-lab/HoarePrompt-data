Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. Given the frequency of fireworks launches `a` and `b` for the two installations, and the visibility duration `m`, we need to calculate the maximum overlap of fireworks in the sky.

### Key Points

1. **Launch Times**: 
   - The first installation launches fireworks at times `a, 2a, 3a, ...`
   - The second installation launches fireworks at times `b, 2b, 3b, ...`
   
2. **Visibility Duration**:
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch, i.e., from launch time `x` to `x + m`.

3. **Overlap Calculation**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that overlap at any given time.

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`.

#### Breakdown of the Program

- `m // a`: Counts the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that are visible within the first `m` minutes.
- `m // b`: Counts the number of fireworks launched by the second installation that are visible within the first `m` minutes.
- `+ 2`: This part of the formula does not align with the problem's requirements. It seems to be an incorrect assumption or an arbitrary addition.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the overlap of the intervals defined by the launch times and visibility durations. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of the overlap and then calculating the maximum overlap within one period.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
