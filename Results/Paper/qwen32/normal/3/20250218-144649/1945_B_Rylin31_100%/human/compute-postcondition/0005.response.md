The code provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet, and `i` is incremented by 1 outside of the provided code snippet, so we only update `a`, `b`, and `m` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1**.

In natural language, this means that `t` retains its initial value, `a`, `b`, and `m` are now the three integers that were read from the input, and `i` has been incremented by 1.
