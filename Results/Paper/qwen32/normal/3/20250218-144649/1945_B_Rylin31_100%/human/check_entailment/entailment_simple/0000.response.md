Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is not sufficient to determine the correct answer. 

To find the correct solution, we need to consider the overlap of the visibility intervals of fireworks from both installations. Specifically, we need to find the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals that can be active at any given time.

The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, and then calculating how many fireworks from each installation are in the sky at the same time within a period of LCM(a, b). The formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is derived from the principle of inclusion and exclusion over the intervals.

Here is the correct approach:
1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of fireworks from the first installation within one LCM period.
3. Determine the number of fireworks from the second installation within one LCM period.
4. Determine the number of fireworks from both installations within one LCM period by considering their overlap.
5. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the sum of fireworks from both installations minus the overlap.

The provided program does not follow this logic; hence, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
