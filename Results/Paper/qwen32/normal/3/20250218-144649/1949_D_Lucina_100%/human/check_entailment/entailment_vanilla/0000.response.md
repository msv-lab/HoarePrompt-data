Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of scenarios.
   - It then reads `n` lines, each containing `n` characters representing the transition videos between scenarios. Each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S':**
   - Two arrays `a` and `b` are used to count the number of 'F' (funny) and 'S' (scary) videos for each scenario.
   - For each character in the input, if it's 'F', both `a[i]` and `a[j]` are incremented. If it's 'S', both `b[i]` and `b[j]` are incremented.

3. **Classifying Scenarios:**
   - The program creates two lists, `sa` and `sb`, to store scenarios that have only 'F' videos and only 'S' videos, respectively.
   - If the length of `sa` (scenarios with only 'F') is greater than or equal to the length of `sb` (scenarios with only 'S'), it appends all undecided scenarios (where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0) to `sa`.
   - Otherwise, it appends all undecided scenarios to `sb`.

4. **Assigning Remaining Videos:**
   - If `sa` is longer, the program assigns 'F' to undecided videos for scenarios in `sa` up to `n // 4 - 1` and assigns 'S' to all other undecided videos.
   - If `sb` is longer, the program assigns 'S' to undecided videos for scenarios in `sb` up to `n // 4 - 1` and assigns 'F' to all other undecided videos.
   - The program then prints the final transition plan.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Logic for Assigning Videos:**
   - The program uses a threshold of `n // 4 - 1` to assign videos, which does not align with the problem's requirement that no more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` videos of the same type should appear consecutively.
   - The logic for assigning 'F' and 'S' based on the length of `sa` and `sb` does not ensure that the constraint on consecutive videos is met for all permutations of scenarios.

2. **Handling of Undecided Videos:**
   - The program does not ensure that the assignment of undecided videos will prevent any permutation from having more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive videos of the same type.
   - The approach is too simplistic and does not account for the complex interdependencies between the scenarios.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly ensure that no more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` transition videos of the same type will appear consecutively for all permutations of scenarios. The logic for assigning undecided videos is flawed and does not guarantee the required constraint.

**Correctness: False**
