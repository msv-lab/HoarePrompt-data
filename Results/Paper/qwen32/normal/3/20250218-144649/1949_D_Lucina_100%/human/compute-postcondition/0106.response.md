The code appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`. However, `sb` is not defined in the initial state, so we can infer that `sb` is initialized as an empty list before this operation. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition for defining `sa` is not met because `a[i]` is 3 (which is greater than 0) and `b[i]` is 2 (which is not equal to 0), so `sa` is not defined.

Output State: **`n` is 4, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `i` is 1, `sb` is [1]**.
