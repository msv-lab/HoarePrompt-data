The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` in the list `a` by 1. The values of `x`, `n`, `xx`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The character at position `j - 1` in `x` is still 'F'. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`x` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged; `a[i]` is increased by 1; the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F'.**
