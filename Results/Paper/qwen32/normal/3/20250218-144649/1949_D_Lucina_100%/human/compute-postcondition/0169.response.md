The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `j`, or `xx[i][j - 1]`, and it does not alter the conditions specified in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by `xx[n + 1][0]`. Otherwise, `nx` is a string ending with 'F' if `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is the original `nx` with 'S' appended. Additionally, `nx` now has 'S' appended to it.**
