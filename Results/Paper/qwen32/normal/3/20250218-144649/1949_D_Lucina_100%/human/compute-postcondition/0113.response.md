The code appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`, so the output state will reflect that `i` has been added to `sa`. The values of `n`, `a[i]`, and `b[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a[i]` is 0, `b[i]` is 0, `sa` contains `i`**.
