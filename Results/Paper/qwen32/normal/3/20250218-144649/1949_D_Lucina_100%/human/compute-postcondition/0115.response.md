The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n + 1):`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration is `n` is 3, we need to determine the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been 3 (since the loop runs from 1 to `n` inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 4, but since `n` is 3, the loop will not execute again because `i` (which would be 4) is not less than `n + 1` (which is 4).

However, if we are to adjust the state to reflect the start of the next iteration assuming `n` could potentially change or if we are to strictly follow the loop mechanics:

State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 4**

But since the loop condition would fail with this state, the loop will not execute again with `n` being 3. If the task is to strictly adhere to the next iteration state without changing `n`, then we should reflect the state just before the loop terminates:

State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 3**

This state reflects the condition right before the loop exits, where `i` is 3 and `n` is 3, making `i` not less than `n + 1` (which is 4), thus the loop terminates.
