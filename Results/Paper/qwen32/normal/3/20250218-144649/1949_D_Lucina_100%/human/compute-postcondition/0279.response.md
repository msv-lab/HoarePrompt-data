The code attempts to concatenate the string `'S'` to the variable `nx`. However, the initial state does not mention `nx`, which means `nx` is undefined before this operation. Since `nx` is not defined, this code would raise a `NameError` in Python. Therefore, the operation cannot be completed as described.

If we assume that `nx` was intended to be a string variable and was perhaps mistakenly omitted from the initial state, and if we hypothetically consider `nx` to be an empty string initially, then the operation would result in `nx` being `'S'`.

Given the provided information and the assumption that `nx` was meant to be an empty string, the Output State would be:

Output State: **`n` is 3, `j` is 4, `nx` is `'S'`**.
