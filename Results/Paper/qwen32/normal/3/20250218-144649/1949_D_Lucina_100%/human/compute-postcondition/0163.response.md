The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `nx`, we can only state that `nx` will have 'S' appended to it. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `nx` is the original `nx` with 'S' appended**.
