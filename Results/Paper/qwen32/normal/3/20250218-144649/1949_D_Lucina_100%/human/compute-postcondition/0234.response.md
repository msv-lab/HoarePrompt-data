The code snippet `nx += 'F'` is attempting to concatenate the string 'F' to the variable `nx`. However, in the initial state provided, there is no variable named `nx`. Therefore, this operation will result in a NameError as `nx` is not defined. 

Given the task constraints and the requirement to strictly follow the format, it is not possible to provide an updated state for `nx` since it does not exist. We should mention this error in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and a NameError occurs because `nx` is not defined.**
