Postcondition: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `a[i]` which is 1 and `a[j + 1]` which is 2 if the character at index `j` in `x` is 'F', or `a[j + 1]` which is 3 if the character at index `j` in `x` is 'F' and the if condition is true, `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `b[j + 1]` which is 2 if `j + 1` is the same as `i` or `b[j + 1]` is 1 if `j + 1` is different from `i` if the character at position `j` in `x` is 'S', or `b[j + 1]` which is 3 if `j + 1` is the same as `i` or `b[j + 1]` is 2 if `j + 1` is different from `i` if the character at position `j` in `x` is 'S' and the if condition is false. If the character at position `j` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', `b[j + 1]` is 1 if `j + 1` is the same as `i` or `b[j + 1]` remains 0 if `j + 1` is different from `i`. If the character at position `j` in `x` is 'S', `b[i]` is incremented by 1, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `x` is the user's input string, `j` is `j + 1`. Additionally, if `x[j - 1] == 'S'`, `b[i]` is incremented by 1 and `b[j]` is incremented by 1.**
