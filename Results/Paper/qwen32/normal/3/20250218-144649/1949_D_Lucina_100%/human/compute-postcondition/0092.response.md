Postcondition: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is []. The current index `i` is such that `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`.**

In simpler terms: After entering the if condition, `n` is 3, `a` remains [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` remains [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` remains ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is still [], and `sb` is still []. The current index `i` satisfies the condition that `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0.
