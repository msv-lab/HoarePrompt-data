The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `nx`, we can only say that it will have 'F' appended to it. The variables `sa`, `n`, and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `nx` has 'F' appended to it.**
