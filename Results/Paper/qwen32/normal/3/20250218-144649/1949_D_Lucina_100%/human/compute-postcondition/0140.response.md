The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3**
