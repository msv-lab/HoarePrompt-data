Postcondition: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `b[j]` which is 2 if `j` is the same as `i` or `b[j]` is 1 if `j` is different from `i` if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S'. `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `x` is the user's input string, and the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is not 'F'. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is not 'S', there are no changes to `a`, `b`, or `xx`.**
