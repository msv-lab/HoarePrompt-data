The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement `for j in range(1, n + 1):`, `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which indicates that the outer loop (if there is one) has finished, or `i` has been set to `n + 1` for some reason. However, since we are only concerned with the state of the loop head for the given `for` loop, we focus on `j`.

Given that `j` has reached a value that caused the loop to end in the previous iteration, we need to adjust `j` to the next value it should take to start the next iteration of the loop.

Since `j` was at a value that caused the loop to end, it must have been equal to `n + 1`. To start the next iteration, `j` should be reset to the starting value of the loop, which is 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
