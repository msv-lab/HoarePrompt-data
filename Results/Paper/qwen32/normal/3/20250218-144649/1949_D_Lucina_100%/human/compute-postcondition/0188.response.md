Output State: **`nx` is a string with 'F' appended to it, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` (before appending 'F') contains the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` (before appending 'F') is 'F' if either `i` or `j` (or both) is present in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` (before appending 'F') is 'S', `j` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, 'F' has been added to the end of the string `nx`. All other conditions and values remain the same as described in the initial state.
