The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is at least 1. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 2. The value of `n` does not change in each iteration, so it remains at least 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 2 and `n` should be at least 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
