Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into two subsequences. The current implementation seems to be attempting to count the number of times a "reset" is needed when iterating through the array, but it does not actually split the array into two subsequences in an optimal way to minimize the penalty.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Test Case:
```
1
4
4 3 2 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
0
```

### Explanation of the Expected Output:
In this case, the optimal way to split the array is to put all elements in one subsequence and leave the other subsequence empty. Since the array is strictly decreasing, the penalty for this subsequence is 0. Thus, the total penalty is 0.

### Actual Output of the Program:
The program will output `3` for this test case because it will count the number of times a "reset" is needed, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
The program is not correctly implementing the logic to split the array into two subsequences to minimize the penalty. The logic should consider how to optimally split the array to minimize the number of increasing subsequences in both subsequences. The current logic does not ensure that the split is optimal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
