To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the function call `moves = func_1(nodes, start)` on the existing variables. The code does not specify the implementation of `func_1`, so we can only assume that `func_1` takes `nodes` and `start` as arguments and returns a value assigned to `moves`. Given this, the only variable that will be directly affected is `moves`, which will hold the return value of `func_1`.

The rest of the variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, `edges`, `empty`, `i`, and `leaves`) remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, `start` is the integer input from the user, `n` is the first integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, and `leaves` is a deque containing all keys from `nodes` that have a single value; `moves` is the return value of `func_1(nodes, start)`**.
