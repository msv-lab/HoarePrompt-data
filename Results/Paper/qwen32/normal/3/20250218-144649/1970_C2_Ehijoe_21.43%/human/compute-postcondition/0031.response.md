Postcondition: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, `start` is the integer input from the user, `n` is the first integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, and `leaves` is a deque containing all keys from `nodes` that have a single value; `moves` is the return value of `func_1(nodes, start)`, and there is at least one element in `moves` that is an odd integer.**
