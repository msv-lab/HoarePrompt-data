nodes is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the neighbors of a node in a tree with n nodes (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), start is an integer representing the starting node where 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and parent is an optional parameter used to keep track of the parent node during the DFS traversal, initialized to None.
