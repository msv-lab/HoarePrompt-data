    #The program returns the list `distances` which contains all the incremented distances obtained from the recursive calls to `func_1` for each neighbor of the `start` node, excluding the `parent` node.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates distances from a starting node in a graph represented by a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors. It avoids revisiting the parent node and returns a list of distances. If the starting node has only one neighbor which is the parent, it returns `[0]`. Otherwise, it returns a list of incremented distances from recursive calls to its neighbors, excluding the parent.

If there is at least one element in `moves` that is an odd integer, then there is at least one odd integer in `moves`. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function constructs a graph from input data representing nodes and edges, identifies leaf nodes, and determines a starting node. It then computes a series of moves using another function (`func_1`). Based on whether any of these moves are odd, it prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
