The code snippet provided initializes a deque named `leaves`. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, `edges`, `empty`, `i`). Therefore, the only change in the state is the creation of the `leaves` deque, which is initially empty.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, with all `u` and `v` pairs added from the input; `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the first integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `leaves` is an empty deque.**
