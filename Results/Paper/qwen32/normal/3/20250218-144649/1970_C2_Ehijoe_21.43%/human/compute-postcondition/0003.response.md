The code snippet `nodes = defaultdict(list)` changes the type of the `nodes` variable from a dictionary to a `defaultdict` where the default value for each key is an empty list. The other variables (`start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True.**
