The code snippet provided only initializes a boolean variable `empty` to `True`. This does not affect the other variables `nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, or `edges`. Therefore, the values of `nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, and `edges` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True.**
