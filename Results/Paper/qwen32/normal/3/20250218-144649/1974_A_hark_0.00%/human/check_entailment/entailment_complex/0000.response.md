### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. The provided code consists of three functions, `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. Let's analyze each function to see if they collectively solve the problem correctly.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To return the smaller of two integers.
- **Implementation**: It correctly returns the smaller of two integers `a` and `b`.
- **Relevance**: While `func_1` is implemented correctly, it is not used anywhere in the given code, so it does not contribute to solving the problem.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To calculate the minimum number of screens required for a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
- **Implementation**:
  - If both `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons) are greater than 0:
    - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2` (the minimum number of screens needed for 2x2 icons).
    - It adjusts the number of 1x1 icons by the formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` (this formula is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements).
    - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the adjusted `x / 15` plus 1 if `x` is greater than 0.
    - It prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
  - If only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`.
  - If only `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`.
  - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.
- **Relevance**: The formula used to adjust `x` and calculate `bxsfory1` is incorrect. The logic does not correctly account for the placement of 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons. Specifically, the formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect and does not reflect the actual space occupied by 2x2 icons.

#### Function `func_3`:
- **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases.
- **Implementation**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2` for each test case.
- **Relevance**: This function correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_2` for each one.

### Conclusion:
The main issue lies in the implementation of `func_2`. The formula used to calculate the number of screens required is incorrect. The logic does not properly account for the placement of 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
