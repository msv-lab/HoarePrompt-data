You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))

#Function 3:

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it processes two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= x, y <= 99) by calling `func_2`. The overall effect is that for each test case, some action is performed (as defined in `func_2`), although the specific action is not detailed in the provided code.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place x 1x1 icons and y 2x2 icons. The program provided consists of three functions, but the main logic is in `func_2()`.

Here's a breakdown of what `func_2()` is supposed to do:
1. **Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons (`y`)**: Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a single screen is 3 (since 4*3 = 12 cells, leaving 3 cells unused). Therefore, the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons is `math.ceil(y / 3)`.
2. **Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons**: After placing the 2x2 icons, there will be some cells left on the screens. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so `y * 4` cells are occupied by 2x2 icons. The number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons can exceed the number of cells available on the screens, so we need to calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. **Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons (`x`)**: After accounting for the 2x2 icons, we need to place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells. If there are not enough cells left, we need additional screens. The number of additional screens needed is `math.ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)`, where `remaining_cells` is the number of cells left after placing the 2x2 icons.

The provided code has some logical errors:
1. The calculation of `bxsfory` is incorrect. It should be `math.ceil(y / 3)` instead of `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
2. The calculation of remaining cells and additional screens for 1x1 icons is incorrect. The code incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` from `x` and then adds `y * 4`, which does not make sense.
3. The logic for handling the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons is incorrect.

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:
- Input: `x = 1`, `y = 3`
- Expected output: `1` (since 3 2x2 icons can fit on one screen, and there will be 3 cells left, which can fit 1 1x1 icon)
- Program output: `2` (incorrect)

Given the above analysis, the program does not handle all cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons and the remaining cells after placing them. It also incorrectly calculates the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons. The provided test case `x = 1`, `y = 3` demonstrates that the program does not work as expected.
