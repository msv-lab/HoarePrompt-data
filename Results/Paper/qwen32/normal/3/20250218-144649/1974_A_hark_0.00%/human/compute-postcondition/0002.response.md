To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_2()` does. However, since the code snippet provided does not define `func_2()` or specify its behavior, we cannot definitively determine how the variables `t`, `x`, and `y` will be affected. 

Given the lack of definition for `func_2()`, we must assume that the function does not alter the values of `t`, `x`, or `y` unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99**.
