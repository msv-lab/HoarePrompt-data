Reasoning: 

To determine if the program is correct, we need to ensure that the logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on the 5x3 grid screens.

Let's analyze the logic inside `func_2`:

1. **If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place `y` 2x2 icons, considering that each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (as 2x2 icons take up 4 cells each and the screen has 15 cells).
   - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line seems incorrect. The intention should be to calculate the remaining number of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. The correct way would be to calculate the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons and subtract that from the total cells, then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining cells. However, the current formula does not achieve this.
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The `+1` seems unnecessary and incorrect because it adds an extra screen even if no additional 1x1 icons are needed.
   - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This prints the total number of screens needed.

2. **If `x == 0` and `y > 0`:**
   - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.

3. **If `x > 0` and `y == 0`:**
   - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `x` 1x1 icons.

4. **If both `x` and `y` are 0:**
   - `print(0)`: This correctly outputs 0 screens needed.

The logic in `func_2` is flawed, particularly in the handling of `x` and `y` when both are greater than 0. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not correctly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. The logic for `bxsfory1` also appears incorrect as it adds an extra screen unnecessarily.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required.

Correctness: **False**
