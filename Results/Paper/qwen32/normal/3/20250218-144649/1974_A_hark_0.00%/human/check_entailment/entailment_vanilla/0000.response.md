Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to fit the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Grid Size and Icon Placement:**
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which has a total of 15 cells.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

2. **Constraints and Input:**
   - There are `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, there are `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons.

3. **Logic in the Program:**

   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`:** 
     - This function returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. It is not used in the program, so we can ignore it for now.

   - **Function `func_2()`:**
     - Reads two integers `x` and `y` from input.
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - `bxsfory` is calculated as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This is the number of screens needed if we place 2x2 icons optimally (two 2x2 icons per screen).
       - `x` is then recalculated as `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This step seems incorrect because it subtracts 15 times the number of screens for 2x2 icons and adds 4 times the number of 2x2 icons. This does not make sense in the context of the problem.
       - `bxsfory1` is calculated as `0` if `x <= 0`, otherwise it is the ceiling of `x / 15` plus 1. This step is also incorrect because it adds 1 to the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is not necessary.
       - The total number of screens is then `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
     - If `x == 0` and `y > 0`, it calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons only.
     - If `x > 0` and `y == 0`, it calculates the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons only.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it outputs `0`.

   - **Function `func_3()`:**
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - Calls `func_2()` `t` times.

### Correctness:

The logic in `func_2()` is incorrect for several reasons:
1. The recalculation of `x` after placing 2x2 icons is incorrect.
2. The addition of 1 to `bxsfory1` is incorrect.
3. The placement of 2x2 icons and 1x1 icons is not handled optimally.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Place 2x2 Icons First:**
   - Place as many 2x2 icons as possible on a screen. Each screen can fit a maximum of 2 2x2 icons.
   - Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons: `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`.

2. **Place Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 - 4 * (y % 2)`.
   - Calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed: `remaining_x = x - 4 * (y - y % 2)`.
   - Calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(remaining_x / remaining_cells)`.

3. **Total Screens:**
   - Total screens needed = `bxsfory + bxsfory1`.

Given the incorrect logic in the provided program, the program is not correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
