The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the input, where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions of `x` and `y`. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it computes a specific formula involving `x` and `y` and prints the result. If either `x` or `y` is 0, it prints a simpler value derived from the non-zero variable or 0 if both are 0.
