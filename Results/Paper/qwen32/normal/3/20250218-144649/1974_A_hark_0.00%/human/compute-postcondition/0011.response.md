Given the initial state:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x \leq 99\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 99\).
- The current value of `x` is greater than 0.
- The current value of `y` is 0.
- At least one of `x` or `y` is 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.

From this, we can deduce:
- Since `y` is 0, the condition "at least one of `x` or `y` is 0" is satisfied.
- The condition "it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0" is also satisfied since `y` is 0.

Thus, `x` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

To determine the output, we need to evaluate `math.ceil(x / 15)` based on the range of possible values for `x` (which is \(1 \leq x \leq 99\)).

- When `x` is 1, `x / 15` is approximately 0.0667, and `math.ceil(0.0667)` is 1.
- When `x` is 15, `x / 15` is 1.0, and `math.ceil(1.0)` is 1.
- When `x` is 16, `x / 15` is approximately 1.0667, and `math.ceil(1.0667)` is 2.
- This pattern continues, and we can generalize that the result of `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`.

Given the range of `x` from 1 to 99, the possible values for `math.ceil(x / 15)` are from 1 to 7 (since \(99 / 15 \approx 6.6\), and `math.ceil(6.6)` is 7).

However, without the exact value of `x`, we can only describe the output in terms of the range of possible values it can take based on the given constraints.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99)**
