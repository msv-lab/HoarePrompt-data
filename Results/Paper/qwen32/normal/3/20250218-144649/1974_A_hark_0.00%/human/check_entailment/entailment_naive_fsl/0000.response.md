Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place x 1x1 icons and y 2x2 icons. The program provided consists of three functions, but the main logic is in `func_2()`.

Here's a breakdown of what `func_2()` is supposed to do:
1. **Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons (`y`)**: Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a single screen is 3 (since 4*3 = 12 cells, leaving 3 cells unused). Therefore, the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons is `math.ceil(y / 3)`.
2. **Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons**: After placing the 2x2 icons, there will be some cells left on the screens. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so `y * 4` cells are occupied by 2x2 icons. The number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons can exceed the number of cells available on the screens, so we need to calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. **Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons (`x`)**: After accounting for the 2x2 icons, we need to place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells. If there are not enough cells left, we need additional screens. The number of additional screens needed is `math.ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)`, where `remaining_cells` is the number of cells left after placing the 2x2 icons.

The provided code has some logical errors:
1. The calculation of `bxsfory` is incorrect. It should be `math.ceil(y / 3)` instead of `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
2. The calculation of remaining cells and additional screens for 1x1 icons is incorrect. The code incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` from `x` and then adds `y * 4`, which does not make sense.
3. The logic for handling the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons is incorrect.

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:
- Input: `x = 1`, `y = 3`
- Expected output: `1` (since 3 2x2 icons can fit on one screen, and there will be 3 cells left, which can fit 1 1x1 icon)
- Program output: `2` (incorrect)

Given the above analysis, the program does not handle all cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons and the remaining cells after placing them. It also incorrectly calculates the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons. The provided test case `x = 1`, `y = 3` demonstrates that the program does not work as expected.
