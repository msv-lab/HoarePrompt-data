Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Example

Input

    11
    
    1 1
    
    7 2
    
    12 4
    
    0 3
    
    1 0
    
    8 1
    
    0 0
    
    2 0
    
    15 0
    
    8 2
    
    0 9

Output

Note

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts two integer parameters and returns the smaller of the two.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the input, where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions of `x` and `y`. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it computes a specific formula involving `x` and `y` and prints the result. If either `x` or `y` is 0, it prints a simpler value derived from the non-zero variable or 0 if both are 0.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it processes two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= x, y <= 99) by calling `func_2`. The overall effect is that for each test case, some action is performed (as defined in `func_2`), although the specific action is not detailed in the provided code.
