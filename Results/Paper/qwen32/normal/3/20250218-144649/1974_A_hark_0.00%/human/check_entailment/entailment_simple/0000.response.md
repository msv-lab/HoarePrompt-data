### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a 5x3 grid.

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is defined but never used in the provided code. It simply returns the smaller of two integers. Since it's not used, we can ignore it for this analysis.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles the logic for a single test case. It reads the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and 2x2 icons (`y`), and then calculates the minimum number of screens required based on the following logic:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, which represents the minimum number of screens needed just to place the 2x2 icons, considering that each screen can fit at most 2 of these icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 5x3 grid has 15 cells).
     - It then updates `x` to account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect and doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. It seems to be an attempt to adjust `x` based on the space used by the 2x2 icons, but this adjustment is not correct.
     - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the remaining `x` divided by 15, plus 1 if `x` is greater than 0. This is intended to determine the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - It prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0, it simply prints the ceiling of `y / 2`, since each screen can fit at most 2 of the 2x2 icons.
   - If only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`, since each screen can fit up to 15 of the 1x1 icons.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0, as no screens are needed.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should instead calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and determine how many 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space.
- The logic for calculating the remaining space and the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons is flawed.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the logic in `func_2`, the program is not correct. The provided code does not accurately calculate the minimum number of screens needed for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
