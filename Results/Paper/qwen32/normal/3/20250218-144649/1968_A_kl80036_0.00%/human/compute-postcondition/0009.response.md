The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `i` is incremented by 1. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer**.
