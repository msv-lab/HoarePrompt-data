Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the provided code snippet, it's mentioned for completeness).
3. `x` is an input integer.
4. `y` is calculated as `x // 2` (integer division of `x` by 2).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(y)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `y` is the result of the integer division of `x` by 2. This means `y` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `x / 2`.
- The exact value of `y` depends on the value of `x`, which is not explicitly provided. However, we know that `y` is calculated as `x // 2`.

### Output:
The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y`, which is `x // 2`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `y`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `y` which is `x // 2`.

Output: **y (where y is the integer division of x by 2)**
