Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is the value of the user's input; `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`, and `count` is not equal to 0. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the if part is executed. Otherwise, if `count` is equal to 2, the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is either not immediately followed by another '1', or it is immediately followed by another '1'. Additionally, `count` can also be less than 2 or an odd number.**
