Reasoning:  
The provided Python program and its annotated state do not match. The problem description and the code provided are for a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` which scans directories, checks folder names within a specified range, and generates specific files for HTML files found within those directories. The annotated program, however, describes a completely different function `func` that deals with counting '1's in strings and printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. Since the annotated program does not correspond to the provided code, the correctness of the given program cannot be determined based on the annotated program's state.

Given that the annotated program is not related to the provided code, we cannot confirm its correctness based on the provided annotations.

Correctness: **False**
