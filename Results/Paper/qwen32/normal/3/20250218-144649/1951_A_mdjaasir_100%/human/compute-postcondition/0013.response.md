The `print('YES')` statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count`. The print statement is a simple output statement that does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('YES')` statement is a direct output statement.
2. It does not reference any variables or perform any calculations.
3. The string 'YES' is explicitly provided in the print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
