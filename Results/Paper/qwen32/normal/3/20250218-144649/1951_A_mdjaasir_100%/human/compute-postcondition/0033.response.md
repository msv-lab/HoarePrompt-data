Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user's input, and `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the state of the variables remains as described. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count`.**
