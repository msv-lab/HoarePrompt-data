The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `count`), but none of these variables are used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
