The `print('NO')` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count` described in the initial state.

Here is the breakdown:
- The `print` function is called with the string `'NO'` as its argument.
- This means that the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
