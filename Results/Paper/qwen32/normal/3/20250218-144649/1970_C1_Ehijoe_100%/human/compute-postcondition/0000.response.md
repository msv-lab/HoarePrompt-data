The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. Given the initial state, `n` is already an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and `t` is an integer such that t = 1. The code does not change the values of `n` and `t` other than reading them from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n representing the starting nodes for each round. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.**
