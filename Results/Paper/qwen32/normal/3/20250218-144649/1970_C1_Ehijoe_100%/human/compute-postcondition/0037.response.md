The code snippet `curr = nodes[curr][1]` updates the value of `curr` to the second element of the list stored in `nodes[curr]`. Given the initial state, `nodes[curr]` is a list with at least two elements because `curr` is `nodes[s][0]` and `nodes[curr][0]` equals `prev`, implying that `nodes[curr]` has at least two elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the elements `[s, curr]`, `prev` is `curr`, `curr` is `nodes[curr][1]`.**

In natural language: The value of `curr` is updated to the second element of the list stored in `nodes[curr]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
