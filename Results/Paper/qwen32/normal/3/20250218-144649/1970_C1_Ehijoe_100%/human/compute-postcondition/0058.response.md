The code snippet provided assigns the result of `int(input())` to the variable `start`. This means that `start` will take on the integer value provided by the user input.

Since the other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`, `i`, `ends`, `s`, `e`, `tree`, `prev`, `curr`) are not modified by this code snippet, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing all nodes from `s` to `e`, inclusive, with `e` appended again, `prev` is `e`, `curr` is `e`, `start` is an input integer.**
