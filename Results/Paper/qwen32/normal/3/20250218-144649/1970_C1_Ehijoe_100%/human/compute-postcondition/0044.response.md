The given code snippet is `prev = curr`. This line assigns the current value of `curr` to the variable `prev`. No other variables are modified in this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5
- `t` is 1
- `edges` is an empty list
- `empty` is `True`
- `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree
- `i` is n-2
- `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1
- `s` is the first element of `ends`
- `e` is the second element of `ends`
- `tree` is a list containing the elements `[s, curr, curr]`
- `prev` is `curr`
- `curr` is an element in `nodes[prev]` but not equal to `e`

After executing `prev = curr`, the value of `prev` is updated to be the current value of `curr`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the elements `[s, curr, curr]`, `prev` is `curr`, `curr` is an element in `nodes[prev]` but not equal to `e`**.
