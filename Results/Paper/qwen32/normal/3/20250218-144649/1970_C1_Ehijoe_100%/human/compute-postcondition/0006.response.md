The code snippet appends the value `v` to the list associated with the key `u` in the `nodes` dictionary. Since `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists, if `u` is not already a key in `nodes`, it will be added with an empty list as its value, and then `v` will be appended to this list.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `nodes`. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `edges`, `empty`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v]`, `i` is 0.**
