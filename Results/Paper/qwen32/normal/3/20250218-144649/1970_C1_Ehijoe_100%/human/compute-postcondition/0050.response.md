The code snippet `tree.append(curr)` appends the current value of `curr` to the `tree` list. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the `tree` list now contains four elements: the initial three elements `[s, curr, curr]` plus the newly appended `curr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the elements `[s, curr, curr, curr]`, `prev` is `curr`, `curr` is not equal to `e`**.
