The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the for loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u]`, `i` is 1**
