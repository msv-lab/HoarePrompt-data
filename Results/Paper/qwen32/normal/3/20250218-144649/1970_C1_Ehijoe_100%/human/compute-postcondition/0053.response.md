The code provided is simply `prev = curr`. This line assigns the value of `curr` to `prev`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `prev` now holds the value of `curr`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the elements `[s, curr, curr, curr]`, `prev` is `curr`, `curr` is not equal to `e`**.
