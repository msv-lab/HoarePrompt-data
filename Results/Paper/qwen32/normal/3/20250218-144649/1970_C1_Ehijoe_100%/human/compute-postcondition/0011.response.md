The code snippet `nodes[v].append(u)` modifies the `nodes` defaultdict by appending `u` to the list that `nodes[v]` points to. Given the initial state, `nodes[v]` initially contains `[u]`. After appending `u` to `nodes[v]`, `nodes[v]` will contain `[u, u]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v, v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u, u]`, `i` is 1**.
