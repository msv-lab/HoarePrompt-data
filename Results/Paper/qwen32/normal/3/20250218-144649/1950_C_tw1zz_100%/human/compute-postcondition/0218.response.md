The code snippet assigns the string 'AM' to the variable `time`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the new hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the new minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `h1` is '07'; `time` is 'AM'**.
