The code snippet reads a string input in the format "h:m", splits it by the colon, and assigns the hour part to `h` and the minute part to `m`, both as strings. The variable `t` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time; `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time.**
