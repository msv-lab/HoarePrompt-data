The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which should be the number of iterations `t`. 

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1440`, the loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a value within this range. Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the variables inside the loop head, but rather the input should reflect the value of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `int(input())` returns `t`**
