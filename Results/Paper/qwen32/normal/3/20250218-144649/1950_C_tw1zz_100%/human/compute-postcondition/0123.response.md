To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the initial state and how the variables `h1`, `m`, and `time` are derived based on the value of `h`.

The key points to consider are:
- `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string.
- `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string.
- `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h`.

Let's break down the possible values of `h` and how they map to `h1` and `time`:

1. If `h` is '01' to '11', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
2. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
3. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is `h - 12` and `time` is 'PM'.
4. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
5. If `h` is any other value (which is not possible given the constraints 1 <= t <= 1440, as `h` would always be a valid hour in 24-hour format), `h1` and `time` remain unchanged.

Given this, the print statement `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')` will output the modified hour (`h1`), followed by a colon, the minutes (`m`), a space, and the period of the day (`time`).

Since the exact value of `h` and `m` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of how they are derived from `h`.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the modified hour based on h, m is the minute part of the input time, and time is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of h)**

However, if we assume a specific value for `h` and `m` to provide a concrete example, let's consider `h = '14'` and `m = '30'`:

- For `h = '14'`, `h1` becomes '02' and `time` becomes 'PM'.
- The print statement will output `02:30 PM`.

But since the exact values are not provided, the general output format is:

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the modified hour based on h, m is the minute part of the input time, and time is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of h)**
