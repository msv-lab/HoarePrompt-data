Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of time entries (where 1 <= t <= 1440). For each of the following `t` lines, it receives a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a time. The function returns the count of valid time entries. A valid time entry is one where "hh" is between 00 and 23 and "mm" is between 00 and 59.**
