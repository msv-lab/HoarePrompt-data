Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the hour is '00'. The code correctly converts '00:00' to '12:00 AM', but it does not handle other hours correctly when they are less than 10. For example, '07:30' should be converted to '07:30 AM', but the current code will convert it to '7:30 AM' (missing the leading zero). This is because the code does not properly handle the conversion of hours that are single digits.

Additionally, the code is repetitive and can be simplified to avoid these issues. Here is a corrected version of the code for reference:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = input().split(':')
        h = int(h)
        if h == 0:
            h1 = 12
            time = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            h1 = h
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h1 = 12
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            h1 = h - 12
            time = 'PM'
        print(f"{h1:02}:{m} {time}")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version, the code handles the conversion more efficiently and correctly formats the hour to always have two digits, ensuring that the output matches the problem description exactly.
