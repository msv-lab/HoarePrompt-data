The provided code snippet reads a new time input in the format `h:m` and updates the variables `h` and `m` with the new hour and minute parts of the input time, respectively. The initial values of `h` and `m` are overwritten by the new input values. The variables `t`, `m1`, `h1`, and `time` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the new hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the new minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `h1` is '01' if `h` is '01', '02' if `h` is '02', '03' if `h` is '03', '04' if `h` is '04', '05' if `h` is '05', '06' if `h` is '06', '07' if `h` is '07', '08' if `h` is '08', '09' if `h` is '09', '10' if `h` is '10', '11' if `h` is '11', '12' if `h` is '12' or '00', '01' if `h` is '13', '02' if `h` is '14', '03' if `h` is '15', '04' if `h` is '16', '05' if `h` is '17', '06' if `h` is '18', '07' if `h` is '19', '08' if `h` is '20', '09' if `h` is '21', '10' if `h` is '22', '11' if `h` is '23', and remains an empty string otherwise; `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', and 'PM' if `h` is '12' or '13'.**
