The code snippet assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is `'AM'`; `h1` is `'10'`.**
