Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time; `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; if `h` equals '00', then `h1` is '12', `m1` is the same as `m`, and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` and `time` remain unchanged, and `m1` is the same as `m`.**
