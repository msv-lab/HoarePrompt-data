The code snippet `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` will take a new input from the user, which consists of two integers separated by a space. These two integers will then be assigned to the variables `x` and `y`, respectively. The initial values of `x` and `y` are overwritten by the new input values. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is already defined as `i + 1` in the initial state, so it also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`.**
