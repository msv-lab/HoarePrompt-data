Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
2. `x` is the first integer from the new input.
3. `y` is the second integer from the new input.
4. `i` is `i + 1`, but this does not affect the `print` statement as `i` is not used in the `print` statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x, y)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output the values of `x` and `y`.
- `x` is the first integer from the new input.
- `y` is the second integer from the new input.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe them in terms of their roles (first and second integers from the new input).

### Output:
Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the new input and y is the second integer from the new input)**
