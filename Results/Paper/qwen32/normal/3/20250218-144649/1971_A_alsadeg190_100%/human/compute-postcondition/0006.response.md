Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant for this task.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input.
- `x` is not less than `y` (i.e., `x ≥ y`).

The print statement is:
```python
print(y, x)
```

This statement will print the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of their relationship and their roles in the input.

Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the input and x is the first integer from the input such that x is not less than y)**
