Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input (potentially updated in the else part); `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`. If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers updated according to the loop, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the cumulative differences up to `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, and `i` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`. If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, and `i` is set to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the new input split into two parts; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input. If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is adjusted such that each `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `m` is the minimum value in the adjusted list `a`, `ans` is the product of the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, and `i` is set to `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
