The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and then maps these parts to integers. These integers are stored in the list `a`. The variables `n` and `k` are not directly modified in the provided code snippet, so they retain their initial values. The variable `t` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
