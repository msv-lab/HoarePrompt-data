The variable `x` is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of the character '1' in the string `arr`. If '1' is not found in the string, `x` is assigned the value -1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.**
