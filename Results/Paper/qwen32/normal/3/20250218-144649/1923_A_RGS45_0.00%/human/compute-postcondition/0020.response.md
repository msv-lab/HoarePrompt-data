Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` is the new integer input provided by the user, `arr` is the new string input provided by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed new `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` from `x` to `n - y`.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to be the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to `n - y`. All other variables retain their previously described values and conditions.
