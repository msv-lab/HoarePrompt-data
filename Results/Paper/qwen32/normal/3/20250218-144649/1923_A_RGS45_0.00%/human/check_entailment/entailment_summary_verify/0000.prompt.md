You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a binary string of length `n` (containing only 0s and 1s with at least one 1). It then counts and prints the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of 1 in the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Issues in the Provided Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**:
   ```python
   y = arr[::-1].find('1')
   ```
   This line finds the position of the first '1' from the right side of the string but does not correctly translate this position to the original string. The value of `y` should be the position of the last '1' in the original string. Instead, it gives the distance from the end, which is not directly usable.

2. **Incorrect Slicing and Counting**:
   ```python
   z = arr[x:n - y]
   print(z.count('0'))
   ```
   The slicing `arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect. The `n - y` part does not correctly represent the end of the segment of interest. The correct range should be from the first '1' to the last '1', inclusive.

3. **Logic for Counting Moves**:
   The logic to count the minimum number of moves is incorrect. The code simply counts the number of '0's in a specific segment, but it does not account for the correct sequence of moves needed to bring all chips into a contiguous block.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the positions of all chips.
2. Calculate the total number of moves required to bring all chips into a contiguous block.

### Corrected Code Example:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = list(map(int, input('').split()))
        chip_positions = [i for i in range(n) if arr[i] == 1]
        median_position = chip_positions[len(chip_positions) // 2]
        moves = sum(abs(median_position - pos) for pos in chip_positions)
        print(moves)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of Corrected Code:

1. **Identify Chip Positions**:
   ```python
   chip_positions = [i for i in range(n) if arr[i] == 1]
   ```
   This line collects the indices of all cells that contain a chip.

2. **Determine Median Position**:
   ```python
   median_position = chip_positions[len(chip_positions) // 2]
   ```
   The median position minimizes the total number of moves required to bring all chips into a contiguous block.

3. **Calculate Total Moves**:
   ```python
   moves = sum(abs(median_position - pos) for pos in chip_positions)
   ```
   This line calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each chip's position and the median position, which gives the minimum number of moves.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect as it does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required. The corrected approach ensures that the logic aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
