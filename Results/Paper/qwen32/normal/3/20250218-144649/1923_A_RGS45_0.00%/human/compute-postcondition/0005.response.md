The code snippet reverses the string `arr` and then finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. This index is assigned to `y`. The value of `y` will be the position of the last occurrence of '1' in the original string `arr` because reversing the string and finding the first occurrence of '1' is equivalent to finding the last occurrence of '1' in the original string.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (This value is not affected by the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer (This value is not affected by the code snippet).
- `arr` is the string input provided by the user (This value is not affected by the code snippet).
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found (This value is not affected by the code snippet).

The new variable `y` will be the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.**
