The code snippet updates the value of `z` to be the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to `n - y`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999; `n` is the integer input provided by the user; `arr` is the new string input provided by the user; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found; `z` is the substring of `arr` from `x` to `n - y`.**
