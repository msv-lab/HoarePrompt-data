Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The main issue is in the `func_1` function, which is supposed to determine whether a given `k` results in a profit that is less than or equal to the maximum possible profit. However, this function is not correctly calculating the profit for a given `k`.

The `func_1` function incorrectly calculates the profit by adding `k * b` and `(n - k) * a`, which does not account for the decreasing price of the first `k` buns. The correct calculation should be the sum of the series for the first `k` buns, which is `b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1)`, and then adding `(n - k) * a` for the remaining buns.

Here is the corrected logic for calculating the profit for a given `k`:

```python
def calculate_profit(k, a, b, n):
    if k == 0:
        return n * a
    # Sum of the first k terms of the series b, b-1, ..., b-k+1
    profit_first_k = k * b - (k * (k - 1)) // 2
    # Profit from the remaining (n - k) buns
    profit_remaining = (n - k) * a
    return profit_first_k + profit_remaining

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = calculate_profit(k, a, b, n)
            if profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = profit
        print(max_profit)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In the original program, the binary search approach is also not correctly implemented to find the maximum profit. The binary search is being used to find the maximum `k` that satisfies a condition, but the condition is not correctly defined, and the profit calculation inside the binary search is incorrect.

Thus, the original program does not correctly compute the maximum profit for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
