Output State: **k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value 0. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
