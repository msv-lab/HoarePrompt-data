The code snippet `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the values of the last sublist in the list `S` to the variables `x` and `y`. Given that `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]`, the last sublist is `[x, y]`, so `x` and `y` will be assigned their own values from this sublist.

The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer provided by user input, `a` is a string provided by user input with at least two characters, and `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]` where `x` and `y` are determined by the first character `s` of string `a`. The variable `s` is the second character of the string `a`.

After executing the code, `x` and `y` retain their values as they were in the last sublist of `S`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer provided by the user input, `a` is a string provided by the user input that must have at least two characters, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]`, `s` is the second character of the string `a`, `x` and `y` are the values from the last sublist of `S`**.
