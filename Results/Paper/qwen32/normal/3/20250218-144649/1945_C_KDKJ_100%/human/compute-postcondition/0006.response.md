Output State: **The input to `int(input())` must be an integer greater than or equal to 0, and `func_1()` has been executed as many times as the value of that integer.**

In simpler terms, the loop will execute `func_1()` a number of times equal to the integer provided by the user input. After all iterations, `func_1()` will have been called that many times, and the loop will terminate.
