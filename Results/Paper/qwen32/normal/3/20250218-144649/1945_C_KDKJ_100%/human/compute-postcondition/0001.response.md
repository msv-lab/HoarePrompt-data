To solve this task, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. However, the code snippet provided does not include the definition of `func_1()`, so we cannot determine the exact impact of calling `func_1()` on the variables. 

Given the initial state and the lack of information about `func_1()`, we can only assume that `func_1()` does not modify any existing variables or introduce new ones unless explicitly defined. Since there is no information provided about the function's behavior, we can only state that it has been executed.

Output State: **The input to `int(input())` must be an integer greater than 0 and `func_1()` has been executed.**
