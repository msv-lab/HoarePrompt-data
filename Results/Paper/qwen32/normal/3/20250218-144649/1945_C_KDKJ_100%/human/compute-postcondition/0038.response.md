The code assigns the value of `S[i][0]` to the variable `left`. Since `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, `S[i][0]` refers to the first element of the list at index `i` in `S`. Therefore, `left` will take the value `S[i][0]`.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`.**
