The code assigns `right` the value of `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. This means `right` is now the difference between the second element of the last sublist in `S` and the second element of the `i`-th sublist in `S`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]; ans` is `-1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`.**
