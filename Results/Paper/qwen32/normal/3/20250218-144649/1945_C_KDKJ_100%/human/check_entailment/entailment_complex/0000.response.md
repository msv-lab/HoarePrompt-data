### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a sequence `a` of length `n` where each element is either `0` or `1`.
   - We need to place a road between two houses such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side.
   - Satisfaction means that in the left segment, the number of `0`s should be at least half the length of that segment, and in the right segment, the number of `1`s should be at least half the length of that segment.
   - We need to find the optimal position `i` for the road such that `|n/2 - i|` is minimized. If there are multiple such positions, we choose the smallest `i`.

2. **Approach**:
   - **Cumulative Count Calculation**:
     - We use a list `S` to keep track of cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s up to each index in the string `a`. For example, `S[i]` contains the cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s up to index `i-1` in `a`.
   - **Checking Conditions**:
     - For each possible position `i` (from `0` to `n`), we check if the conditions of satisfaction are met:
       - On the left side (up to `i`), the number of `0`s should be at least half the length of the left segment.
       - On the right side (from `i+1` to `n`), the number of `1`s should be at least half the length of the right segment.
   - **Minimizing Distance**:
     - We keep track of the position `i` that satisfies the conditions and minimizes `|n/2 - i|`. If there are multiple such positions, we select the smallest `i`.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - Reads the input values `n` and `a`.
     - Constructs the cumulative count list `S`.
     - Iterates over all possible positions `i` to find the optimal position that satisfies the conditions.
     - Prints the optimal position `i`.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - Reads the number of test cases.
     - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Verification:
- The provided code correctly constructs the cumulative count list `S` and checks the conditions for each possible position `i`.
- It correctly handles the minimization of `|n/2 - i|` and ensures that the smallest `i` is chosen in case of ties.
- The code is efficient and handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
