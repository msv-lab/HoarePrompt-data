Initial State: `n` is a positive integer provided by the user input, `a` is a string provided by the user input that must have at least one character, `S` is `[[0, 0]]`. If `a` is `'0'`, then `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`, and `a` is not equal to `'0'`.

The code snippet `S.append([x, y])` appends a new list `[x, y]` to the existing list `S`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer provided by the user input, `a` is a string provided by the user input that must have at least one character, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`. If `a` is `'0'`, then `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`, and `a` is not equal to `'0'`.**

Natural Language: The list `S` now contains two elements: the initial `[0, 0]` and the newly appended `[x, y]` where `x` is `1` and `y` is `0` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
