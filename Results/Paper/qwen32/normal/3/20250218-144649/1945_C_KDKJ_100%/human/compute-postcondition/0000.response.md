In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the input provided to the `int(input())` function. The loop will execute based on the integer value obtained from this input. The loop head only involves the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the integer value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than 0. The underscore `_` is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body, so we do not need to adjust its state.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the integer input is greater than 0.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be an integer greater than 0**
