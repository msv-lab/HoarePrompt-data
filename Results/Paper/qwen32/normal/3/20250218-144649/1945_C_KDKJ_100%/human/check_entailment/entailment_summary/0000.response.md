### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - An integer `n` (number of houses).
     - A string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, where '0' means the resident wants to live on the left side and '1' means the resident wants to live on the right side.
2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, determine the position `i` after which to build the road such that:
     - At least half of the residents on the left side want to live on the left side.
     - At least half of the residents on the right side want to live on the right side.
     - The road position `i` is as close to the middle of the village as possible.
     - If there are multiple such positions, choose the smallest `i`.

#### Solution Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads `n` and `a` from the input.
   - Creates a list `S` where `S[i]` is a pair `[x, y]` representing the number of '0's and '1's up to the `i-1`-th index in the string `a`.
   - Iterates over all possible positions `i` where the road could be built (from 0 to `n`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: Number of '0's on the left side (up to index `i-1`).
     - `lsum`: Total number of houses on the left side (up to index `i-1`).
     - `right`: Number of '1's on the right side (from index `i` to `n-1`).
     - `rsum`: Total number of houses on the right side (from index `i` to `n-1`).
   - Checks if the conditions are satisfied:
     - `left * 2 >= lsum`: At least half of the residents on the left side want to live on the left side.
     - `right * 2 >= rsum`: At least half of the residents on the right side want to live on the right side.
   - If the conditions are satisfied, it checks if this position `i` is closer to the middle (`n/2`) than the previously found position `ans`. If so, it updates `ans`.
   - After iterating over all possible positions, it prints the best position `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Verification:
- The solution correctly calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each index.
- It checks the conditions for each possible road position.
- It keeps track of the position that is closest to the middle while satisfying the conditions.
- It handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

The provided solution meets all the requirements of the problem description and correctly handles the given constraints. Thus, the solution is correct.
