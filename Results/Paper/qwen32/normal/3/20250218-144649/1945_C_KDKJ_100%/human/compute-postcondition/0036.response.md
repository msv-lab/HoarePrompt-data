Postcondition: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`. If `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, then `ans` remains `-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the previous value of `ans` (which was `-1`). If neither condition is met, `ans` remains `-1`.**
