Postcondition: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]; ans` is `-1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`. Additionally, `left * 2` is greater than or equal to `lsum` and `right * 2` is greater than or equal to `rsum`.**
