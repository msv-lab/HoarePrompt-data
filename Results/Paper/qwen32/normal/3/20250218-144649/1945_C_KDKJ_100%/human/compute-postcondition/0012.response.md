The code snippet `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the values of the last element in the list `S` to the variables `x` and `y`. Given the initial state, the last element of `S` is `[x, y]`. Therefore, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer provided by the user input, `a` is a string provided by the user input that must have at least one character, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`. If `a` is `'0'`, then `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`, and `a` is not equal to `'0'`. `s` is the next character in the string `a`.**
