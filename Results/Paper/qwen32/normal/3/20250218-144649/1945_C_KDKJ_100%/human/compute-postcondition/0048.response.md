Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 2`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i + 1][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (i + 1)`**

Natural Language: The value of `lsum` has been updated to the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
