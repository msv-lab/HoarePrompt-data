Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least two elements, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the next element in `F` (the second element if `f` was the first), `l` is the position where `left - f` is inserted in `D` to maintain sorted order, `mid` is the last calculated value such that `mid_sum - left` is not less than `right - mid_next_sum`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is not less than `right - f` minus 1.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least two elements, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the next element in `F` (the second element if `f` was the first), `D` must have at least two elements. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is not less than `right - f` minus 1, and `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`, and `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. In both cases, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least two elements, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the next element in `F` (the second element if `f` was the first), `D` must have at least two elements, `l` and `h` are adjusted based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`: if true, `l` is set to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`. `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least two elements, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the next element in `F` (the second element if `f` was the first), `D` must have at least two elements, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is now equal to `mid`. In both cases, `l` must be less than `h`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
