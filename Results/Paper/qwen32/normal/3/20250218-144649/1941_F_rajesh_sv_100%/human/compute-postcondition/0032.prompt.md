Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`. `A` is a list of integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems, sorted in ascending order, with length `n` and each element satisfying 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9. `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, with length `m` and each element satisfying 1 <= d_i <= 10^9. `F` is the list of values returned by `func_4()`. `max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is -inf, `index` is None.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        next_max_diff = max_diff
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined. If `diff` (which is `A[1] - A[0]`) is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, and `index` is set to 1. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` remains None, and `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`; otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains -inf.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]` and `index` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf and `index` remains None. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]` and `index` is set to 3, and `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` remains None, and `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`; otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
