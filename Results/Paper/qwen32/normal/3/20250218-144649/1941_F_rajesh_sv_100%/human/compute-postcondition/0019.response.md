Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `max_diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `index` remains None, `next_max_diff` is -inf.**

In this output state, the value of `max_diff` has been updated to be equal to `diff`, which is `A[2] - A[1]`. All other variables retain their initial values or states.
