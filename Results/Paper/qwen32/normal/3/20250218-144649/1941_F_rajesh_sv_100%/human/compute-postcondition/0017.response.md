The code snippet `diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]` calculates the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` of the list `A` and assigns it to the variable `diff`. Given that `i` is 2, `diff` will be `A[2] - A[1]`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`) are not affected by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` remains None, `next_max_diff` remains -inf.**
