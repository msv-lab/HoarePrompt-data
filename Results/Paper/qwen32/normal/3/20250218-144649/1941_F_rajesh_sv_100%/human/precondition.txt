x is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing the integers n, m, k, followed by three lists: a list of n integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), a list of m integers representing the complexities of the models (d_1, d_2, ..., d_m), and a list of k integers representing the complexities of the functions (f_1, f_2, ..., f_k). It is guaranteed that 1 <= t <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}, 1 <= d_i <= 10^9, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
