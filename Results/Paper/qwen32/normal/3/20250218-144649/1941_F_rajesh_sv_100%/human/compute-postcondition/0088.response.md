Postcondition: **`n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least two elements, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` equals `h`, `mid` is the last calculated value such that `mid_sum - left` is not less than `right - mid_next_sum`. If `l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.**
