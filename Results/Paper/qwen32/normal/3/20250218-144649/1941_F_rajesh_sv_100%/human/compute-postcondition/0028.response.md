The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `index`. Given that `i` is 3, `index` will now be 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `index` is 3, `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`**.
