The variable `h` is updated to the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least two elements, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the next element in `F` (the second element if `f` was the first), `D` must have at least two elements, `l` is the position where `left - f` is inserted in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is `mid`, and `l < h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `mid_sum - left` is not less than `right - mid_next_sum`.**
