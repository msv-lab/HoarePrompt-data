Postcondition: **`n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least two elements, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the next element in `F` (the second element if `f` was the first), `D` must have at least two elements, `l` and `h` are adjusted based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`: if true, `l` is set to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`. `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged.**
