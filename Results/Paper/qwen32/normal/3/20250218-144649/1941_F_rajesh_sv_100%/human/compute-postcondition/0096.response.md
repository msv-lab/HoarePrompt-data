Output State: **`n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least two elements, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the next element in `F` (the second element if `f` was the first), `D` must have at least two elements, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is not less than `right - f` minus 1, and `l < h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`.**

In natural language: The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged with their previously described properties and relationships.
