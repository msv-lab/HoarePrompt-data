### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants based on their preferences. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Introverts**: Each introvert must stay in a tent alone.
2. **Extroverts**: Each extrovert must stay in a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals**: Universals can stay in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

The solution needs to respect these preferences and calculate the minimum number of tents required. If it's not possible to satisfy all preferences, the solution should return `-1`.

Let's analyze the provided program:

- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
- **Condition Check**: The condition `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` checks two things:
  - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and there are less than 3 universals, and the total number of extroverts and universals is not a multiple of 3, then it prints `-1`. This is because it's impossible to form groups of three with the given extroverts and universals.
- **Tent Calculation**:
  - The program calculates the number of tents needed for introverts, which is simply `a`.
  - It then calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals by summing them and dividing by 3 (`(b + c) // 3`).
  - If there are any remaining people after forming groups of three (`(b + c) % 3 != 0`), it adds one more tent to accommodate them.

The logic seems correct based on the problem description. The program checks for impossible scenarios and calculates the minimum number of tents accurately.
