Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is 3; `n` is 5. If `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. Otherwise, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.**
