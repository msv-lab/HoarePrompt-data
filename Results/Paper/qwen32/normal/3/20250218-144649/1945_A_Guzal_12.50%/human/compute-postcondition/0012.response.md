Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the t test cases is described by three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. If the current test case satisfies the condition that `b % 3 != 0`, `c < 3`, and `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, or `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3` if `(b + c) % 3 == 0`.**
