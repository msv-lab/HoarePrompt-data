Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the t test cases is described by three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three non-negative integers read from the input.**

Natural Language: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are now assigned the values of three non-negative integers read from the input. The value of `t` and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged.
