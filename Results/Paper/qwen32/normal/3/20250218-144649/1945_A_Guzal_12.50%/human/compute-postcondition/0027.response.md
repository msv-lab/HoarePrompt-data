The code snippet `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `k` as `k + a + (b + c) // 3`, after the increment, `k` will be `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is 4; `n` is 5; `k` is `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.**
