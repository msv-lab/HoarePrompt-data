The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The values of `k` are determined by the conditions specified in the initial state, but since `a`, `b`, and `c` are reassigned, the value of `k` will be recalculated based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` in subsequent code (which is not provided here).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is 3; `n` is 5; `k` is to be recalculated based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` using the given conditions.**
