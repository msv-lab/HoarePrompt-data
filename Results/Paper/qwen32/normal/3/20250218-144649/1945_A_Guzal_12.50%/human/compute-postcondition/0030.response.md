Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is 4; `n` is 5; `k` is 0 if `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` is true. Otherwise, `k` is `k + a + (b + c) // 3`, and if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `k` is further incremented by 1.**
