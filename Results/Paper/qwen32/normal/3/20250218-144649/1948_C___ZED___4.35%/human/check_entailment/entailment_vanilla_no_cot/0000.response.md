Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) in all cases. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `n == 2` Case:**
   - The program incorrectly prints 'YES' for `n == 1`, which is not a valid case according to the problem constraints (`2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`). However, the main issue is that it does not correctly handle the case when `n == 2`.

2. **Logic Errors in Path Checking:**
   - The program uses a flag `no_path` to determine if a path exists. The logic for checking the path is flawed:
     - The first loop checks if all even-indexed cells in the second row (`b`) point to the right (`>`). If any of these cells do not point to the right, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
     - The second loop checks if all odd-indexed cells in the first row (`a`) point to the right (`>`). If any of these cells do not point to the right, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - However, these checks are not sufficient to determine if a path exists. The robot can move in any direction (left, right, up, down) before following the arrow, so the logic needs to consider all possible moves and transitions between rows.

3. **Incorrect Output for Some Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the robot can reach `(2, n)` by moving up or down at some point. For example, the program might incorrectly print 'NO' for cases where the robot can move up from the first row to the second row and then follow the arrows to reach `(2, n)`.

4. **Debugging Print Statements:**
   - The program includes `print(k)` statements, which are not needed and can interfere with the output.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the robot's movements and check if it can reach `(2, n)` by considering all possible moves and transitions between rows. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Start at (1, 1)
        x, y = 0, 0
        visited = set()
        
        while (x, y) not in visited:
            visited.add((x, y))
            
            if (x, y) == (1, n - 1):
                print('YES')
                break
            
            if x == 0:
                if y + 1 < n and a[y] == '>':
                    y += 1
                elif y - 1 >= 0 and a[y] == '<':
                    y -= 1
                elif x + 1 < 2:
                    x += 1
            else:
                if y + 1 < n and b[y] == '>':
                    y += 1
                elif y - 1 >= 0 and b[y] == '<':
                    y -= 1
                elif x - 1 >= 0:
                    x -= 1
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version simulates the robot's movements and checks if it can reach `(2, n)` by considering all possible moves and transitions between rows.
