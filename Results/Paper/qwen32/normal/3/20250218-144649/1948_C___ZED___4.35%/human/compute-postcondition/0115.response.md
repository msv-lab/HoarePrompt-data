The provided code snippet initializes a variable `no_path` to `False`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is the user's input; `b` is the user's input; `i` is `i + 2` (unchanged); `k` is `i + 4`; `no_path` is False**.
