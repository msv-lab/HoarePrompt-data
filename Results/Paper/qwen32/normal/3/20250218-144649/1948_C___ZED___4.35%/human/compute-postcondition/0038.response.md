Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string with the second-to-last character '>'. If `no_path` is `False`, then `k` is the largest odd number less than `n-1`, and `no_path` is `False` if any character at an odd index in `a` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` remains `True`. If `no_path` is `True`, then `k` is not defined in this context.**
