The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and the range `(1, n-1, 2)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` was set to `i + 4`. However, we need to consider the loop's range and the fact that `k` is incremented by 2 in each iteration.

Given the loop `for k in range(1, n - 1, 2)`, `k` starts at 1 and increments by 2 until it reaches `n-1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be the next value in this sequence.

If `k` was `i + 4` at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `k` should be `k + 2` (since the loop increments `k` by 2 each time).

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `k` was `i + 4`. For the next iteration, `k` should be `k + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is the user's input; `b` is the user's input; `i` is `i + 2` (unchanged); `k` is `k + 2`. If `a[k]` is not equal to '>', then `no_path` is set to False.**
