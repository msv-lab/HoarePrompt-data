Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`, and `no_path` is `False`. Additionally, the character at index `k` in string `b` is not `'>'`.**

Explanation: The value of `no_path` has been changed from `True` to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
