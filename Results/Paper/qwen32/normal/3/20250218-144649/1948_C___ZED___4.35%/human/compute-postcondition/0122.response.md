Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer; `a` is the user's input; `b` is the user's input; `i` is `i + 2` (unchanged); `no_path` is `False` if any `b[k]` for `k` in `[0, 2, 4, ..., n-2]` is not `'>'` or any `a[k]` for `k` in `[1, 3, 5, ..., n-2]` is not `'>'`, otherwise `no_path` is `True`.**
