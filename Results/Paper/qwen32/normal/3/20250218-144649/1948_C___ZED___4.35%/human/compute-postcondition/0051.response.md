The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `no_path`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string `'YES'` itself.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any variables.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `no_path`) are referenced in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
