The code snippet `b = input()` changes the value of `b` to whatever the user inputs. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user's input, `b` is the user's input, `i` is `i + 2`.**
