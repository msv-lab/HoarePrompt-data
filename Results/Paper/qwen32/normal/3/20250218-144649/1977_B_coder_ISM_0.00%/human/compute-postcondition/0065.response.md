Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with either 30 elements where no consecutive elements are `'1'` or 31 elements where the 31st element is `'1'` and no other consecutive elements are `'1'`, `length` is either 30 or 31, and `flag` is either 0 or not 0. If `flag` is not 0, `s` has 31 elements with the 31st element being `'1'` and `length` is 31. If `flag` is 0, `s` has 30 elements and `length` is 30.**
