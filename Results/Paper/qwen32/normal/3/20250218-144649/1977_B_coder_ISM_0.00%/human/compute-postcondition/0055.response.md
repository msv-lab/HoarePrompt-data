Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, `i` is 2. If `flag` is 1 and `s[2]` was originally `'0'`, then `s[2]` is set to `'1'` and `flag` remains 1. Otherwise, the state of `s` and `flag` remains unchanged as described in the precondition.**
