In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`. The loop variable is `nalla`. The state before the loop starts includes `t` being an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t` because it defines the range over which the loop will iterate. The variable `nalla` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Since `t` is already constrained to be between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, the loop will execute at least once as long as `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
