Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings, each either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit (from 0 to 29) of `x` is set or not, `length` is 30, `flag` is 0, and `nalla` is `nalla + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit (from 0 to 29) of `x` is set or not, with the exception that if `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and equal to `s[i + 1]`, then `s[i]` is changed to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. `length` remains 30, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, and `i` remains 0. If `flag` is 1, the first string in `s` is '0' and the remaining 29 strings are either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit (from 1 to 29) of `x` is set or not. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then the second string in `s` is '1' and the rest are either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` equals `s[i + 1]`, then `s[i]` is now '-1' and the rest of `s` remains either '1', '0', or '-1'. `length` remains 30. `nalla` is incremented by 1 if `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', otherwise `nalla` remains unchanged. `i` remains 1. `flag` is set to 0 if it was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', or if `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` equals `s[i + 1]`, otherwise `flag` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is either '1', '0', or '-1', `length` remains 30, `nalla` remains unchanged, `i` is 2. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[2]` was '0', then `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged. If `flag` was 0 and `s[2]` and `s[3]` were both '1', then `flag` remains 0; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
