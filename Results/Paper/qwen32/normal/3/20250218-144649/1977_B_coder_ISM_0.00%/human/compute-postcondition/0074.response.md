The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` modifies the list `s` by setting the element at index `i - 1` to `'-1'`. This change impacts the list `s` directly, while other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `s` is a list with either 30 elements where no consecutive elements are `'1'` or 31 elements where the 31st element is `'1'` and no other consecutive elements are `'1'`.
- If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i - 1]` is now `'-1'`.
- `length` is either 30 or 31.
- `flag` is either 0 or not 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- The element `s[i]` is now `'0'`.

After executing `s[i - 1] = '-1'`, the element at index `i - 1` in the list `s` is set to `'-1'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with either 30 elements where no consecutive elements are `'1'` or 31 elements where the 31st element is `'1'` and no other consecutive elements are `'1'`, except that `s[i - 1]` is now `'-1'`, `length` is either 30 or 31, `flag` is either 0 or not 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and the element `s[i]` is now `'0'`.**
