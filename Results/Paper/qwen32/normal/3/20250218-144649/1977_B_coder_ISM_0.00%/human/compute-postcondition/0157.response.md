Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of strings where each string is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then the element at index `i - 1` in `s` is now '-1'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. `flag` is either 0 or 1, `nalla` is unchanged, `length` is greater than 1, and `i` is 2.**
