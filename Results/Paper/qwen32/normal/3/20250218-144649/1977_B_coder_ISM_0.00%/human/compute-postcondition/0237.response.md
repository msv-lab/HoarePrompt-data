Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `flag` is 0 if `s[29]` is `'0'` or if the else part is taken, otherwise `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'1'`, `s` is a list of 30 strings where `s[i]` is `'0'`, `i` is `i + 1`, `length` is at least 2**

Explanation: The value of `s[i]` has been changed to `'0'`. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
