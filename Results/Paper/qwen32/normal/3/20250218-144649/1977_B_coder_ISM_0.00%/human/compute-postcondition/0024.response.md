Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each being either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not, except `s[0]` which is now `'1'`, and `length` is 30; `flag` is 1, `i` is 0.**

In natural language: The value of `s[0]` has been changed to `'1'`. All other variables retain their initial values.
