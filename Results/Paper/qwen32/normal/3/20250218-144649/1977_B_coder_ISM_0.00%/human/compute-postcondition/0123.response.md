Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where `s[i]` is now '-1' and the rest are either '1', '0', or '-1', `length` remains 30, `nalla` remains the same, `i` is 1, and `flag` remains the same.**

In simpler terms, the value at index `i` of the list `s` is now '-1'. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `length`, `nalla`, `i`, and `flag`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
