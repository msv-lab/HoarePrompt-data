Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each being either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is 0. If `flag` is 1, then the first element of `s` is `'0'`. If `flag` is 0, then either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or `s[i]` is not `'1'`.**
