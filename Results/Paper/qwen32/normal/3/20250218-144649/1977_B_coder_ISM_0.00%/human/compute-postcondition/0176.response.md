Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or `'0'`. Specifically, `s` contains `'1'` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, otherwise `s` contains `'0'`. `i` is 29; `s` now has an additional element `'1'` appended to it.**

In simple terms: The list `s` now has one more element `'1'` added to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
