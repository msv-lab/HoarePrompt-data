You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 30
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')
        print(*s)
        flag = 0
        for i in range(0, 29):
            if flag and s[i] == '0':
                s[i] = '1'
                flag = 0
            if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):
                s[i] = '-1'
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        print(length)
        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `x`. For each `x`, it generates a binary representation of length 30, modifies it to ensure no consecutive '1's and '-1's, and then outputs the modified length and the modified binary representation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate a valid array according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that there are no consecutive non-zero elements in the array. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Binary Representation Construction**:
   The program first constructs a binary representation of the number `x` and stores it in the list `s`. However, it does not handle the requirement that no two consecutive elements in the array should be non-zero.

2. **Modification to Ensure No Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**:
   The program then attempts to modify the binary representation to ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero. However, the logic for this modification is flawed and does not always produce a valid array.

3. **Example of Failure**:
   Consider the input `x = 3`. The binary representation of `3` is `11`. According to the problem, a valid array could be `[-1, 1]` (since \(-1 \cdot 2^0 + 1 \cdot 2^1 = -1 + 2 = 1\)). However, the program will initially construct the binary representation as `[1, 1]` and then try to modify it. The modification logic might not correctly handle this case, leading to an invalid array.

Let's test this specific case:

Input:
```
1
3
```

Expected Output:
```
2
-1 1
```

Actual Output (based on the provided program):
```
2
1 1
```

This output is incorrect because it contains consecutive non-zero elements.

Therefore, the program is not always correct and does not handle all edge cases as required by the problem description.
