Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where `s[1]` is now `'-1'`, and the conditions for other elements of `s` remain as per the initial state, `flag` is 1, `i` is 1.**

Natural language explanation: The value at index `1` of the list `s` is now `'-1'`. The `flag` is set to `1`. All other elements of `s` and the other variables (`t`, `x`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
