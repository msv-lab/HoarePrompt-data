### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, code, and function summary to ensure correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Beautiful Pair Criteria**:
   - \( a_i + a_j \) is divisible by \( x \).
   - \( a_i - a_j \) is divisible by \( y \).

2. **Residue Conditions**:
   - For \( a_i + a_j \) to be divisible by \( x \), we need \( a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x} \) or equivalently, \( a_i \equiv r_x \pmod{x} \) where \( r_x = -a_j \% x \).
   - For \( a_i - a_j \) to be divisible by \( y \), we need \( a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y} \).

3. **Approach**:
   - Use a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the count of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` encountered so far.
   - For each element `num` in the array, compute \( r_x = -num \% x \) and \( r_y = num \% y \).
   - Check if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map` and add its count to the total count.
   - Update the `residue_map` with the current number's residues `(num \% x, num \% y)`.

#### Code Review:
- **Reading Input**:
  - The input is read and split into a list of strings.
  - The number of test cases `t` is extracted.
  - For each test case, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` are extracted.

- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - A `residue_map` is initialized to keep track of the count of residues.
  - For each number `num` in the array:
    - Compute \( r_x = -num \% x \) and \( r_y = num \% y \).
    - Check if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map` and add its count to the total count.
    - Update the `residue_map` with the current number's residues `(num \% x, num \% y)`.

- **Output**:
  - The count of beautiful pairs for each test case is appended to the results list.
  - The results are printed, one per line.

#### Verification:
- **Residue Calculation**:
  - The calculation of \( r_x = -num \% x \) is correct. It ensures that we are checking for the condition \( a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x} \).
  - The calculation of \( r_y = num \% y \) is correct. It ensures that we are checking for the condition \( a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y} \).

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of a dictionary to keep track of residues allows the program to count beautiful pairs in linear time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles arrays of different sizes and values of `x` and `y` correctly.
  - It also handles the case where `x` and `y` are equal or different.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the given array for each test case. The residue calculations and the use of a dictionary to keep track of residues are correct and efficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
