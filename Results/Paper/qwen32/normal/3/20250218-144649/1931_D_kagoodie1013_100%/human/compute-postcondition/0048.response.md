Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` from the current test case; `count` is 0 (reset for the new test case); `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` not yet processed; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary (reset for the new test case).**

Explanation: The variable `count` has been reset to 0 for the new test case. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
