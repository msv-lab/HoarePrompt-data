Functionality: **The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of integers \( n \), \( x \), \( y \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates a count based on specific residue conditions related to \( x \) and \( y \) and the elements in \( a \). The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case.**
