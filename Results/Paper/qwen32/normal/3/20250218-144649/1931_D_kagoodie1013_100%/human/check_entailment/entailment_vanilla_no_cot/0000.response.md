To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to verify if the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the solution.

### Problem Breakdown
A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Solution Approach
The provided solution uses a hash map (`residue_map`) to keep track of the remainders of the elements in the array when divided by \(x\) and \(y\). The key idea is to use the properties of modular arithmetic to count the number of beautiful pairs efficiently.

For each element `num` in the array, the solution calculates:
- `r_x = -num % x`: This is the remainder when `-num` is divided by \(x\).
- `r_y = num % y`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by \(y\).

The pair \((r_x, r_y)\) is used to look up the number of previous elements that, when paired with the current element, form a beautiful pair. The count of such pairs is incremented accordingly.

The current element's remainder pair `(num % x, num % y)` is then added to the hash map, incrementing its count.

### Verification
Let's verify if the solution correctly implements the logic:
- The calculation of `r_x` and `r_y` correctly represents the conditions for a beautiful pair.
- The use of the hash map allows for efficient counting of pairs without needing to check every possible pair, which would be computationally expensive for large arrays.
- The solution correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the logic and implementation, the provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
