Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case; `results` is an empty list; `count` is the total number of pairs (r_x, r_y) that have been seen before for each element in `arr`; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases`; `residue_map` is a dictionary that maps each unique (num % x, num % y) pair to the number of times it has been encountered; `num` is the last element in `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed for all elements in `arr`:
- `test_cases` remains unchanged as it was initially.
- `results` remains an empty list as it is not modified within the loop.
- `count` holds the total number of times a pair of residues (r_x, r_y) has been encountered before for each element in `arr`.
- `arr` remains the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases`.
- `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple representing the residues `(num % x, num % y)` and the value is the count of how many times that tuple has been seen.
- `num` is the last element processed in `arr`.
