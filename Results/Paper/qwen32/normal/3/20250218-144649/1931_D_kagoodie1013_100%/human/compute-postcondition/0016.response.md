The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has more than two integers, the loop will execute again for the next integer in `arr`.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least two integers, `num` is `arr[1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next integer in `arr`, which would be `arr[2]`.

Here is the adjusted state:
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least three integers; `r_x` is `-arr[2] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[2] % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[2] % x, arr[2] % y)`; `residue_map` is `{(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y): 1, (arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y): 1}`; `num` is `arr[2]`**
