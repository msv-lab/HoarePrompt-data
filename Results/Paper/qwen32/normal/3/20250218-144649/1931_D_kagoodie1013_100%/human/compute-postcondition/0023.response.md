The code snippet appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. The other variables (`test_cases`, `arr`, `residue_map`, and `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is the total number of pairs (r_x, r_y) that have been seen before for each element in `arr`; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases`; `residue_map` is a dictionary that maps each unique (num % x, num % y) pair to the number of times it has been encountered; `num` is the last element in `arr`.**
