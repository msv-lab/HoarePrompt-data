The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in non-decreasing order. However, the problem statement already specifies that `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. Therefore, sorting `a` again does not change its order. The values of `t`, `n`, and the sorted nature of `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
