The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list of integers to the variable `a`. 

The initial state specifies that `a` is already a list of `n` integers. However, the code snippet overwrites the existing `a` with a new list of integers provided by the user input. Therefore, the value of `a` changes to reflect the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
