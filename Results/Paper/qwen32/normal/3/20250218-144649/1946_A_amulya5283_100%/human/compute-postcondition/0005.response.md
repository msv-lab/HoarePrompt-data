Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**

In natural language: The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still the integer input by the user, between 1 and 10^5 inclusive. The list `a` has been sorted in non-decreasing order, meaning the integers in the list are now arranged from the smallest to the largest, while each integer `a_i` still satisfies the condition 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
