The code snippet calculates the value of `mdx` based on the length of the list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged. The value of `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `res` is 0; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.**
