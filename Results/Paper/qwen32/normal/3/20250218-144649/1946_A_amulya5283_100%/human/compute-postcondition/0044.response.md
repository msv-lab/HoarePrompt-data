Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. If `n` is 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is the count of elements from `a[mdx]` to `a[n-1]` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
