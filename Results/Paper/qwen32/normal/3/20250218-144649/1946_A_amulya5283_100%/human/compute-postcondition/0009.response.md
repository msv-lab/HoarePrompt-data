Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `res` is 0.**

In this state, the variable `res` has been initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) retain their initial values and conditions.
