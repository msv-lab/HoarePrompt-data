Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the length of the list `a` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `i + 2`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, `res` is 2, otherwise `res` is 1.**
