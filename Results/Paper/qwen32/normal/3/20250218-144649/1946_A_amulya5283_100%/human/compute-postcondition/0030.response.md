Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `res` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from the initial state.
