Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is incremented by 1.**
