Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it outputs the count of elements in the sorted list `a` that are equal to the median element (or the middle element if `n` is odd, or the larger of the two middle elements if `n` is even). If `n` is 1, it simply outputs 1.**
