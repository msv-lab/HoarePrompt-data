Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 updated to `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`, `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and `nums[1]` set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is 1

```
k -= nums[i]
```

The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `nums[i]` from it. Given that `i` is 1, `nums[1]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 updated to `k - 2 * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`, `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and `nums[1]` set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is 1**.
