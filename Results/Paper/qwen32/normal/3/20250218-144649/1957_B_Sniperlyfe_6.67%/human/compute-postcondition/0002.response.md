The code snippet `nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` modifies the list `nums` at the index `i`. Here's the breakdown of the impact:

- `nums[i]` is assigned a value based on the bit length of `k`.
- `k.bit_length()` computes the number of bits necessary to represent `k` in binary.
- `1 << k.bit_length() - 1` shifts the number `1` to the left by `k.bit_length() - 1` positions, effectively creating a binary number with a `1` followed by `k.bit_length() - 1` zeros.
- Subtracting `1` from this result flips all the bits to the right of the leading `1`, creating a binary number with `k.bit_length() - 1` ones.

Thus, `nums[i]` is set to a value that is a sequence of `k.bit_length() - 1` ones in binary.

The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and `k` have specific ranges, and `nums` is a list of length `n` initialized to `0`. The variable `i` is not initialized in the initial state, but it is used in the code snippet. Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we will denote the updated state of `nums` at index `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[i]` set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is not yet initialized**.
