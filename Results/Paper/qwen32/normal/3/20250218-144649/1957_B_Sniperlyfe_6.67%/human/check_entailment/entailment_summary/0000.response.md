### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it meets the problem requirements.

The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`, and the bitwise OR of these integers should have the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not ensure that the sum of the sequence equals `k` or that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. **Sum of the Sequence**:
   - The first `n-1` elements of `nums` are set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
   - The last element of `nums` is supposed to be adjusted by adding `k` to it, but this is incorrect because the first `n-1` elements already exceed `k` in most cases, making the sum of the sequence much larger than `k`.

2. **Bitwise OR**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. The current implementation does not achieve this because it does not consider how to distribute the values of `k` across the sequence to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to distribute the value of `k` across the sequence in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. One effective way is to use the smallest possible numbers that contribute to setting as many bits as possible in the bitwise OR.

For example, if `k` is 5 and `n` is 2, we can use the numbers 1 and 4 (binary 001 and 100), which gives us a bitwise OR of 5 (binary 101) with 2 ones. This is better than using 3 and 2 (binary 011 and 010), which gives us a bitwise OR of 3 (binary 011) with only 2 ones, but in this case, both solutions are valid since they have the same number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it does not meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
