In the given for loop, the loop head contains the variable `j` and the range function parameters `n - 1`, `-1`, and `-1`. The loop iterates from `j = n - 1` down to `j = 0`. 

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n` is at least 1, as this will make the range non-empty. The initial value of `j` should be `n - 1`, and the loop will decrement `j` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1` (but does not include `-1`).

Given the state before the loop starts, `i` is `n - 4`, but `i` is not part of the loop head, so we do not need to adjust it for the loop to execute. The state of `dp[0][j]` does not affect whether the loop executes, but it is part of the context in which the loop operates.

Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is to ensure that `n` is at least 1 so that the loop can execute.

State: **`dp[0][j]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from position `j` in the `cards` list, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`**
