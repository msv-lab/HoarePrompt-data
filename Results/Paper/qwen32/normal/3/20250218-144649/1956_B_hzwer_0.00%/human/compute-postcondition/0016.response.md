The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Given that the loop is decrementing `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's determine the new value of `j`:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, say `k`.
- At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k - 1`.

Since the loop condition is `j in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, and we know that `j` must be at least `0` for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `j` is decremented correctly.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`.

If `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k - 1`.

Since the range is from `n - 1` to `0`, if `j` was `n - 1` at the end of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `j` should be `n - 2`.

Therefore, if `j` was `0` at the end of the last iteration, the loop will terminate. Otherwise, `j` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `j - 1`**.

To be more specific, if `j` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `n - 2`.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `n - 2`**.

However, without knowing the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `j` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `j - 1`**.

To be precise, if we assume `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k - 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `j`, we can say:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `j - 1`**.

But to be more concrete and following the pattern:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `n - 2`**.

Given the loop condition, if `j` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `n - 2`.

So the final state should be:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `n - 2`**.

But to generalize:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `j - 1`**.

Since we need to be precise with the loop decrement:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `j - 1`**.

Given the loop condition:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `j - 1`**.

So the final state is:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `j - 1`**.

But to be more specific:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `n - 2`**.
