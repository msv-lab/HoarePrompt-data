The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, but since `j` is already at `0`, the loop will terminate after this iteration.

However, for the sake of understanding the state just before the loop would terminate, we can consider the state when `j` is `1` (right before it becomes `0`).

State: **`dp[0][j]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from position `j` in the `cards` list. If the `cards` list does not contain `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the `cards` list contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`. If the `cards` list contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `n` is at least 1, and `j` is `1`.**
