Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0.**

This means that the value of `dp[n - 2][0]` has been explicitly set to 0. All other elements in the `dp` list remain unchanged from their initial state. The values of `n` and `cards` are still as they were provided in the initial state.
