The code snippet `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. This means that the value at position `[i][j]` in the `dp` 2D list is updated to the value at position `[i + 1][j]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `cards` is a list of integers read from input and does not contain the integer `j + 1`.
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is 0.

After executing the code snippet, the only change is that `dp[i][j]` now holds the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`. The values of `n`, `cards`, and all other elements in `dp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input and does not contain the integer `j + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`, and all other elements of `dp` are as initially defined.**
