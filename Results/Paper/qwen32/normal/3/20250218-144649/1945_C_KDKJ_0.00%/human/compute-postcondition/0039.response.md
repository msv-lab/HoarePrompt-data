Output State: **`[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` is the input list; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`.**

In this output state, the input list remains unchanged. The value of `n` is still greater than 0. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The variable `left` is assigned the value of the first element of the `i`-th sublist in the input list `S`.
