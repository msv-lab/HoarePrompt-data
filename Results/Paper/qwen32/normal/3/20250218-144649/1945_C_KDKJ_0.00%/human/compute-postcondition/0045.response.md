Postcondition: **The input list `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `left + S[i][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - lsum`. If the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is updated to `i`.**
