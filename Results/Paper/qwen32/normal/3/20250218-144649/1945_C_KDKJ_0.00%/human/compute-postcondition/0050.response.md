The code snippet assigns the value of `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]` to the variable `right`. This means `right` will now hold the difference between the second element of the last sublist in `S` and the second element of the `i`-th sublist in `S`.

Given the initial state, the list `S` remains unchanged, `n` is still greater than 0, `i` retains its value, `left` is still `S[i][0]`, and `lsum` is still `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `right` with its calculated value.

Output State: **The input list `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`.**
