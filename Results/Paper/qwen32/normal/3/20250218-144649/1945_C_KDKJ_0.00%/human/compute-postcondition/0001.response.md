To provide the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine how the initial state will be affected. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact output state. However, if we assume that `func_1()` does not modify any variables or the input, the output state would be the same as the initial state.

Given the lack of information about `func_1()`, the most we can say is that the input remains a positive integer and no other changes occur.

Output State: **Input must be a positive integer**.
