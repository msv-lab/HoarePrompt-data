Postcondition: **`[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` is the input list; `ans` is 0; `satisfy` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `left + count_1`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + count_1)`. Additionally, `left * 2` is not less than `lsum` and `right * 2` is not less than `rsum`. The condition `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)` is true.**

This postcondition retains all the initial conditions stated in the precondition and includes the additional condition specified in the if statement.
