To determine the output state, it is essential to understand the function `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided information, we cannot determine its impact on the variables directly. However, we can assume that `func_1()` might modify the state of `n` or introduce new variables.

Given the initial state is that `n` is a positive integer that has been decremented by 1, we can denote the value of `n` as `n-1`. Since `func_1()` is called, it could potentially change `n` or introduce other variables. However, without the definition of `func_1()`, we can only assume that `n` remains `n-1` unless `func_1()` explicitly modifies it.

If `func_1()` does not modify `n`, the output state will be the same as the initial state with respect to `n`. If `func_1()` modifies `n` or introduces new variables, we would need that information to provide an accurate output state.

Assuming `func_1()` does not modify `n`, the output state remains:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is decremented by 1**.

If `func_1()` modifies `n` or introduces new variables, please provide the definition of `func_1()` for an accurate output state.
