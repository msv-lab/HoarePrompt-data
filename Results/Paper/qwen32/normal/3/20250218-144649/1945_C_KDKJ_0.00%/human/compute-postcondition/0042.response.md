The code snippet calculates `rsum` by subtracting `lsum` from `n`. The values of `n`, `lsum`, and the list `S` are given, and `i` is incremented from its previous value. The values of `left` and `right` are also calculated based on the list `S` and the index `i`.

Output State: **`[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` is the input list; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `left + S[i][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - lsum`.**

In simpler terms, the output state includes the input list `S`, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `left` is updated to the first element of the `i`-th sublist of `S`, `lsum` is the sum of `left` and the second element of the `i`-th sublist of `S`, `right` is recalculated as the difference between the second element of the last sublist of `S` and the second element of the `i`-th sublist of `S`, and `rsum` is the result of subtracting `lsum` from `n`.
