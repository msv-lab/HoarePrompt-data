Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `i` is 2 if `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, and `j` is 2**

In simple terms, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial conditions still valid.
