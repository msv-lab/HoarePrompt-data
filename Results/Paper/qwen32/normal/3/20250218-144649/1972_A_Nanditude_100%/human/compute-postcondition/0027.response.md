The code snippet provided sets `cnt` to 0. This means that any previous value of `cnt` is discarded and replaced with 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 0, `i` is the final index in `a` that has been considered.**
