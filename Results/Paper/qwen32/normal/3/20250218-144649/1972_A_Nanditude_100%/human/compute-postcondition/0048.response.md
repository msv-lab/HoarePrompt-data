The code snippet `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. This means the previous value of `b` is overwritten by the new list of integers.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet and retain their previous values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is the specific input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is the total number of times `b[j] < a[i]` was true during the loop, and `i` is the total number of times `b[j] >= a[i]` was true during the loop.**
