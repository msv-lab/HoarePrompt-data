The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, and `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, and `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.**
