The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is either 0 or 2. Therefore, after the increment, `i` will be either 1 or 3.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `cnt`, `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is either 1 or 3, and `j` is 2.**
