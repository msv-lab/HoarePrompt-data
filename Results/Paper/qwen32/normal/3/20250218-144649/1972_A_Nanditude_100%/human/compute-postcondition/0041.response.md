The code snippet provided increments the value of `i` by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `j` is `j + 1`, `i` is increased by 1.**
