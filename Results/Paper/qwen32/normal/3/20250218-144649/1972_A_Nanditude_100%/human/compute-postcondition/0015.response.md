The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `j` is 1; `i` is increased by 1.**
