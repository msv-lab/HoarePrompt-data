The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged by the code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes `t` still being an input integer greater than 0 and `n` being the integer value obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**
