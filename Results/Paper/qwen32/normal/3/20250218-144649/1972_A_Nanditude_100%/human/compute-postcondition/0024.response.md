Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `cnt` is the total number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` as the loop progresses, `i` is the final index in `a` that has been considered.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the input integer, which is greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
