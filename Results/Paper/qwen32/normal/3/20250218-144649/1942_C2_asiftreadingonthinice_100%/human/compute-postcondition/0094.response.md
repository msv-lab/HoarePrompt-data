The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements of the list `tmp`. At the end of the last iteration, `tmp` is a non-empty list, and `i` has taken the value of the last element processed in the loop.

To execute one more time, `tmp` must still have elements left to process, and `i` should be updated to the next element in the list.

Let's assume the last value of `i` was `tmp[k]` for some index `k`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `tmp[k+1]` if `k+1` is within the bounds of the list `tmp`.

State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`, `i` is the next element in `tmp`**
