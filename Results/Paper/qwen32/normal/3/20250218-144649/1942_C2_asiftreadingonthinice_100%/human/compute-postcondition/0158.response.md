The code snippet `ans += y` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer minus the sum of `i - 1` for each `i` in `tmp` that it could accommodate, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + number of iterations`, `tt` remains unchanged, `ans` is calculated based on the initial conditions plus the sum of `i` for each `i` in `tmp` that it could accommodate, and `tmp` is a sorted list of integers; `ans` is increased by `y`.**
