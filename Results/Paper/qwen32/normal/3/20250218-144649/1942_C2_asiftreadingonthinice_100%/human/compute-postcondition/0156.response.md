Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer minus (`i - 1`) if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`. If `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `i` and `y` is further decreased by `i - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
