Postcondition: **`ans` is updated based on the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`: if `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is incremented by 1; if `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `ans` is set to `x + y - 2 + 1` and `tmp` is updated to include `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; otherwise, `ans` is set to `x + y - 2` and `tmp` remains unchanged. `y`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, and `a` remain the same. `i` is incremented by 1.**
