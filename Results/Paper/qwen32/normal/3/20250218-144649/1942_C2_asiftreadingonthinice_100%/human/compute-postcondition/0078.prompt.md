Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `ii` is 1; `a` is the newly provided sorted list of integers; `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed or the first element that caused the loop to break; `ans` is `x + y - 2`; `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `ii` is 1; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed or the first element that caused the loop to break; `ans` is `x + y - 1` if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` is a list containing `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `ii` is 1; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is `x + y`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 1`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, `tmp` is a list containing `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is 2; `ans` is the result from the previous iteration incremented by 1 if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ans` remains the result from the previous iteration. If `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0` and `a[i] - a[i - 1] != 2`, `tmp` is the list from the previous iteration with an additional element `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` appended; otherwise, `tmp` remains the list from the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
