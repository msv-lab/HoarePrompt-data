The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `tt` and `t` remain unchanged, and `ii` remains 0 as it is not affected by the code. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated with the values read from the input.

Output State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`; `ii` is 0**.
