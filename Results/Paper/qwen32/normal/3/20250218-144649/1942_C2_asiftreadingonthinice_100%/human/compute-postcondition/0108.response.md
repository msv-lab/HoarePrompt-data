The code snippet `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The variables `ans`, `ii`, and `tt` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is `Initial ans + sum(tmp) + Initial y - sum(i - 1 for i in tmp)`
- `y` is `Initial y - sum(i - 1 for i in tmp)`
- `ii` is `ii + 1`
- `tt` remains unchanged

After the code execution, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be set to the integers read from the input, and the other variables will retain their initial values.

Output State: **`ans` is `Initial ans + sum(tmp) + Initial y - sum(i - 1 for i in tmp)`, `y` is `Initial y - sum(i - 1 for i in tmp)`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**
