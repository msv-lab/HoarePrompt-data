The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially `x + y - 2`. After the increment, `ans` becomes `x + y - 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `x + y - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`; `ii` is 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 elements; `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`; `ans` is `x + y - 1`; `tmp` is an empty list; `i` is 1**.
