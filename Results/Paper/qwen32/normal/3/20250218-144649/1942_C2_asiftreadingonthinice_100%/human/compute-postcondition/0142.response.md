The code snippet `ans += i` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Given the initial conditions, the other variables remain unchanged except for `ans`.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `ans` is calculated based on the initial conditions plus `i`, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**
