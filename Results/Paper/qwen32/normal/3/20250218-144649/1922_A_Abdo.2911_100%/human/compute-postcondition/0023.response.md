The values of the variables do not change due to the `break` statement, which only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `possible` is `True`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
