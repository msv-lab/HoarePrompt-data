The code snippet assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged according to the provided initial state. Since `i` is described as `i + 1`, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the initial state description. However, based on the given information, we will consider `i` as it is, without altering its value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `possible` is `True`**.
