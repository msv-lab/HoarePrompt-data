The code snippet sets the variable `possible` to `True`. This change overrides the initial condition that determined the value of `possible` based on the values of `a[0]`, `b[0]`, and `c[0]`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, and `i` is 1.**
