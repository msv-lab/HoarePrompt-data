Postcondition: **`possible` is `True` if `c[0]` is not equal to `a[0]` and `a[0]` equals `b[0]`. If `a[0]` does not equal `b[0]`, `possible` is `False` if `c[0]` is equal to either `a[0]` or `b[0]`. Otherwise, `possible` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. In all cases, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, and `i` is 0.**
