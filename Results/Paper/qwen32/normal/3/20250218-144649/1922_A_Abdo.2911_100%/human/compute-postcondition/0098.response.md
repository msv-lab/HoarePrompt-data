The code snippet provided only assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `possible`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, or `c[i]`. Therefore, the conditions that `n` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, and the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`; `possible` is `True`.**
