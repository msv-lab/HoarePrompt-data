The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. However, the value of `n` in the initial state is not explicitly given, only its constraints.

After executing the code, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
