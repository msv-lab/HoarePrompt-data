The code snippet sets the variable `possible` to `True`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `possible` is `True`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
