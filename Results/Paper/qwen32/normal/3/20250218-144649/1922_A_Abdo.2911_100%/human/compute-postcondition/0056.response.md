Postcondition: **`possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, otherwise `possible` remains `False`. `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, `i` is 0, and `a[0]` equals `b[0]`.**
