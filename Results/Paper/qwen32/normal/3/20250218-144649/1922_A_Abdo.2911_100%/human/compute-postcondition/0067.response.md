Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, and `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the variable `_` has been incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
