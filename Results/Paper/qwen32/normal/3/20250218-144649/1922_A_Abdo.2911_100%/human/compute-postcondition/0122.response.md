The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables directly but influences the flow of the loop. In this case, since `i` is already defined as `i + 1`, this value remains unchanged, and `n` continues to be greater than 0. The `continue` statement does not alter the values of `n` or `i`; it simply tells the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
