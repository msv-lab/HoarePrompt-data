The `break` statement will exit the current loop or control structure, but it does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `possible`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `possible` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `possible` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
