You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. It calculates and prints the maximum number of groups of three that can be formed from these counts, applying a special rule for unpaired elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The sequence initially consists of p1 ones, p2 twos, p3 threes, and p4 fours.

### Key Observations

1. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of two identical numbers is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR of 1 and 3 is 2, and XOR of 2 and 3 is 1.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - Alice wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero.

3. **Eve's Strategy**:
   - Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, so she should aim to leave sequences where the XOR is zero after her removals.

### Calculation Strategy

To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to leave sequences with an even number of each number (except possibly one number, if the total count of numbers is odd). This ensures that the XOR of the sequence is zero.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Counting Pairs**:
   - For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), count the number of pairs. Each pair contributes to Bob's win because the XOR of a pair of the same number is zero.
   - For numbers 1 and 3, each pair contributes to Bob's win directly.
   - For numbers 2 and 4, each pair also contributes to Bob's win because they are already zero in XOR terms with themselves.

2. **Handling Odd Counts**:
   - If the count of a number is odd, one number will be left unpaired. This unpaired number can be strategically left to ensure the XOR is non-zero, but it doesn't directly contribute to Bob's win.

3. **Formulating the Solution**:
   - For each type of number, calculate the number of pairs: `x // 2`.
   - If the number is 1 or 3, an additional number can contribute to Bob's win if it is the last number: `x % 2 * (i < 3)`.
   - Sum these values for all types of numbers and divide by 3 to get the maximum number of turns Bob can win.

### Program Analysis

The provided program implements the above logic. Let's break it down:

- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
- It calculates the number of pairs for each type of number and the additional contribution for numbers 1 and 3.
- It sums these values and divides by 3 to determine the maximum number of turns Bob can win.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.
