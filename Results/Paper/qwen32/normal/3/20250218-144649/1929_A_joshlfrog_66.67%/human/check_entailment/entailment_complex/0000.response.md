### Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The provided code, however, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array for each test case, which does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty as defined by the problem.

The beauty of the array is maximized when the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in either ascending or descending order. For example, if the array is sorted in ascending order, the beauty is the sum of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements, which is equivalent to the difference between the maximum and minimum values multiplied by the number of gaps (which is `n-1`), but due to the nature of the problem, simply the difference between the max and min values is the correct approach for maximizing the beauty when considering the absolute differences.

However, the provided code does not sort the array; it merely finds the maximum and minimum values and prints their difference. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the order of elements, which is crucial for maximizing the beauty as defined by the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as per the problem's requirements. It should sort the array and then compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements to get the correct result.
