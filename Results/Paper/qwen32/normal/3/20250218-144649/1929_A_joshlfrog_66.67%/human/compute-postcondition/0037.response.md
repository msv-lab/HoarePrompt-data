The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` should be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. `l` remains the same as it is the length of the list `nums` and does not change during the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than 0; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces; `e` is `e + 1`. If `nums[i]` is greater than 0, then `x` is set to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. `i` is incremented by 1**
