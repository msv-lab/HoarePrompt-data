The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. The values of `t`, `l`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `nums[i]` was greater than `x`, `x` would have been updated to `nums[i]`, but since the code only assigns `nums[i]` to `y`, `x` remains as it was. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `nums[i]` to `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces, `i` is `i + 1`. If `nums[i] > x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged. `y` is `nums[i]`.**
