The code snippet `l = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `l`. This means the value of `l` changes, but the values of `t`, `nums`, `x`, `y`, and `e` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces; `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`; `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`; `e` is `e + 1`.**
