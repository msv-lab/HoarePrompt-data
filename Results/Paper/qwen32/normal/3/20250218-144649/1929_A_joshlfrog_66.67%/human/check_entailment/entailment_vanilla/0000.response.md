Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is rearranged. The beauty of an array \(a\) is calculated as:

\[
\text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})
\]

To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. The optimal strategy is to arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. One such arrangement is to sort the array in ascending order and then rearrange it in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest elements.

However, the problem can be simplified. The maximum beauty can be achieved by simply taking the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. This is because the maximum difference between any two elements in the array will contribute to the maximum beauty when the array is optimally rearranged.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is initialized to 0, which is incorrect because the minimum possible value of `x` should be the smallest element in the array.
   - `y` is initialized to 100000000, which is a large number but not necessarily the correct initial value. It should be initialized to a very large number or the first element of the array.

2. **Finding Maximum and Minimum**:
   - The loop correctly finds the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values in the array.

3. **Printing the Result**:
   - The program prints the difference `x - y`, which is the correct approach to find the maximum beauty of the array.

### Conclusion

The program logic is correct, but there are issues with the initialization of `x` and `y`. However, the logic to find the maximum and minimum values and then printing their difference is correct. Given the constraints, the program will still work correctly because the initial values of `x` and `y` will be overwritten by the actual maximum and minimum values in the array.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
