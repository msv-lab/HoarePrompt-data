Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than 0; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces; `e` is `e + 1`. If `nums[i]` is greater than 0, then `x` is set to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. `i` is incremented by 1. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x` before the if statement, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged. If `nums[i]` is less than `y` before the if statement, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if statement, considering both the condition being true and the condition being false (though there is no else part in this specific case).
