Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than 0; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces; `x` is 0; `y` is 100000000; `e` is `e + 1`; the current element `nums[i]` is greater than `x` (which is 0)**
