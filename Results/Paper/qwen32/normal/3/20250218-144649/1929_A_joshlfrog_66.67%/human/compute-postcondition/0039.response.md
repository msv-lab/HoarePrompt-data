Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than 0; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces; `e` is `e + 1`. If `nums[i]` is greater than 0, then `x` is set to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. `i` is incremented by 1. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x` before the if statement, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.**
