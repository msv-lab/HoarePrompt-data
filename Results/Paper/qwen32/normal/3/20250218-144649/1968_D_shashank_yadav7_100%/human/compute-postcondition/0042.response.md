To determine the output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to follow the logic of the loop and the given initial and intermediate states. The loop will execute `n` times, but it will terminate early if `k` becomes 0. Let's break down the changes that occur in each iteration:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `k` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `b` and `s` are updated to the indices specified by the list `p`.
   - `sp` and `bp` are cumulative sums of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively.
   - `bm` and `sm` are updated to the maximum value of their current value and the new calculated values.

2. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop terminates if `k` becomes 0.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - `i` will be equal to the number of iterations completed, which is the minimum of `n` and the number of iterations until `k` becomes 0.
   - `k` will be 0 if the loop terminated early, otherwise it will be `n - i`.
   - `b` and `s` will be the final indices after all iterations.
   - `sp` will be the sum of `a[s]` for all iterations.
   - `bp` will be the sum of `a[b]` for all iterations.
   - `bm` and `sm` will be the maximum values calculated during the iterations.

Given the pattern from the first three iterations, we can generalize the final state as follows:

- `i`: The number of iterations completed, which is `min(n, initial_k)`.
- `k`: `0` if the loop terminated early, otherwise `n - i`.
- `b`: The final value of `b` after all iterations.
- `s`: The final value of `s` after all iterations.
- `sp`: The cumulative sum of `a[s]` for all iterations.
- `bp`: The cumulative sum of `a[b]` for all iterations.
- `bm`: The maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for all iterations.
- `sm`: The maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for all iterations.

Let's express this in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n, initial_k)`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the loop terminated early, otherwise `n - i`, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations, `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` for all iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for all iterations.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have updated `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` according to the rules defined in the loop, and `k` will be 0 if it terminated early due to `k` reaching 0, otherwise it will be the remaining iterations left.
