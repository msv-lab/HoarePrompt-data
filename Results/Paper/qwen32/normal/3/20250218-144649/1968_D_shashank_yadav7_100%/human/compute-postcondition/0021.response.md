The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `bp` is initially `a[b]`. After the operation, `bp` becomes `a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[b]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` was true, otherwise `k` remains `k - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[p[s] - 1] * k, a[s] * k + sp)`**
