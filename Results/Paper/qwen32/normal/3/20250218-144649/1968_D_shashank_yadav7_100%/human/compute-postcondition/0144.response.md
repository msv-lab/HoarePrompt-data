To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the transformations that occur in each iteration.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n`: The first integer read from the input.
- `k`: The second integer read from the input.
- `b`: The third integer read from the input minus 1.
- `s`: The fourth integer read from the input minus 1.
- `sp`: `a[s]`
- `bp`: `a[b]`
- `bm`: `a[b] * k`
- `sm`: `a[s] * k`
- `p`: A list of integers read from the input.
- `a`: A list of integers read from the input.
- `i`: `i + 1` (Note: `i` starts at 0, so `i` is incremented by 1 before the loop starts)

### Loop Behavior:
The loop runs for `n` iterations unless `k` reaches 0, at which point it breaks. In each iteration:
- `k` is decremented by 1.
- `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`.
- `bm` is updated to `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
- `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.
- `sp` is incremented by `a[s]`.
- `bp` is incremented by `a[b]`.

### Final State Analysis:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`k`**: Could be 0 or `k - n` (if `k` does not reach 0 within `n` iterations).
- **`b`**: After `n` iterations, `b` will have been updated `n` times based on the values in `p`.
- **`s`**: After `n` iterations, `s` will have been updated `n` times based on the values in `p`.
- **`sp`**: After `n` iterations, `sp` will be the sum of `a[s]` values from each iteration.
- **`bp`**: After `n` iterations, `bp` will be the sum of `a[b]` values from each iteration.
- **`bm`**: After `n` iterations, `bm` will be the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` encountered.
- **`sm`**: After `n` iterations, `sm` will be the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` encountered.
- **`p`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`i`**: Will be `n` if the loop runs for `n` iterations, or the number of iterations it ran before `k` reached 0.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is either 0 or the second integer read from the input minus `n`, `b` is the result of applying `p[b] - 1` iteratively `n` times or until `k` reaches 0, `s` is the result of applying `p[s] - 1` iteratively `n` times or until `k` reaches 0, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` values from each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` values from each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` encountered, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` encountered, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is the number of iterations the loop ran.**

In simpler terms, the final state is determined by the cumulative effects of the loop iterations on `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm`, with `k` potentially reaching 0 before the loop completes all `n` iterations.
