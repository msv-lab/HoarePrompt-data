Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true (in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement), otherwise `k` retains its value as `n - i - 1`, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations minus 1, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations minus 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is 0.**
