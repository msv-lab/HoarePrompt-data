Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `b` is the third integer read from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer read from the input, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` across all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` across all iterations, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `b` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
