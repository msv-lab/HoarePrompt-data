Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1` (or if `k == 0` we break out of the most internal loop or if statement), `b` is `p[previous b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k + 1), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, `p`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
