The given code snippet updates the variable `sm` to the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` remains 0 if it was 0, otherwise `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, and `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.

In simpler terms, `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the new value `a[s] * k + sp`. All other variables retain their initial values.
