The code snippet updates the value of `sm` by comparing its current value with `a[s] * k + sp` and taking the maximum of the two.

Given the initial state, `sm` is initially set to `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`. After executing the line `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sm` will be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`.

Since `sm` is already defined as `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, and `a[s] * k + sp` is one of the terms in the initial definition of `sm`, the value of `sm` will not change after this line is executed.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the initial state for `sm`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1` (or if `k == 0` we break out of the most internal loop or if statement), `b` is `p[p[previous b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is 1. If `k == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
