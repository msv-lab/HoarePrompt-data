Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `b` is the third integer read from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer read from the input minus 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        break
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
    bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second integer read from the input minus 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[previous_s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k + 1), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 0. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either -1 or the second integer read from the input minus 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[previous_s] - 1] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp, a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next part of the code.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either -2 or the second integer read from the input minus 3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[p[previous_s] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next part of the code.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
