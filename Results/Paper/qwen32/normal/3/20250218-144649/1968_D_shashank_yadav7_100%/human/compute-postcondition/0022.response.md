The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it determines the total number of iterations.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` was true, otherwise `k` remains `k - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[p[s] - 1] * k, a[s] * k + sp)`**
