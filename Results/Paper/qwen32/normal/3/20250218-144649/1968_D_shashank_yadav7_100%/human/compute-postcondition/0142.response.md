The code snippet provided modifies the value of `sp` by adding `a[s]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either -2 or the second integer read from the input minus 3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[p[previous_s] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next part of the code.**

In simpler terms, `sp` has been updated to be `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
