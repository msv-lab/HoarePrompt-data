The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the loop statement, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. The value of `n` does not change in the loop head, so it remains greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` remains 0 if it was 0, otherwise `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**
