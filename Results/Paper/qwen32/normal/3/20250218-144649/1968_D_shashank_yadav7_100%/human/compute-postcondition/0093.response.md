To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how the variables evolve with each iteration. The loop continues until `k` becomes 0. Given the initial and intermediate states, we can infer how the variables change.

### Analysis of the Loop:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` starts at `min(n, initial_k) + 1`.
   - `k` starts at `n - i`.
   - `b` and `s` are indices into the list `p`.
   - `sp` and `bp` are cumulative sums starting from `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively.
   - `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`, respectively.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each iteration, `k` is decremented by 1.
   - If `k` becomes 0, the loop terminates.
   - `b` and `s` are updated to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, respectively.
   - `sp` and `bp` are updated by adding `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively.
   - `bm` and `sm` are updated to the maximum of their current values and the new values `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`.

### Final Output State:
Given the initial and intermediate states, we can deduce the final state after all iterations.

- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early. Otherwise, it will be the point where `k` becomes 0.
- **`k`**: `k` will be 0 if the loop completes all iterations or if it breaks early.
- **`b`**: `b` will be updated `k` times based on the values in `p`.
- **`s`**: `s` will be updated `k` times based on the values in `p`.
- **`sp`**: `sp` will be the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
- **`bp`**: `bp` will be the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
- **`bm`**: `bm` will be the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` across all iterations.
- **`sm`**: `sm` will be the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` across all iterations.
- **`p` and `a`**: These lists remain unchanged throughout the loop.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations minus 1, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations minus 1, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` across all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` across all iterations, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations or the point where `k` becomes 0.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `k` becomes 0, `b` and `s` are updated based on the list `p`, `sp` and `bp` are cumulative sums of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, `bm` and `sm` are the maximum values of the respective expressions, and `i` reflects the number of iterations completed.
