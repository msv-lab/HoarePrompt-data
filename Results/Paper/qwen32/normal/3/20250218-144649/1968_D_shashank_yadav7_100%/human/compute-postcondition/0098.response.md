The given initial state describes a set of variables and conditions, but the specific values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, `p`, `a`, and `i` are not explicitly provided. The only statement we need to evaluate is `print('Sasha')`.

The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the provided variables. It simply prints the string 'Sasha'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Sasha**
