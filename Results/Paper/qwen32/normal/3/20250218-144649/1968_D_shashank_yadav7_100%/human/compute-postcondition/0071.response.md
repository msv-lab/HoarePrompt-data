The code snippet `sp += a[s]` modifies the value of `sp` by adding the value of `a[s]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true (in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement), otherwise `k` retains its value as `n - i - 1`, `b` is `p[previous b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k + 1), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is 0.**

In natural language: The value of `sp` is now the sum of its previous value and `a[s]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
