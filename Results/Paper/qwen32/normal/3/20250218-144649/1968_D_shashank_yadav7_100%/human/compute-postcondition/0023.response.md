Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `k` remains 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `bm` remains the same, `sm` is `max(a[p[s] - 1] * (k - 1), a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `sm` remains the same.**

In simpler terms, `k` is decremented by 1 if it was not already 0. The values of `bm` and `sm` are recalculated based on the new value of `k` if `k` was not 0; otherwise, they remain unchanged. All other variables retain their previous values.
