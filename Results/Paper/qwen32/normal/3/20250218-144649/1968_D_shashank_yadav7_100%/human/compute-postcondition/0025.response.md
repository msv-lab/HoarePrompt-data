Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` remains 0 if it was 0, otherwise `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` remains the same if `k` was 0, otherwise `bm` is updated to `max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`, and `sm` remains the same if `k` was 0, otherwise `sm` is updated to `max(a[p[s] - 1] * (k - 1), a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)`**
