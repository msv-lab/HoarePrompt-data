Output State: **`t` is `t + 1` such that `t > 0`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element or `b` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `len_a` is the length of the list `a`, `len_b` is the length of the list `b`, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `len_a > i + 1` and `a[i] <= k`, then `count_a` is `count_a + 1`. `count_b` is `count_b + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `count_b` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
