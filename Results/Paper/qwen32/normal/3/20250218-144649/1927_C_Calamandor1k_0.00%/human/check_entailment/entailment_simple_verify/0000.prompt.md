You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES

    YES
    YES

    NO
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays in such a way that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included among the chosen elements. 

The main issue is that the program only checks if there are at least \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements in each array that are less than or equal to \(k\). However, it does not ensure that the chosen elements from both arrays together cover all integers from 1 to \(k\).

Here is a counterexample where the program will output "YES" but the correct answer should be "NO":

**Input:**
```
1
3 3 4
1 2 3
5 6 7
```
**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```
**Program Output:**
```
YES
```

In this example, the program incorrectly concludes that it is possible to choose elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to 4 is included. However, the only elements available from the first array are 1, 2, and 3, and there are no elements from the second array that are less than or equal to 4. Therefore, it is impossible to choose elements that cover all integers from 1 to 4.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Count the occurrences of each number up to \(k\) in both arrays.
2. Ensure that for each number from 1 to \(k\), there are enough occurrences in total from both arrays to cover the requirement of \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = k // 2
        
        from collections import Counter
        count_a = Counter(a)
        count_b = Counter(b)
        
        possible = True
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            if count_a[i] + count_b[i] < d:
                possible = False
                break
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that for each integer from 1 to \(k\), there are enough occurrences in total from both arrays to satisfy the condition.
