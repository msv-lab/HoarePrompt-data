The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, an even integer `k`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a list `b` of `m` integers. For each test case, it checks if at least half of the elements in both lists `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k`. It prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
