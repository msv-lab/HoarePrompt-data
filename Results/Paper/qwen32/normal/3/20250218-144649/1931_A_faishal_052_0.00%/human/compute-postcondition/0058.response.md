The value of `lex` is reduced by 26. Given that `lex` was initially greater than 51, after subtracting 26, `lex` is still greater than 25. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an integer greater than 25, `j` is 0, `k` is 3**
