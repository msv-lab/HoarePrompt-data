The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is used in the `range(2)` function. The loop will execute if `j` starts from a value that is less than 2, and the `range(2)` function will generate values 0 and 1 for `j`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78
- `arr` is an empty list
- `lex` is the integer value provided by the user
- `j` is 1
- `k` is 3

To ensure the loop executes, `j` must be set to a value less than 2. Since the loop uses `range(2)`, `j` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is the integer value provided by the user, `j` is 0, `k` is 3**
