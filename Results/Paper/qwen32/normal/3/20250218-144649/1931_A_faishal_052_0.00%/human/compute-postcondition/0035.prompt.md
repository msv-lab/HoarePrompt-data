Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, and `arr` is a list containing a single element. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is greater than 25, `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is less than 52, then `lex` is an integer between 1 and 26. Otherwise, `lex` is an integer greater than 51.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 1 if `lex` (initially) is less than or equal to 25, or 26 if `lex` (initially) is greater than 25, and the second element is 1 if `lex` was initially between 1 and 26, or 26 otherwise, `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 26, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 25 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25, or `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex` was initially greater than 25, `lex` is modified to be between -26 and 50 if it was initially between 1 and 51, or greater than 25 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1. If `lex` was initially between 1 and 26, `lex` is now `lex - 1`. If `lex` was initially between 27 and 51, `lex` is now between 1 and 25. If `lex` was initially greater than 51, it remains greater than 25. If `lex` was initially greater than 26, a third element 26 is added to `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
