Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 1 if `lex` (initially) is less than or equal to 25, or 26 if `lex` (initially) is greater than 25, and the second element is 1 if `lex` was initially between 1 and 26, or 26 otherwise, `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 26, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 25 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1.**
