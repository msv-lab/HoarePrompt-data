Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, and `arr` is a list containing a single element. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is greater than 25, `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is less than 52, then `lex` is an integer between 1 and 26. Otherwise, `lex` is an integer greater than 51.**
