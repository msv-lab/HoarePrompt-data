Given the initial state and the operation `lex = lex - 26`, we need to calculate the new value of `lex` based on its previous range and adjust accordingly.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 2
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78
- `arr` is either [1, 1, 26] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, [26, 1, 26] if `lex` was between 26 and 51, or [1, 26, 26] or [26, 26, 26] if `lex` was 52 or greater
- `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` - 1 < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 27` if it was 52 or greater
- `j` is 2
- `k` is 3

The operation `lex = lex - 26` affects the value of `lex` as follows:
- If `lex` was originally in the range 1 to 25, after `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be in the range -25 to -1.
- If `lex` was originally in the range 26 to 51, after `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be in the range 0 to 25.
- If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, after `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be 26 or greater.

Since `lex` was adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` - 1 < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 27` if it was 52 or greater, we need to consider these adjustments:
- If `lex` was originally in the range 1 to 25, `lex` was adjusted to be in the range 0 to 24. After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be in the range -26 to -2.
- If `lex` was originally in the range 26 to 51, `lex` was adjusted to be in the range 1 to 25. After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be in the range -25 to -1.
- If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `lex` was adjusted to be `lex - 27`. After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be `lex - 53` which is still 26 or greater minus 26, resulting in 0 or greater.

However, since the problem specifies that `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` - 1 < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 27` if it was 52 or greater, and the operation `lex = lex - 26` is applied, we need to ensure `lex` remains valid after this operation.

Therefore, the new value of `lex` will be:
- If `lex` was originally in the range 1 to 25, `lex` was adjusted to be in the range 0 to 24. After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be in the range -26 to -2.
- If `lex` was originally in the range 26 to 51, `lex` was adjusted to be in the range 1 to 25. After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be in the range -25 to -1.
- If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `lex` was adjusted to be `lex - 27`. After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be `lex - 53` which is 0 or greater.

Since the problem specifies that `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` - 1 < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 27` if it was 52 or greater, and the operation `lex = lex - 26` is applied, we need to ensure `lex` remains valid after this operation.

Therefore, the new value of `lex` will be in the range -25 to -1 if it was originally in the range 1 to 51, and `lex - 53` if it was originally 52 or greater.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26] if `lex + 26` was less than or equal to 25, [26, 1, 26] if `lex + 26` was between 26 and 51, or [1, 26, 26] or [26, 26, 26] if `lex + 26` was 52 or greater, `lex` is in the range -25 to -1 if it was originally in the range 1 to 51, or `lex - 53` if it was originally 52 or greater, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3.**
