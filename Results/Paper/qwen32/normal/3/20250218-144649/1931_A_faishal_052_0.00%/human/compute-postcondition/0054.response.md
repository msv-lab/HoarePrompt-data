Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is [26], `lex` is the integer value provided by the user and `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, `j` is 0, `k` is 3**.

The list `arr` now contains the integer `26`. All other variables retain their initial values.
