The code snippet `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. After this operation, `arr` will have one more element, which is the value of `lex`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing either [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], [26, 1, lex], or [26, 26, lex] based on the initial value of `lex`, `lex` is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on the initial value of `lex`, `j` is 2, `k` is 3.**
