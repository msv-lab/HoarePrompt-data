Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `cases` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
   - `arr` is one of the following lists: 
     - [1, 1, lex]
     - [lex, 1, 1]
     - [1, lex, 26]
     - [lex, 1, 26]
     - [1, 26, lex]
     - [lex, 26, 26]
     - [26, 26, lex]
   - `lex` is adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 0.

2. **Code to Execute:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `k` is 0, so `arr[k]` refers to the first element of `arr`.
   - The first element of `arr` can be one of the following values based on the possible lists:
     - 1
     - lex
     - 1
     - lex
     - 1
     - lex
     - 26
   - Given that `lex` is adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51, we need to consider the valid values for `chr(arr[k] + 96)`:
     - If `arr[k]` is 1, then `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is 'a'.
     - If `arr[k]` is 26, then `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is 'z'.
     - If `arr[k]` is `lex`, then `chr(lex + 96)` will be a character corresponding to the ASCII value of `lex + 96`. Since `lex` is in the range -25 to 51, `lex + 96` will be in the range 71 to 147. However, only values from 97 to 122 (which correspond to 'a' to 'z') are valid ASCII values for lowercase letters. Therefore, `lex` must be in the range -25 to 26 for `chr(lex + 96)` to be a lowercase letter.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The first element of `arr` can be 1, 26, or `lex` (where `lex` is in the range -25 to 26).
   - If `arr[k]` is 1, the output will be 'a'.
   - If `arr[k]` is 26, the output will be 'z'.
   - If `arr[k]` is `lex` (where `lex` is in the range -25 to 26), the output will be a character from 'a' to 'z' corresponding to `chr(lex + 96)`.

Since the exact value of `lex` is not provided and it can vary within the specified range, we need to describe the output in terms of the possible values.

Output: **a or z or a character from 'a' to 'z' (where the character is determined by the value of `lex` + 96, and `lex` is in the range -25 to 26)**
