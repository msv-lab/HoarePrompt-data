Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine the lexicographically smallest three-letter word from the given encoded integer. However, there are several issues in the logic that prevent it from achieving the correct results for all possible inputs.

1. **Incorrect Handling of Values Greater Than 26**:
   - The program only correctly handles values up to 52. For values greater than 52, it should continue to distribute the remaining value across the three letters, but it does not do so correctly. For example, if `lex` is 70, the program should distribute the values to get 'rzz', but it might not do so correctly due to the current logic.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The program sorts the array `arr` after assigning values to it. This step is unnecessary and incorrect because the goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word, which requires the smallest possible values for the first letter, then the second, and finally the third. Sorting can disrupt this order.

3. **Logic for Assigning Values**:
   - The program uses a loop to assign values to the first two letters and then assigns the remaining value to the third letter. This approach does not guarantee the smallest possible letters for the first two positions, which is crucial for finding the lexicographically smallest word.

To correct the program, the logic should be adjusted to ensure that the smallest possible values are assigned to the first two letters first, and the remaining value is assigned to the third letter. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the array with the smallest possible values
        arr = [1, 1, lex - 2]
        # Ensure the values are within the range 1-26
        for j in range(2, -1, -1):
            if arr[j] > 26:
                excess = arr[j] - 26
                arr[j] = 26
                arr[j-1] += excess
        # Print the result
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided code is:

Correctness: **False**
