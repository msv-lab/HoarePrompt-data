The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Given the initial conditions, `lex` can be in three different ranges:
1. If `lex` was between 1 and 25, after subtracting 26, `lex` will be between -25 and -1.
2. If `lex` was between 26 and 51, after subtracting 26, `lex` will be between 0 and 25.
3. If `lex` was greater than 51, after subtracting 26, `lex` will be greater than 25.

The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is either 1 or 26 and the second element is 26, `lex` is an integer such that if lex is less than or equal to -1, lex is between -25 and -1, if lex is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 25, lex is between 0 and 25, if lex is greater than 25, lex is greater than 25, `j` is 1.**
