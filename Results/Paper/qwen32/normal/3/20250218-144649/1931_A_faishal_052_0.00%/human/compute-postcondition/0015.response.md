Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, and `lex` is an integer greater than 25. If `lex` is less than 52, then `lex` is an integer between 1 and 26. Otherwise, `lex` is an integer greater than 51.**
