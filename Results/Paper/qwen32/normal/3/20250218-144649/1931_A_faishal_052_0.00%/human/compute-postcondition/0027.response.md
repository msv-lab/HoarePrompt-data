The code snippet `arr.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `arr`. This means that the list `arr`, which initially contained two elements, will now contain three elements.

Given the initial state, `arr` was a list with two elements:
- The first element is `1` if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25, or `26` if `lex` was initially greater than 25.
- The second element is `1` if `lex` was initially between 1 and 26, or `26` otherwise.

After appending `1` to `arr`, the new list `arr` will be:
- If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25, `arr` will be `[1, 1, 1]`.
- If `lex` was initially between 26 and 51, `arr` will be `[26, 26, 1]`.
- If `lex` was initially greater than 51, `arr` will be `[26, 26, 1]`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `lex`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25, or `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex` was initially greater than 25, `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 26, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 25 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1**.
