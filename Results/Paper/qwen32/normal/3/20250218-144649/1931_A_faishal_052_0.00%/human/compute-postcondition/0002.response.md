The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `arr`. The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is an empty list.**
