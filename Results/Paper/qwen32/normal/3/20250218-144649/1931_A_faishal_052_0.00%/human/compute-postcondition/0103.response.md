Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 (specifically, if `lex` was originally less than 52, `lex` is now in the range 0 < `lex` < 26; otherwise, `lex` is `lex - 26`), `j` is 0, `k` is 3.**
