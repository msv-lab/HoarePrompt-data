Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an input integer greater than 25.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, so if `lex` was initially greater than 51, it is now greater than 25. All other variables remain unchanged.
