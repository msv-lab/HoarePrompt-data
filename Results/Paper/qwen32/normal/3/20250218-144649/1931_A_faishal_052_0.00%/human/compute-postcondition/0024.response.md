Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is either 1 or 26 depending on the original value of `lex`, and the second element is 26, `lex` is modified to be between -25 and 25 if it was originally less than 52, otherwise it is greater than 25, `j` is 1.**
