To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
   - `arr` is a list sorted in ascending order based on the initial value of `lex`.
   - `lex` is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on the initial value of `lex`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 0.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```
   - `k` is 0, so `arr[k]` refers to the first element of the list `arr`.
   - The `chr` function converts an ASCII value to its corresponding character.
   - `arr[k] + 96` means the ASCII value of the character is the first element of `arr` plus 96.

3. **Value of `arr[k]`**:
   - `arr` is a list sorted in ascending order based on the initial value of `lex`.
   - `lex` is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on its initial value. This means `lex` could be one of these reduced values or any other value depending on the initial value.
   - Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order based on the initial value of `lex`, the first element of `arr` (`arr[0]`) will be the smallest possible value after the reduction.

4. **Determining the Character**:
   - The smallest possible value of `lex` after reduction could be 1 (if `lex` was initially 2, 29, or 53).
   - If `arr[0]` is 1, then `chr(arr[0] + 96)` becomes `chr(1 + 96)` which is `chr(97)`.
   - `chr(97)` corresponds to the character 'a'.

Given the above steps and the initial state, the first element of `arr` after sorting and reduction is likely to be 1, making `chr(arr[0] + 96)` equal to 'a'.

Output: **a**
