Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the program does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for a given encoded integer.

Let's analyze the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.
3. It initializes an empty list `arr` and then enters a loop to handle the first two characters of the word.
4. Inside the loop, it checks if `lex` is less than or equal to 26 and appends 1 to `arr` if true, otherwise it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts the corresponding value from `lex`.
5. After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
6. It sorts `arr` and then converts each number in `arr` to its corresponding character by adding 96 (which should be 96 to get 'a' for 1, but it's actually 97 in ASCII, so it should be `chr(arr[k] + 96)` should be `chr(arr[k] + 97)`).
7. It prints the characters without a newline in between.

The main issue with the program is the approach to constructing the word. The program does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `lex`. For example:

- If `lex` is 70, the program will output `rzz`, but the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 70 is `azz`.
- If `lex` is 55, the program will output `czz`, but the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 55 is `bzz`.

Here's a specific example that demonstrates the issue:

For `lex = 70`:
- The program will first add two 26s to `arr` (since `lex` is greater than 52), then append `lex - 52 = 18` to `arr`.
- It then sorts `arr` to get `[18, 26, 26]` and converts these to characters, resulting in `rzz`.
- However, the correct lexicographically smallest word for 70 is `azz` (1 + 26 + 43 = 70).

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for a given encoded integer.
