The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range it iterates over, which is `2`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `1`.

The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `lex`, `k`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing either the integer 1 or the integer 26, `lex` is an integer greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**
