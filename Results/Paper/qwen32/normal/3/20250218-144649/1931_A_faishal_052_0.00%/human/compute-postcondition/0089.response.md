The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `cases` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The value of `cases` must remain greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list sorted in ascending order based on the initial value of `lex`, `lex` is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on the initial value of `lex`, `j` is 2, `k` is 3**
