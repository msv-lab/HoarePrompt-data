The code snippet assigns an empty list to the variable `arr`. This means that the previous contents of `arr` are discarded and `arr` is now an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on the initial value of `lex`, `j` is 2, `k` is 3.**
