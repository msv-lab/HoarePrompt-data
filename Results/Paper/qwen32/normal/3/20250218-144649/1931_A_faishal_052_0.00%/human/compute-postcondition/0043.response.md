To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
   - `arr` is sorted based on the initial value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` is between 1 and 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`.
     - If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `arr` is `[lex - 26, 26, 26]`.
     - If `lex` is greater than 51, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`.
   - `lex` is modified:
     - If `lex` is between 1 and 51, it is adjusted to be between 0 and 25 (if between 1 and 25) or between -25 and 25 (if between 26 and 51).
     - If `lex` is greater than 51, it remains greater than 51.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `k` is 2.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.
   - `k` is 2, so we need to evaluate `arr[2]`.
   - Based on the definition of `arr`:
     - If `lex` is between 1 and 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, so `arr[2]` is `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `arr` is `[lex - 26, 26, 26]`, so `arr[2]` is `26`.
     - If `lex` is greater than 51, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`, so `arr[2]` is `lex`.

3. **Character Conversion**:
   - The `chr()` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - The ASCII value for lowercase 'a' is 97, so `chr(arr[k] + 96)` converts `arr[k]` to the corresponding lowercase letter.
   - If `lex` is between 1 and 25, `arr[2]` is `lex`, and `chr(lex + 96)` will be the corresponding lowercase letter from 'a' to 'y'.
   - If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `arr[2]` is `26`, and `chr(26 + 96)` will be the corresponding lowercase letter 'z'.
   - If `lex` is greater than 51, `arr[2]` is `lex`, and `chr(lex + 96)` will be a character beyond 'z', which is not a standard lowercase letter but a valid ASCII character.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output the character corresponding to `arr[2] + 96`.
   - Since the exact value of `lex` is not provided, we describe the output based on the conditions given.

Output: **the character corresponding to `arr[2] + 96` (where `arr[2]` is `lex` if `lex` is between 1 and 25, 26 if `lex` is between 26 and 51, or `lex` if `lex` is greater than 51)**
