The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it represents the total number of iterations the loop should perform.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index 1 is increased by 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**
