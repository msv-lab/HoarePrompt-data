The code snippet increases the element at index `i` in the list `a` by `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of the list `a` will be increased by 3.

Initial State: `a` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index 1 is increased by 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2.

Impact: The element at index 2 of the list `a` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index 1 is increased by 2 and the element at index 2 is increased by 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2.**
