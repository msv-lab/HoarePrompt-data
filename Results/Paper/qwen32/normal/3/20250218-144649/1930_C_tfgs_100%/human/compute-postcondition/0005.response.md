The code snippet `a[i] += i + 1` modifies the element at index `i` in the list `a` by adding `i + 1` to its current value. Given the initial state where `a` is a list of `n` integers and `i` is 1, the element at index `i` (which is the second element of the list, since indexing starts at 0) will be increased by `1 + 1 = 2`.

Therefore, the element at index `1` of the list `a` will increase by 2. All other elements and the value of `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index 1 is increased by 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**.
