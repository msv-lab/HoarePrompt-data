Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
1. We have an array `a` of length `n` and an empty set `S`.
2. We perform the following operations `n` times:
   - Select an index `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ |a|).
   - Insert `a[i] + i` into `S`.
   - Delete `a[i]` from `a`.
3. After `n` operations, `a` will be empty.
4. We construct a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order.
5. We need to find the lexicographically largest `b` that can be made.

### Analysis of the Program

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the lexicographically largest `b`. Here are the issues:

1. **Selection of Index `i`:**
   - The problem requires strategic selection of `i` to maximize the lexicographically largest `b`. However, the program does not implement any strategy for selecting `i`. It simply adds `a[i] + i` for all `i` in a loop, which is not optimal.

2. **Handling of Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of occurrences of elements in `a` after adding `i`. However, the strategy to handle duplicates and ensure the lexicographically largest `b` is not correctly implemented. The program just sorts the unique elements and appends additional elements based on some logic, but this logic does not guarantee the optimal `b`.

3. **Constructing `b`:**
   - The program sorts the unique elements in decreasing order and then appends additional elements based on the count of duplicates. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting `b` is the lexicographically largest possible.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Select the index `i` such that `a[i] + i` is maximized in each step.
- Insert `a[i] + i` into `S`.
- Delete `a[i]` from `a`.
- After all operations, sort `S` in decreasing order to get `b`.

The program should implement a strategy to always choose the maximum possible value of `a[i] + i` in each step.

### Conclusion
Given the issues with the program's logic and the fact that it does not implement the correct strategy for selecting `i` to maximize `b`, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
