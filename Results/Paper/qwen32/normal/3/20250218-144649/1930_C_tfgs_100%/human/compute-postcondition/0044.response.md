The given code snippet decrements the count of the current element `a[i]` in the `counter` object by 1. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1, `cur` is updated to `cur + counter[a[i]]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` now includes `a[i]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The count of the current element `a[i]` in the `counter` object is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
