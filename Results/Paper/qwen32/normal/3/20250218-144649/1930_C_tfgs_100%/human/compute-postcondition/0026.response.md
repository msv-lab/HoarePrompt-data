The code snippet `cur -= adv` decrements the value of `cur` by the value of `adv`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `n` is greater than `len(a)`, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is `cur - adv`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv`, `ans` is a list with `adv` elements, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1`, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt)`**

In natural language: The value of `cur` has been decreased by `adv`. All other variables retain their initial values.
