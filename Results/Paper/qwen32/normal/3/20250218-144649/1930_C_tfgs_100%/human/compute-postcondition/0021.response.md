The code snippet appends a new element to the list `ans`. Specifically, it appends the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to `ans`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` initially contains one element, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. After the execution of the code snippet, `ans` will contain two elements: the original element and the newly appended element, both of which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1] > a[i] + 1`, `n` is greater than `len(a)`, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list with two elements, both equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `j` is 1**.
