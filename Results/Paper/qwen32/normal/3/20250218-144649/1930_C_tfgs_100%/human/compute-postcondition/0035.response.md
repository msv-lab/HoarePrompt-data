The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has taken on a value that is one less than `adv` (since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`adv` is a positive integer; `ans` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`; `j` is incremented by 1**  
Since `j` was the previous value that allowed the loop to run, and it needs to be incremented for the next iteration, we simply need to increase `j` by 1.

State: **`adv` is a positive integer; `ans` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`; `j` is `j + 1`**  
To be more precise and clear:

State: **`adv` is a positive integer; `ans` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`; `j` is incremented by 1**  
Or more formally:

State: **`adv` is a positive integer; `ans` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`; `j` is `j + 1`**
