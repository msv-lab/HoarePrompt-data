The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list of integers obtained from the input. The list contains `n` integers, where `n` is the length of the array, and each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9. The values of `n` and the precondition that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input; `n` is an input integer; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
