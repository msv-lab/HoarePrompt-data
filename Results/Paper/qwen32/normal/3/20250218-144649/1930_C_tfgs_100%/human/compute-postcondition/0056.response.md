The code snippet `cur -= adv` decrements the value of `cur` by the value of `adv`. The other variables (`i`, `adv`, `j`, `ans`, and `cnt`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `adv` is `adv`, `j` is `adv`, `ans` has `adv` new elements appended to it, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `cur` is `cur - adv`**.
