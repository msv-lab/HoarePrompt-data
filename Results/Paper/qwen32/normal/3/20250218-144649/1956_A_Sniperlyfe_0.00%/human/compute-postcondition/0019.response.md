The code snippet `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to `qs`. This means that the previous value of `qs` is overwritten with the new list of integers obtained from the input.

The other variables (`k`, `q`, `n`, `p`, `res`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the last element in the new `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are in the new `qs`, with each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the new `qs`.**
