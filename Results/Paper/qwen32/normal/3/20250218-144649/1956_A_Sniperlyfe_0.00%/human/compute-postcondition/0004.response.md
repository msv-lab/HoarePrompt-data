The code reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `qs`. The values of `n`, `p`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
