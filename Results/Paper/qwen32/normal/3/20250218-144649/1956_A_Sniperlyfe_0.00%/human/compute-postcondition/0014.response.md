To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: The next element in the list `qs`.
2. **`p`**: A list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round.
3. **`k`**: The first input integer.
4. **`q`**: The second input integer.
5. **`qs`**: A list of integers that must contain at least two elements.
6. **`res`**: A list containing three elements, each of which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Explanation:
- **`map(str, res)`**: This converts each element in the list `res` to a string.
- **`' '.join(...)`**: This joins the string representations of the elements in `res` with a space `' '` in between.

### Key Points:
- The value of `res` is a list of three elements, each computed by `func_1(n, p)`.
- Since the precise definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`.
- However, we know that `res` is a list of three elements, and each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the string representation of the elements in `res` joined by spaces. Since we do not have the exact values of `res` due to the unknown definition of `func_1`, the output will be described in terms of the elements of `res`.

Output: **res[0] res[1] res[2] (where each res[i] is the result of func_1(n, p))**
