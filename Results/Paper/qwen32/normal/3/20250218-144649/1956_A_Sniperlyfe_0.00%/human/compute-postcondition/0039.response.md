The only variable in the loop head is `n`, which is being iterated over the list `qs`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `n` to the next element in `qs`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `k` is the first integer from the input (unchanged).
- `q` is the second integer from the input (unchanged).
- `n` is the last element in the new `qs` (this will change to the next element in `qs`).
- `p` is a new list of integers read from the input (unchanged).
- `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element (unchanged).
- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` (unchanged).
- `t` is at least 1 (unchanged).

Since `n` is the last element in `qs` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `n` should be the next element in `qs`. We do not know the exact elements in `qs`, but we know that `qs` has at least one element, and `n` has just been the last element of the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least one more element.

State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the next element in `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is at least 1**
