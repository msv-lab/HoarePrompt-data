The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. The loop variable `_` is simply used to iterate `t` times, and it doesn't influence any other variables in the program state.

Since the loop body is omitted, we can infer that the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body to modify any other variables. Therefore, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is the last element in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are in `qs`, with each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`**
