To determine what will be printed by the `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **k**: The first integer from the input.
2. **q**: The second integer from the input.
3. **n**: The last element in the list `qs`.
4. **p**: A new list of integers read from the input.
5. **qs**: A new list of integers obtained from the input, and it must have at least one element.
6. **res**: A list containing the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
7. **t**: At least 1 (though `t` is not used in the given print statement).

The `print` statement will output a space-separated string of the elements in the `res` list, where each element is converted to a string.

Since the function `func_1(n, p)` is not defined in the initial state, we can't determine the exact values of the elements in `res`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the result of this function.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Retrieve `n`**: `n` is the last element of the list `qs`.
2. **Retrieve `p`**: `p` is a list of integers read from the input.
3. **Compute `res`**: `res` is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
4. **Print `res`**: The `print` statement converts each element of `res` to a string and joins them with spaces.

### Output Description:
Since `res` is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, we can describe the printed output as the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the result of func_1(n, p) converted to a space-separated string)**
