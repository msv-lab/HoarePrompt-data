### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The main function, `func_2`, handles input reading and output formatting, while `func_1` performs the core logic of determining the number of players remaining after the game rounds.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To determine the number of players remaining after the rounds of kicking out players based on the positions specified in `p`.
- **Logic**: It iteratively reduces the number of players `n` by the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. This process continues until `n` is less than the smallest value in `p`. The final value of `n` represents the number of players remaining.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To read input, process each test case, and print the results.
- **Logic**: It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of positions `k`, the number of initial player counts `q`, the list of positions `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`. For each initial player count in `qs`, it calls `func_1` and prints the result.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly reduces the number of players by the count of positions that are within the current player count `n`. This aligns with the problem description where players at specific positions are removed in each round.
  - The loop continues until `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`, which ensures that no more players can be removed.
  - The final value of `n` is the number of players remaining after all possible rounds.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case independently.
  - It calls `func_1` for each initial player count and prints the results, which aligns with the problem's requirement to output the number of winners for each initial player count.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work together to correctly solve the problem. `func_1` handles the core logic of determining the number of remaining players, and `func_2` manages input and output. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
