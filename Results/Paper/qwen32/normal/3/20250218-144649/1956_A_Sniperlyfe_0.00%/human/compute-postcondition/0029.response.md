To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to understand the values and relationships of the variables involved based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **k**: The first integer from the input.
2. **q**: The second integer from the input.
3. **n**: The next element in the list `qs`.
4. **p**: A list of integers read from the input.
5. **qs**: A list that must have at least one more element (implying it has at least two elements).
6. **res**: A list containing two identical elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Key Points:
- `res` is a list with two elements, both of which are the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
- The `print` statement uses `' '.join(map(str, res))` to convert each element of `res` to a string and then joins them with a space.

### Output Explanation:
- Since `res` contains two identical elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the output will be the string representation of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the string representation of `func_1(n, p)` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p) (where func_1(n, p) is the result of the function func_1 applied to n and p)**
