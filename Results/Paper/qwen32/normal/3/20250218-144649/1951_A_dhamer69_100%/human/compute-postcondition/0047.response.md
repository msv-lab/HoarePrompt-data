Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, then the specific actions of the if block are taken (which are not detailed here). Otherwise, the specific actions of the else block are taken (which are not detailed here), but the variables retain their initial conditions.**
