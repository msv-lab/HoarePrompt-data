Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a new input string.
- `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('NO')
```

**Analysis:**
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'NO'` directly. The values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference these variables.

**Output:**
The code will print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
