The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state provides information about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the print statement**: The statement is `print('YES')`.
2. **Analyze the string**: The string 'YES' is explicitly provided and does not depend on any variables.
3. **Determine the output**: Since the string 'YES' is directly printed, the output will be exactly 'YES'.

Given this, the final output is:

Output: **YES**
