The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer, and we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
