Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2; `s` is an input string; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`, and `count_1` is even. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, then the conditions specific to the if part are met. Otherwise, either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2.**
