Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the conditions remain as specified. If `count_1` is even and (`s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`), the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, the conditions remain as specified.**

This can be summarized more clearly as:
Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, no additional changes occur. If `count_1` is even, and `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' with `count_1` equal to 2, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.**
