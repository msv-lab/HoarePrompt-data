Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 0.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged and still satisfy the condition that `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The variable `t` is now 0, indicating that the loop has executed the number of times specified by its initial value and has terminated. The variables `n` and `s` do not have a specific state mentioned because they are input values that change with each iteration and do not persist after the loop ends.
