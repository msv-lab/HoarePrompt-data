Let's analyze the provided code to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Fireworks from two installations are launched at different intervals and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a and m < b:
            print(2)
        elif m < a and m > b:
            print(2 + m // b)
        elif m < b and m > a:
            print(2 + m // a)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

### Analysis
The provided code attempts to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time based on the intervals `a` and `b` and the visibility duration `m`. However, the logic in the code does not correctly address the problem requirements.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Fireworks Overlap:** The code does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. Specifically, it does not consider the cases where multiple fireworks from different installations could be visible at the same time due to their visibility duration `m`.
2. **Edge Cases:** The code does not handle edge cases where `a` and `b` are very large, or where `m` is large compared to `a` and `b`.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any point in time. This involves considering the periodicity of the fireworks from both installations and their visibility duration.

### Counterexample
Let's consider a counterexample to show that the provided code is incorrect.

#### Counterexample:
```
Input:
1
2 3 5

Expected Output:
4

Explanation:
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times 3, 6, 9, 12, ...
- At time 6, fireworks from both installations are visible.
- At time 5, fireworks launched at time 2 and 3 are visible.
- At time 6, fireworks launched at time 2, 3, 4, and 6 are visible.
- At time 7, fireworks launched at time 2, 3, 4, and 6 are visible.
- At time 8, fireworks launched at time 4 and 6 are visible.
- At time 9, fireworks launched at time 6 and 9 are visible.
- At time 10, fireworks launched at time 6 and 10 are visible.

Thus, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 4.
```

#### Code Output for Counterexample:
The provided code will output `2 + 5 // 3 = 3` for this input, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements and fails in the given counterexample.

Correctness: **False**.
