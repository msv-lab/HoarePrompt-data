Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers where `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 10^18), and `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^18).**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the input operation.
