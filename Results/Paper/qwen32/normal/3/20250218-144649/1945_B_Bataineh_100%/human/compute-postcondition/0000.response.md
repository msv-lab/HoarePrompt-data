`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the code. The number of test cases, `t`, is now a specific integer value provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18); `b` is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 10^18); `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^18)**.
