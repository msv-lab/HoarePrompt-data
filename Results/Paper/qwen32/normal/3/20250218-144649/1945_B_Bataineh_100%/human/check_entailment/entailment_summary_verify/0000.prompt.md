You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

    2000000000000000002
    
Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a and m < b:
            print(2)
        elif m < a and m > b:
            print(2 + m // b)
        elif m < b and m > a:
            print(2 + m // a)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of moments in time when fireworks from both installations are visible in the sky simultaneously.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Fireworks from two installations are launched at different intervals and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a and m < b:
            print(2)
        elif m < a and m > b:
            print(2 + m // b)
        elif m < b and m > a:
            print(2 + m // a)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

### Analysis
The provided code attempts to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time based on the intervals `a` and `b` and the visibility duration `m`. However, the logic in the code does not correctly address the problem requirements.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Fireworks Overlap:** The code does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. Specifically, it does not consider the cases where multiple fireworks from different installations could be visible at the same time due to their visibility duration `m`.
2. **Edge Cases:** The code does not handle edge cases where `a` and `b` are very large, or where `m` is large compared to `a` and `b`.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any point in time. This involves considering the periodicity of the fireworks from both installations and their visibility duration.

### Counterexample
Let's consider a counterexample to show that the provided code is incorrect.

#### Counterexample:
```
Input:
1
2 3 5

Expected Output:
4

Explanation:
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times 3, 6, 9, 12, ...
- At time 6, fireworks from both installations are visible.
- At time 5, fireworks launched at time 2 and 3 are visible.
- At time 6, fireworks launched at time 2, 3, 4, and 6 are visible.
- At time 7, fireworks launched at time 2, 3, 4, and 6 are visible.
- At time 8, fireworks launched at time 4 and 6 are visible.
- At time 9, fireworks launched at time 6 and 9 are visible.
- At time 10, fireworks launched at time 6 and 10 are visible.

Thus, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 4.
```

#### Code Output for Counterexample:
The provided code will output `2 + 5 // 3 = 3` for this input, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements and fails in the given counterexample.

Correctness: **False**.
