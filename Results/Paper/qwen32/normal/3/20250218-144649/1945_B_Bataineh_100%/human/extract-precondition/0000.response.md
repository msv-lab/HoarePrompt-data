Precondition: **Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18), where a and b are the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and m is the time each firework is visible in the sky. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
