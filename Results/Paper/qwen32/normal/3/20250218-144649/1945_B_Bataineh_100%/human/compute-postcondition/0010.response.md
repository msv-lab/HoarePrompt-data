To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 + m // a)` statement, let's break down the given information:

- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers with the following constraints:
  - `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18).
  - `b` is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 10^18).
  - `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^18).
  - `m` is less than `b` and `m` is greater than `a`.

Given these constraints, the expression `2 + m // a` involves the integer division `m // a`. The integer division `m // a` will yield the largest integer `k` such that `k * a <= m`.

Let's denote `m // a` as `k`. Therefore, the expression `2 + m // a` simplifies to `2 + k`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `a` and `m`.

Output: **2 + m // a (where m // a is the integer division of m by a)**
