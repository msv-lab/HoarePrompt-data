The `break` statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, none of the variables listed in the initial state will be changed by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is the value causing the cycle detection, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected and must have at least 1 element, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]` up to the value causing the cycle detection, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. Additionally, `k` is less than `i + 1`.**
