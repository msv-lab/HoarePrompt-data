You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the output is either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `resb` and `ress`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists `p` and `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible score for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`, the list `p` which determines the next position to move to, and the list `a` which contains the scores at each position. The function then prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal. This is done up to `k` moves for each player.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by simulating the game for both players, Bodya and Sasha, and calculating their scores after `k` turns. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the program’s logic and correctness:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` (length of the permutation, number of turns, Bodya's starting position, and Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - For both Bodya and Sasha, the program calculates the path they will follow based on the permutation `p` until they encounter a cycle (i.e., a repeated position).
   - It uses a `vis` (visited) array to track positions that have already been visited to detect cycles.
   - The scores for each move are stored in `pathb` and `paths` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each player, the program calculates the maximum possible score they can achieve in `k` turns.
   - It iterates through the path and calculates the score for staying at the current position for the remaining turns.
   - The maximum score is updated accordingly.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the scores for both players, the program compares them and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on who has the higher score or if they are equal.

### Correctness:

- **Cycle Detection:** The program correctly identifies cycles in the permutation, which is crucial for simulating the game accurately.
- **Score Calculation:** The score calculation logic is correct. It considers the score for staying at the current position for the remaining turns, which is the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is greater than the length of the path before encountering a cycle by breaking the loop early.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic for score calculation. The program calculates the score for staying at the current position for the remaining turns, but it does not account for the possibility of moving to another position within the cycle that could yield a higher score. This could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:

Despite the overall correctness of the logic, the program does not account for all possible optimal moves within cycles, which could lead to incorrect results in some edge cases. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
