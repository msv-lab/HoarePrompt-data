In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it is designed to execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered. Since there are no conditions in the loop head to check, the state does not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time. The loop will continue to execute as long as no `break` statement is encountered within the loop body.

Given that the loop is `while True`, the state at the end of the previous iteration can be repeated as is.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the loop to terminate (i.e., `vis[pb - 1]` is 1), `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `paths` is a list containing the single element `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `vis[ps - 1]` is 1.**
