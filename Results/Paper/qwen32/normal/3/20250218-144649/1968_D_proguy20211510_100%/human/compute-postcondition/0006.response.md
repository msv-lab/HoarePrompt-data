The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `p`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
