The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is used to iterate over the range of `int(input())`. This means that the only state we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is the value that `int(input())` will return. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. Given the problem statement, `t` is already defined as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, `int(input())` should return `t` to ensure the loop executes `t` times.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `int(input())` returns `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `int(input())` returns `t`**
