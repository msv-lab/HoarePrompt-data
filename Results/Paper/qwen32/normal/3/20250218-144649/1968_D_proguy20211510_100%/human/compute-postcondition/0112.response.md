In the provided task, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, to ensure that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we do not need to adjust any of the states. The loop will simply repeat the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the element at index `pb - 1` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. Additionally, `resb` is the greater of the two values `resb` and `ress`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
