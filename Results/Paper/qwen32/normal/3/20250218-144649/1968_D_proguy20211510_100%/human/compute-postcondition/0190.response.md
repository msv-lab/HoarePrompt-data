The provided initial state describes a complex set of variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or objects described in the initial state, the output is not dependent on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, or `i`.

Here is the explanation and the output:

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('Draw')
```

This statement will output the string `'Draw'` as it is, without any modification or dependency on the other variables.

Output: **Draw**
