The code snippet provided is `preb += pathb[i]`. This line adds the value of `pathb[i]` to `preb`.

Given the initial state:
- `preb` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `pathb` is a list that contains at least one element from `a`.

After executing `preb += pathb[i]`, the value of `preb` will be updated to `pathb[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list that contains at least one element from `a`, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1, `preb` is `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 0, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `curr` is `pathb[0] * k`.**
