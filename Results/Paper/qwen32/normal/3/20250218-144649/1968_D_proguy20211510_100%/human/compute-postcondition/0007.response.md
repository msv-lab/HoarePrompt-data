The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list of integers to the variable `a`. The initial state does not provide any specific information about the input, so we will assume that the input is a space-separated string of integers.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

In natural language: The variable `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the input, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, and `p`) retain their initial values.
