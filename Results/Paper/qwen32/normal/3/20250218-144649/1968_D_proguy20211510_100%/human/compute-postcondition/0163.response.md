To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to summarize the changes made to the variables in each iteration and extend this pattern to the end of the loop.

The loop iterates over `pathb`, and for each iteration `i`:
- `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`.
- `resb` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr`.
- `preb` is incremented by `pathb[i]`.
- The loop breaks if `k < i + 1`.

Let's formalize this:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `resb = 0`
   - `preb = 0`
   - `i` starts from `min(k, len(paths))`.

2. **Iteration `i`**:
   - `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`
   - `resb = max(resb, curr)`
   - `preb += pathb[i]`
   - The loop breaks if `k < i + 1`.

The loop will run until `i` reaches `len(pathb)` or `k < i + 1`.

### Final Output State Calculation

- **`preb`**: This accumulates the sum of the first `len(pathb)` elements of `pathb`.
- **`resb`**: This keeps track of the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop.
- **`i`**: This will be `min(k, len(pathb))` at the start and will increment until the loop breaks.

The final values of `preb` and `resb` can be calculated as follows:

- `preb` will be the sum of the elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates.
- `resb` will be the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` across all iterations.

### Output State

If the loop runs for all `len(pathb)` iterations (i.e., `k >= len(pathb)`), then:
- `preb = sum(pathb)`
- `resb = max(preb + pathb[i] * (k - i) for i in range(len(pathb)))`

If the loop breaks before `len(pathb)` iterations (i.e., `k < len(pathb)`), then:
- `preb = sum(pathb[:k])`
- `resb = max(preb + pathb[i] * (k - i) for i in range(k))`

Given the pattern, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is the value causing the cycle detection, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]` up to the value causing the cycle detection, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates, `pres` is 0, and `i` is the number of completed iterations of the loop.**

In simpler terms, `resb` will hold the maximum value of the expression `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` across all iterations, `preb` will be the sum of elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates, and `i` will be the number of iterations completed before the loop breaks.
