The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `ans` and `cnt`, but it does specify the constraints for `t`, `n`, and `i`.

Since the values of `ans` and `cnt` are not provided, we can only describe the relationship between them after the operation. The variable `ans` will be updated to the smaller of its current value and `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
