The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` compares the current value of `ans` with the value of `cnt` and assigns the smaller of the two to `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially set to the input integer `n`, and `cnt` is 0. Since 0 is less than any positive integer `n`, `ans` will be updated to 0.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the `i`-th element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**
