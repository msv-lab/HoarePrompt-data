The code snippet provided updates the set `aa` to contain unique integers from the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the newly input integer; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`; `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop; `ans` is the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`.**
