Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- An array is called "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).
- You need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. If it is impossible to do so, return -1.

### Provided Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        tmp = a[0]
        aa = set(a)
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        cnt = 0
        ans = n
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        print(ans)
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Handling of Different Elements:**
   - The code checks if all elements are the same using `len(aa) == 1`. If true, it prints `-1` because such an array cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - The code then iterates through the array and counts consecutive elements equal to the first element `tmp`. It keeps track of the minimum count of such consecutive elements.

2. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The code assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the shortest segment of consecutive elements equal to the first element. This is incorrect.
   - The problem requires checking all possible segments and ensuring that removing the minimum number of elements results in an array that cannot be made uniform using the given operation.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
- According to the code, it will find the shortest segment of consecutive `1`s or `2`s, which is `1` (in this case, the first `1`).
- The code will output `1`, suggesting that removing one element (e.g., the first `1`) will make the array non-beautiful.
- However, removing any single `1` or `2` will still allow the remaining array to be made uniform using the given operation:
  - Removing the first `1` results in `[2, 1, 2, 1]`. You can then replace the middle `2` with `1` to get `[2, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - Removing any `2` results in an array that can be made uniform similarly.

### Correct Output:
For the input `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the correct output should be `2` because you need to remove at least two elements to prevent the array from being made uniform (e.g., removing two `2`s).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove in all cases. It fails to consider all possible segments and their removal impacts correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
