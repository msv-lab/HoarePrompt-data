The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` could either be 2 or 0. After the increment, if `cnt` was initially 2, it becomes 3. If `cnt` was initially 0, it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than `t`, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`, `i` is `t + 1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is the newly input integer `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is either 0 or 1.**
