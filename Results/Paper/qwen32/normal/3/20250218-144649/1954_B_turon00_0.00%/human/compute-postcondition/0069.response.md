The code snippet assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the newly input integer; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is the newly input integer `n`.**
