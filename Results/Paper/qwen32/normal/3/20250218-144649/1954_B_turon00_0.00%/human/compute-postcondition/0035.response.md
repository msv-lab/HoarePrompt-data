The code snippet `aa = set(a)` converts the list `a` into a set `aa`, which removes any duplicate elements from `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `tmp` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`.**
