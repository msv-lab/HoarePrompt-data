The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged, except that now `tmp` holds the value of `a[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is `a[0]`.**
