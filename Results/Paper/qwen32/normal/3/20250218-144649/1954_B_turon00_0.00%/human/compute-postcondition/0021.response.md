The value of `cnt` is reset to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and relationships.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`; `cnt` is 0.**
