Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(A + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Inputs**: `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers. Their exact values are not provided, so we'll describe the output in terms of these variables.
2. **Calculating `A`**: 
   - `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`. This means `A` is the integer division of `m` by `a` plus one.
3. **Calculating `B`**: 
   - `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`. This means `B` is the integer division of `m` by `b` plus one.
4. **Summing `A` and `B`**:
   - The `print` statement outputs the sum of `A` and `B`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the sum of `A` and `B`, where `A` is `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.

Output: **(int(m / a) + 1) + (int(m / b) + 1) (where A = int(m / a) + 1 and B = int(m / b) + 1)**

To make it more readable:
Output: **int(m / a) + int(m / b) + 2**
