The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `B` using the expression `int(m / b) + 1`. Since `B` was already defined in the initial state with the same expression, reassigning it does not change its value. Therefore, the state remains the same with respect to `B`. The other variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the three integers read from the input; `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.**
