Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic used in the program (simply adding the number of fireworks from each installation) does not account for overlaps in the visibility times of fireworks from both installations.

To solve the problem, one needs to consider the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the two frequencies `a` and `b` to determine the periodic pattern of overlapping fireworks. The solution should calculate how many fireworks from each installation are visible within one LCM period and then account for overlaps correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        # Number of fireworks from each installation within one LCM period
        A = (lcm_ab // a) + (m // a)
        B = (lcm_ab // b) + (m // b)
        
        # Overlapping fireworks within one LCM period
        overlap = (lcm_ab // (a * b // math.gcd(a, b))) + (m // (a * b // math.gcd(a, b)))
        
        # Maximum fireworks visible at the same time
        max_fireworks = A + B - overlap
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by considering the overlaps between the two installations' firing patterns.
