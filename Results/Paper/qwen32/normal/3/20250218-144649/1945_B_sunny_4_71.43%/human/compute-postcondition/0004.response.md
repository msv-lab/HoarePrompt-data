The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `B` based on the integer division of `m` by `b` and then adds 1 to the result. The other variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the three integers read from the input; `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.**
