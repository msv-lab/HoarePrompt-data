The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. This overwrites the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, but the initial values of `t`, `A`, and `B` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the three integers read from the input; `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains 1, while `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the three integers read from the input. The values of `A` and `B` remain as `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1`, respectively, based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
