Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Firework Launching Intervals:**
   - The first installation launches fireworks every `a` minutes.
   - The second installation launches fireworks every `b` minutes.
   
2. **Visibility of Fireworks:**
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.
   - If a firework is launched at time `x`, it will be visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.

3. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

### Key Observations:

- For a given time `x`, the number of fireworks from the first installation visible at `x` is the number of multiples of `a` within the range `[x - m, x]`.
- Similarly, the number of fireworks from the second installation visible at `x` is the number of multiples of `b` within the range `[x - m, x]`.
- The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously would be the maximum sum of these two counts over all possible times `x`.

### Mistake in the Provided Program:

The provided program calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`, and then outputs `A + B`. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the overlap in visibility times across different launches.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks for any given time `x`. This involves:
- Counting the multiples of `a` and `b` within the interval `[x - m, x]`.
- The correct formula for the count of multiples of `a` in the interval `[x - m, x]` is `floor(x / a) - floor((x - m - 1) / a)`.
- Similarly, for multiples of `b`, it is `floor(x / b) - floor((x - m - 1) / b)`.

The maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is the maximum of the sum of these two counts over all possible times `x`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks. It simply adds the number of fireworks that could be launched within the visibility period by each installation, which does not account for the overlap and simultaneous visibility.

Thus, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
