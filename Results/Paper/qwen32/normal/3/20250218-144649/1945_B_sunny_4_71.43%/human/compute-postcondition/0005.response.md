To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
   - `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

2. **Calculating `A` and `B`:**
   - `A` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, plus 1.
   - `B` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, plus 1.

3. **Output Statement:**
   - The `print` statement outputs the sum of `A` and `B`.

Let's describe the values of `A` and `B` in terms of the given variables:

- `A` is the result of `int(m / a) + 1`, which means it is the integer part of `m` divided by `a`, plus 1.
- `B` is the result of `int(m / b) + 1`, which means it is the integer part of `m` divided by `b`, plus 1.

The final output will be the sum of these two values.

Output: **(int(m / a) + 1) + (int(m / b) + 1) (where A = int(m / a) + 1 and B = int(m / b) + 1)**

Simplifying the expression inside the output:

Output: **int(m / a) + int(m / b) + 2 (where A = int(m / a) + 1 and B = int(m / b) + 1)**
