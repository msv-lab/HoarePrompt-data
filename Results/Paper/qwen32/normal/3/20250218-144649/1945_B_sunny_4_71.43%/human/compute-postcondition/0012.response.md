The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. This means that the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be overwritten by the new values read from the input. However, the variables `t`, `A`, and `B` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the three integers read from the input; `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.**

In simpler terms, `t` remains 1, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the new values read from the input. The values of `A` and `B` remain based on the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `m` before the input was read.
