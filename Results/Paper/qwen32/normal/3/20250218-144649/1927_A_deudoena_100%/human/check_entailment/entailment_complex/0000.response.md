Reasoning:
The program provided does not correctly determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. The function `func_1()` calculates the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B' in the string and adds 2 to this difference. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum segment length that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.

For example, consider the test case "WBBWBW". The first 'B' is at position 2 and the last 'B' is at position 5. The function would return 5 - 2 + 2 = 5, but the correct answer is 4, as painting positions 2 to 5 (inclusive) would turn the strip white.

A correct approach would be to find the longest continuous segment of 'B's in the string, as painting this segment white would ensure that all 'B's are turned white with the minimum segment length. If there are multiple segments of 'B's, the one with the maximum length should be chosen.

Correctness: **False**
