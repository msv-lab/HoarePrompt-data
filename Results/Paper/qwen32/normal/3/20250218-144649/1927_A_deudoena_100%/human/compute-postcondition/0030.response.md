The code snippet provided updates the value of `ma` to be `len(s) - d`. Given that `s` is a string of length `n` and `d` is 2, the new value of `ma` will be `n - 2`.

Here is the updated state of the variables after executing the code snippet:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present, `ma` is `n - 2`, `mi` is `k` if the first 'B' is at position `k`, `m` is an input integer, `c` is `k`, `d` is 2, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`.**

In simpler terms, the length of the string `s` minus 2 is now assigned to `ma`, while all other variables retain their initial values or states.
