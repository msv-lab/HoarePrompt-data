The code snippet provided increments the value of the variable `d` by 1. No other variables are affected or changed by this code.

Given the initial state, the value of `d` was 1. After executing `d += 1`, the value of `d` becomes 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present, `ma` is `n - 1` if `j` is 'B', otherwise it remains 0, `mi` is `k` if the first 'B' is at position `k`, `m` is an input integer, `c` is `k`, `d` is 2, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`**.
