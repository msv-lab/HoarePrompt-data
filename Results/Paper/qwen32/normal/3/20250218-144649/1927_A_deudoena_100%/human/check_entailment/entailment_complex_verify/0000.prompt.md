You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present.

    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a new input string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is 0; `mi` is k if the first 'B' is at position k; `m` is an input integer; `c` is k; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in the original string `s`; `mi` is k if the first 'B' is at position k; `m` is an input integer; `c` is k; `d` is the number of characters processed until the first 'B' is encountered in the reversed string; `l` is an empty list; `j` is 'B'.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' (ma) and the position of the first 'B' (mi) in the string `s`, plus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B' in a given string `s`, plus 2. The string `s` consists of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in order for all n cells to become white. The logic in the `func_1` function does not account for the correct minimum segment length that covers all black cells.

Let's analyze the code:
1. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the minimum length of a segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.
2. The code finds the first occurrence of a black cell (`mi`) and the last occurrence of a black cell (`ma`).
3. It then returns `ma - mi + 2` as the minimum segment length.

However, this logic is incorrect because the segment should cover all black cells, not just the first and last occurrence. The correct approach would be to find the segment that spans from the first black cell to the last black cell, which is `ma - mi + 1`.

Let's consider a counterexample:
- Input: `n = 1`, `s = "B"`
  - The current code will return `ma - mi + 2 = 1 - 1 + 2 = 2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because the entire segment of length 1 needs to be painted.

- Input: `n = 3`, `s = "BBW"`
  - The current code will return `ma - mi + 2 = 2 - 1 + 2 = 3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because the segment from the 1st to the 2nd cell needs to be painted.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
