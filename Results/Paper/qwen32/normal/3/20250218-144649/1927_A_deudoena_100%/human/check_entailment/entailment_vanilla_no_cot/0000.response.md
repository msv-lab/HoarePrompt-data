Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. 

The logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect. The function attempts to find the first and last black cells and then calculates the distance between them, adding 2. However, this approach does not account for the possibility that there might be multiple segments of black cells that need to be considered, and it does not handle all edge cases correctly.

For example, in the test case `WBBWBW`, the program would identify the first black cell at position 2 and the last black cell at position 5, and then return `5 - 2 + 2 = 5`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 4, as painting the segment from the 2nd to the 5th cell would make the entire strip white.

A correct approach would involve finding the longest contiguous segment of black cells, as painting this segment would ensure that all black cells are turned white.
