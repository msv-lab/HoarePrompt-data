Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a new input string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is `n - 1`; `mi` is k if the first 'B' is at position k; `m` is an input integer; `c` is k; `d` is 1; `l` is an empty list; `j` is 'B'**

Explanation: The value of `ma` is updated to `len(s) - d`. Since `s` is a string of length `n` and `d` is 1, `ma` becomes `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
