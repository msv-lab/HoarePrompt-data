Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and the given function summary to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white in order for all cells in a strip to become white. The strip is represented by a string of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters, with at least one 'B' present.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1()` `n` times. The function `func_1()` reads the length of the strip `m` and the string `s` for each test case.

Here's the function `func_1()`:
```python
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2
```

### Function Summary:
The function calculates and returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B' in a given string `s`, plus 2. The string `s` consists of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present.

### Issues in the Logic:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `ma - mi + 2` to determine the minimum segment length.
   - The `+2` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` to get the length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B'.

2. **Function Call and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` does not take any parameters, but it reads the input for `m` and `s` directly. This is acceptable as long as the function is called in a context where the input is correctly provided, but it deviates from a typical function design where inputs are passed as parameters.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the logic, the program does not correctly determine the minimum segment length for all test cases. The formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect, and it should be `ma - mi + 1`.

### Correctness: **False**

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    mi = s.find('B')  # Find the first occurrence of 'B'
    ma = s.rfind('B')  # Find the last occurrence of 'B'
    print(ma - mi + 1)  # Correct formula for the minimum segment length
```

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
