Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a new input string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 2 if the current character `j` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0; `m` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list; `j` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `j`.**
