The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which iterates over the reversed string `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `j` and how it changes as the loop progresses.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10
- `s` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present
- `ma` is `n - 1` if `j` is 'B', otherwise it remains 0
- `mi` is `k` if the first 'B' is at position `k`
- `m` is an input integer
- `c` is `k`
- `d` is 1
- `l` is an empty list
- If `j` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

The loop iterates over the reversed string `s[::-1]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been the character that was processed. To start the next iteration, `j` should be the next character in the reversed string.

Let's denote the current character `j` at the end of the previous iteration as `s[::-1][i]`. For the next iteration, `j` should be `s[::-1][i+1]`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` (the index in the reversed string) from the given state, we can only describe the state in terms of the next character in the reversed string. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present, `ma` is `n - 1` if `j` is 'B', otherwise it remains 0, `mi` is `k` if the first 'B' is at position `k`, `m` is an input integer, `c` is `k`, `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`**
