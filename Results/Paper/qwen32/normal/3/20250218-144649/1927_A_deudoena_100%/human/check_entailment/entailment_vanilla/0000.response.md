Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white in order for all cells in a strip to become white. The strip is represented by a string of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters.

### Program Analysis:
The given program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called `n` times in a loop, but it does not take any parameters. Inside `func_1()`, it reads the input for `m` and `s` again, which means it is responsible for reading the input for each test case.

2. **Logic of Minimum Segment**:
   - The program tries to find the first occurrence of 'B' (`mi`) and the last occurrence of 'B' (`ma`) in the string.
   - It then calculates the minimum segment length as `ma - mi + 2`.

### Issues in the Logic:
- The calculation of `ma - mi + 2` does not correctly determine the minimum segment length that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. The correct approach should be to consider the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B' because painting this segment will turn all 'B's to 'W's.
- The `+2` in the formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` to get the length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B'.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the logic, the program does not correctly determine the minimum segment length for all test cases.

### Correctness: **False**

To correct the program, the formula should be adjusted to `ma - mi + 1` and the function should be properly structured to handle each test case correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    mi = s.find('B')
    ma = s.rfind('B')
    print(ma - mi + 1)
```

This corrected program should work as expected for all valid inputs.
