The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 5, and `t` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 5; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the new list `l`; `m` is the length of the new list `l`; If the integer 1 is in the new list `l`, then the list `l` includes the integer 1. Otherwise, the number 1 is not in the list `l`; `i` is 5.**
