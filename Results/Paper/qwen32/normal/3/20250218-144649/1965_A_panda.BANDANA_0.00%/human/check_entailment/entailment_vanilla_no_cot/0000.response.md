Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The program only checks if there is a pile with exactly one stone and incorrectly concludes that Bob wins in that case, and Alice wins otherwise. The correct strategy involves analyzing the game using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero at the start, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for num in l:
            nim_sum ^= num
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This program calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
