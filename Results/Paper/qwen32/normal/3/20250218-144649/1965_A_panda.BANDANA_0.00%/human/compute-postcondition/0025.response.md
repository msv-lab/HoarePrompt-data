The given `print` statement is `print('Alice')`. This statement will print the string "Alice" regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `e`, `m`, and `i` as defined in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `e`, `m`, `i`) and their relationships but does not affect the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string "Alice".

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string "Alice".

Output: **Alice**
