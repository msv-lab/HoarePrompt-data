Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with `n` (length of `s`) being at least 2, `j` must be less than `n`. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. The current value of `count` is equal to `j`.**
