Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with `n` (length of `s`) being at least 2, `j` must be less than `n`, `k` is `k + 1` and `k + 1` must be less than `n - j`. If `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]`, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.**
