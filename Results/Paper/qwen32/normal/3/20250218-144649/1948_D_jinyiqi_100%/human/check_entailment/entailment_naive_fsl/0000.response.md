Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the code does not replace question marks with lowercase Latin letters to maximize the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat. Instead, it simply checks for existing potential tandem repeats without modifying the string to replace question marks.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
a?ba?
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
By replacing the question marks with 'a', the string becomes "aabaaa", which contains a tandem repeat "aaaa" of length 4.

**Actual Output of the Provided Code:**
```
0
```

The code does not attempt to replace question marks and thus fails to find the correct maximum length of a tandem repeat. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
