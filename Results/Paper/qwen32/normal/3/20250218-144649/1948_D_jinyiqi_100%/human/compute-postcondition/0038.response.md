To determine what will be printed by the `print(count * 2)` statement, we need to focus on the value of the variable `count` as described in the initial state.

From the initial state:
- `count` is explicitly given as 2.

The statement `print(count * 2)` multiplies the value of `count` by 2. Since `count` is 2, the expression `count * 2` evaluates to `2 * 2`, which is 4.

Thus, the print statement will output the value 4.

Output: **4**
