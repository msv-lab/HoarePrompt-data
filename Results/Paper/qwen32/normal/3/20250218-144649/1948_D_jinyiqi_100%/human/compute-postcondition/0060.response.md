Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `count` is 1, `k` is `n - 3`, and either `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.**

The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `j`, `n`, `k`, and the conditions involving `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` remain unchanged.
