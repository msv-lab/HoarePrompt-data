The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The values of `j`, `n`, and the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `count` is 1, and the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` is true.
Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `count` is 1, and the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` is true.**
