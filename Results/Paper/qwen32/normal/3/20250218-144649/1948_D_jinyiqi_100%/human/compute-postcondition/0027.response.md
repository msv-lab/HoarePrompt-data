Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with `n` (length of `s`) being at least 2, `j` must be less than `n`, `k` is `k + 1`. If `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]`, then `count` is either equal to `j + 1` or less than `j + 1` if it was incremented by 1, or `count` is 1 if it was set to 0. Otherwise, `count` is 0. The program returns nothing (None) if `count` is equal to `j`.**
