Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem by determining the final MEX score of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The program reads the number of test cases, the size of the array `n`, and the elements of the array `a` for each test case. It then calculates the frequency of each element in the array using a dictionary `cnt`.

The logic of the program is to iterate through the possible values from 0 to `n` and check the frequency of each value in the array. The variable `t` counts the number of elements that appear exactly once in the array. The function returns the first value `i` for which either `t` is at least 2 (indicating that there are at least two distinct elements that appear exactly once) or the frequency of `i` in the array is 0 (indicating that `i` is not present in the array).

This logic is based on the observation that Alice and Bob will play in such a way that the MEX of `c` is maximized by Alice and minimized by Bob. Since Alice goes first, she can strategically choose elements to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to counter her by minimizing it. However, the optimal strategy leads to the result that the MEX is determined by the first value that is either not present in the array or appears exactly once, as this will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` after all elements have been chosen and deleted.

The provided program correctly implements this logic and should produce the correct output for each test case as described in the problem statement and the example.

Correctness: **True**
