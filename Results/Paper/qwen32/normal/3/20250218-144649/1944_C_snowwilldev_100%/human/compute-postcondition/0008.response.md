The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the dictionary `cnt` by 1. Given that `i` is 2, the element `a[2]` is targeted for this increment.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the count of `a[2]` in the dictionary `cnt` has been increased by 1, while the count of `a[1]` remains incremented by 1 as per the initial state.
