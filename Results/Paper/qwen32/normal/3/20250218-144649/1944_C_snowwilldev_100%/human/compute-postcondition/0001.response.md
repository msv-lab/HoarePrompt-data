The given code snippet reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. This line of input represents the elements of an array `a`. The initial state mentions that `n` is the size of the array `a` and that the array `a` itself has not been defined yet. After executing the code, the array `a` will be defined with the values from the input.

Output State: **N is an input integer, the input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
