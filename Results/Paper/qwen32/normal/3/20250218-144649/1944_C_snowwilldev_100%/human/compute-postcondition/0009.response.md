Output State: **`N` iterations have completed, `i` is `N-1`, `cnt` contains the frequency of each element in the array `a`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all `N` iterations, the loop variable `i` will have reached `N-1`, which is the last index of the array `a`. The `cnt` dictionary will have been updated to reflect the frequency of each element in the array `a`. Each element `a[i]` in the array `a` will have its count incremented by 1 in the `cnt` dictionary, representing how many times each element appears in the array.
