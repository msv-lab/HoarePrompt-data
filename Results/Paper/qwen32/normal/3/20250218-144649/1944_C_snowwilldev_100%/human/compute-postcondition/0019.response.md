The value of `t` is incremented by 1. Given that `t` was either 0 or 1, after the operation `t += 1`, `t` will be either 1 or 2. However, the precondition states that `t` is less than 2, which means `t` must have been 0 before the increment. Therefore, after the increment, `t` will be 1. 

The values of `N`, `i`, `cnt`, and the frequency of the element at index `i` in `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `cnt` contains the frequency of each element in the array `a`, the frequency of the element at index `i` in `cnt` is not 0, and `t` is 1.**
