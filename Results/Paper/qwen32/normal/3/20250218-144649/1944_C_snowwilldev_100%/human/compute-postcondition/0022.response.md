Postcondition: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `cnt` contains the frequency of each element in the array `a`, the frequency of the element at index `i` in `cnt` is not 0, and `t` is 1. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or the frequency of the element at index `i` in `cnt` is 0, the program returns 1. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues execution.**
