The code snippet provided updates the value of `minn` based on the minimum between its current value and the value of `same`. 

Given the initial state, `minn` is either `inf` or `1` depending on whether `ar[i-1]` equals `num`. The value of `same` is either `1` or `2` based on the same condition. 

The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of itself and `same`. Therefore, if `minn` was `inf`, it will be updated to `same` (which is either `1` or `2`). If `minn` was `1`, it will remain `1` if `same` is `1` or `2`, as `min(1, 1)` and `min(1, 2)` both result in `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 1` elements; `i` is `i + 2`; `same` is 2 if `ar[i-1]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[0]`), otherwise `same` is 1 and `num` is updated to `ar[2]`; `minn` is `1` if `ar[i-1]` equals `num` or `same` was `1`, otherwise `minn` is `2`; `num` is `ar[i]`.**
