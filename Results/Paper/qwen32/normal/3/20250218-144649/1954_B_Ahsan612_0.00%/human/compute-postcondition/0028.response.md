The code snippet assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Given the initial conditions, if `i` is 5, then `num` will be equal to `ar[5]`. However, if `i` is 6, then `num` will be equal to `ar[6]`.

Given the initial state, `i` is 5 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num` and `same` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 6 and `same` is 1. Since the code snippet assigns `ar[i]` to `num`, the value of `num` will be `ar[5]` if `same` is 3, and `ar[6]` if `same` is 1.

Since the value of `i` is determined by the condition involving `same`, and the code snippet assigns `ar[i]` to `num`, we can deduce the following:

- If `same` is 3, `num` will be `ar[5]`.
- If `same` is 1, `num` will be `ar[6]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `minn`, `i`, `same`) remain unchanged except for `num`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `minn` is 1, `i` is 5 if `same` is 3 else `i` is 6, `same` is 3 if `i` is 5 else `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[5]` if `same` is 3 else `num` is `ar[6]`.**
