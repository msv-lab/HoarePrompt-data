Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is 1
- `num` is 1
- `minn` is 1
- `i` is 6
- `minn` is not equal to infinity

The `print(minn)` statement will print the value of the variable `minn`.

From the initial state, we know that `minn` is explicitly set to 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1**
