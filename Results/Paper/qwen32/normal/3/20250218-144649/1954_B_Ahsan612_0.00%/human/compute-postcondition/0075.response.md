Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive numbers in `ar`; `num` is the last unique number encountered in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, and `minn` is currently equal to `inf`; `i` is `len(ar)`**
