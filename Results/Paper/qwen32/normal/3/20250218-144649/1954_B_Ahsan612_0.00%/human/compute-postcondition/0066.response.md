The code snippet increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `same` is either 2 or 1, depending on whether `ar[i] == num`. After the operation `same += 1`, the new value of `same` will be either 3 or 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and has more than 3 elements; `minn` is 1; `i` is 4 if `ar[i] == num` and 5 otherwise; `same` is 3 if `ar[i] == num` and 2 otherwise; `num` is `ar[2]` if `ar[i] == num` and `ar[4]` otherwise.**
