Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4 and `same` is 4. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 6, `same` is 1, and `num` is `ar[6]`.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes to the variables `i` and `same` based on whether `ar[i]` is equal to `num`. It also retains the conditions stated in the precondition for `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `minn`.
