The code snippet provided resets the variable `same` to 1. This change does not affect the values of other variables such as `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, or `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is 1; `num` is the last number in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`; `i` is equal to the length of the new `ar`.**
