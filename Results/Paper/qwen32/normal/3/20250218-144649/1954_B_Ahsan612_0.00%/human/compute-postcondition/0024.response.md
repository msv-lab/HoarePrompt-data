The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was either 3 or 4, it will now be 4 or 5, respectively. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4 and `same` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 5 and `same` is 1.**
