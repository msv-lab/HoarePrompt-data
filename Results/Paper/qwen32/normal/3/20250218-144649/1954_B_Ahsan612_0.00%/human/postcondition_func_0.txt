The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `a`. If no such occurrence is found (which theoretically shouldn't happen given the problem constraints), it prints `-1`.
