Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues and does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some specific cases where the program fails:

1. **Edge Case with Single Element:**
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     1
     1
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     -1
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     1
     ```
   - Explanation: The program incorrectly outputs `1` for a single-element array. Since a single-element array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, the correct output should be `-1`.

2. **Case with Alternating Elements:**
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     4
     1 2 1 2
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     1
     ```
   - Explanation: The program incorrectly outputs `1` for an array with alternating elements. To make the array non-beautiful, at least two elements need to be removed (e.g., removing the second and fourth elements results in `[1, 1]`, which is not beautiful).

3. **Case with Multiple Segments:**
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     6
     1 1 2 2 1 1
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     2
     ```
   - Explanation: This case seems to work correctly, but it is not sufficient to prove the correctness of the program. The previous cases already show that the program is incorrect.

The core issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. The program seems to only consider contiguous segments of the same number and does not account for the possibility of multiple segments or the need to remove more than one element in some cases.

To fix the program, a more comprehensive approach would be needed, such as using dynamic programming or a different strategy to count and handle the segments of the array correctly.
