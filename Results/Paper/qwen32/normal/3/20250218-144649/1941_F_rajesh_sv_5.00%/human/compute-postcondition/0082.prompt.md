Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` is the index in `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `h` is the index in `D` just before where `right - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `l` equals `h`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` and `h` are indices in `D` that define the range where `left - f` and `right - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, and `left - f` is less than `right - f`. `mid` is the index calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `h` is at least `l + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `h` is at least `l + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
