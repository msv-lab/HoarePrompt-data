The code assigns the value of `diff` to `max_diff`. Given that `diff` is calculated as `A[4] - A[3]`, `max_diff` will also hold this value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `i` is 4, `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`, `max_diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`.**
