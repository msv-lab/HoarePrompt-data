The function accepts a tuple `args` containing any number of arguments. It returns the value associated with the key `args` in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not already a key in `d`, it computes the value by calling `func(*args)`, stores this value in `d` with `args` as the key, and then returns this value. Otherwise, it returns the pre-existing value associated with `args`.
