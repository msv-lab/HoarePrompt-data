The provided Python code snippet updates the value of `next_max_diff` to the current value of `diff`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state:
- `A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`
- `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`
- `index` is `i` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is `None`
- `max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged
- `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` and `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged
- `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`
- `i` is incremented by 1

After executing the line `next_max_diff = diff`, the value of `next_max_diff` is now equal to `diff`. The other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `index` is `i` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is `None`, `max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` is `diff`, `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**
