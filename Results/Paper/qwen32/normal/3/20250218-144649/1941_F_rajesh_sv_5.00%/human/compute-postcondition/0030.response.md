The given code snippet assigns the values of `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]` to the variables `left` and `right`, respectively. This means that `left` will hold the element in the tuple `A` that is immediately before the element where the maximum difference `max_diff` was found, and `right` will hold the element where `max_diff` was found.

Given the initial state, the values of `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `left` and `right`.

Output State: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `m` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`.**
