Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D` and `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`; `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

This means that the variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` have been updated to the sum of the `mid`-th element and `mid + 1`-th element of the list `D` respectively, each incremented by `f`. All other conditions and variable states from the initial state remain the same.
