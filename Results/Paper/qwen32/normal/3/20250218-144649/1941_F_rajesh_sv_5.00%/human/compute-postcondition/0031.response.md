The code assigns the value of `max_diff` to the variable `ans`. This means that `ans` will now hold the same value as `max_diff`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `m` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`.**
