Postcondition: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, `index` is set to `i` and `max_diff` is updated to `diff`. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` and less than or equal to `max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`. Otherwise, `index` remains `i` if it was already set, or `None` if not, and `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` remain unchanged. `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
