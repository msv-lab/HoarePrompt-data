The code snippet calculates the sum of the element at the `mid` index in list `D` and the variable `f`, and assigns this to `mid_sum`. It also calculates the sum of the element at the `mid + 1` index in list `D` and the variable `f`, and assigns this to `mid_next_sum`.

Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `h` is at least `l + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
