Output State: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `m` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()` and must be a non-empty iterable, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `l` is the position in `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order.**

Natural Language: The variable `l` is introduced and assigned the value of the position in the sorted list `D` where the value `left - f` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
