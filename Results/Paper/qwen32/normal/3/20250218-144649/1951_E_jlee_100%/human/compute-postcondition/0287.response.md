Postcondition: **`done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or if `count` is greater than 1 or if `count2` is greater than `count`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. `i` remains equal to `t`; `string` remains the user's input; `s` remains a list of characters from `string`; `n` remains greater than 0; `x` remains the first character of `string`; `j` is incremented by 1; `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, or if `count` is greater than 1, or if `count2` is greater than `count`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
