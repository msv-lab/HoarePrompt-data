Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. `count2` is now `count2` + 1.**

In simple terms: The value of `count2` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
