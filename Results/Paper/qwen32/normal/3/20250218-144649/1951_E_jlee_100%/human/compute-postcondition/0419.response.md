To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the provided conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is updated to `j + 2`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `done` is set to `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.

To understand what will be printed, we need to break down the slicing operations on `string`.

- `string[:j - 1]` will print the substring from the start of `string` up to, but not including, the character at index `j - 1`.
- `string[j - 1:]` will print the substring from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

Let's denote `string` as `s` (since `string` is not explicitly defined, we assume it's the same as `s` from the conditions).

### Detailed Explanation:
- `j` has been incremented by 2 compared to its initial value.
- `string[:j - 1]` will take all characters from the start of `s` up to the character just before the new `j` position.
- `string[j - 1:]` will take all characters from the new `j` position to the end of `s`.

### Example:
Let's assume the initial value of `j` was `3` and `s` is `"abcdefg"`:
- After `j = j + 2`, `j` becomes `5`.
- `string[:j - 1]` becomes `s[:4]` which is `"abcd"`.
- `string[j - 1:]` becomes `s[4:]` which is `"efg"`.

### General Case:
Without knowing the exact value of `j` and the string `s`, we can generalize the output as follows:
- `string[:j - 1]` will be the substring from the start of `s` up to, but not including, the character at index `j - 1`.
- `string[j - 1:]` will be the substring from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `s`.

Given the information, we can describe the output as:

Output: **string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:] (where string[:j - 1] is the substring from the start of the string up to the character just before the new j position, and string[j - 1:] is the substring from the new j position to the end of the string)**
