The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables directly; it only controls the flow of the loop. Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, no changes occur to the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `done`, `count`, or `count2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False, and `count` and `count2` are 0. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. The current value of `count` is `j` and `count2` is 0.**
