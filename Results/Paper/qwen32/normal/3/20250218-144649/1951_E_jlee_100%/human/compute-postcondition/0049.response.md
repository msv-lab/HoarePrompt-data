The `print('YES')` statement in the provided code snippet will execute and print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `done`, `count2`, `count`, or `x` as long as the code execution reaches this point.

Here's the breakdown of the provided information:
- `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`.
- `string` is the input string.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `done` is a boolean variable that is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` for some index `j`.
- `count2` is initialized to 0.
- The current value of `count` is greater than 0.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is less than `count`.

None of these conditions or variables affect the output of the `print('YES')` statement. The statement will simply output the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
