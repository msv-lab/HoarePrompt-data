Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `j` is defined as `j + 2`. However, this statement does not provide an initial value for `j`. It suggests that `j` is being incremented by 2 but does not specify what `j` was initially.
- `n` is greater than 0. This indicates a condition on `n`, but it does not provide an explicit value for `n`.
- The variable `string` is not defined or mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, its value is unknown.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(string)` statement attempts to print the value of the variable `string`.
- However, `string` is not defined anywhere in the provided initial state or the code snippet. This means that attempting to print `string` will result in a `NameError` because Python will not recognize `string` as a defined variable.

### Conclusion:
Since `string` is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError` when executed. However, based on the task instructions, we should describe the intended output if the variable were defined. Given that it is not defined, we cannot provide a precise value for what will be printed.

### Output:
Output: **NameError: name 'string' is not defined** (This is the error that would be raised, but since we need to adhere to the task format, we describe the intended output based on the given information)

Since the task asks for what will be printed and the variable `string` is not defined, we can only provide a description based on the given information:

Output: **string (where string is a variable that is not defined in the given context)**
