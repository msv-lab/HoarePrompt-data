To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`string`**: This is the new user's input, a string of characters.
2. **`s`**: This is a list of characters from the `string`.
3. **`n`**: This is the length of the string `string` and thus the length of the list `s`.
4. **`x`**: This is the first character of the `string`.
5. **`j`**: This is an index variable used in the loop, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state.
6. **`count`**: This is a counter that is greater than 1, indicating that `s[j]` is not equal to `x` or `count` was already incremented previously.
7. **`count2`**: This is equal to `count`.
8. **`i`**: This is `t + 1`, but `t` is not defined in the initial state.
9. **`done`**: This is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains `False`.

The `print` statement given is:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Explanation:

- `string[:j - 1]`: This part of the print statement slices the `string` from the beginning up to, but not including, the character at index `j - 1`.
- `string[j - 1:]`: This part of the print statement slices the `string` from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.

The exact output will depend on the value of `j`, which is not explicitly given. However, we can describe the output in terms of `j`.

### Output Description:

The `print` statement will output two parts of the `string`:
- The first part is the substring from the start of `string` up to, but not including, the character at index `j - 1`.
- The second part is the substring from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact substrings. However, we can describe the output in terms of `j`.

Output: **string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:] (where j is the index used in the loop)**
