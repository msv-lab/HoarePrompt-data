To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `j` is defined as `j + 2`. This means that `j` is being incremented by 2, but the initial value of `j` is not provided. This operation does not affect the print statement.
- `n` is greater than 0. The exact value of `n` is not provided, but it is known that `n` is positive.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the variables `j` or `n`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of `j` or `n`, the output will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
