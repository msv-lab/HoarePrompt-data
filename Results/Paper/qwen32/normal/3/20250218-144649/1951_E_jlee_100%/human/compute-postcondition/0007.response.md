The `print('NO')` statement in the given code snippet will print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, and `done`) because the print statement explicitly specifies the string to be printed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
3. The variable `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`.
4. The variable `string` is an input string.
5. The variable `n` is the length of the list `s` and is specified to be 1.
6. The variable `done` is a boolean value set to False.

None of these variables influence the output of the `print('NO')` statement. The statement directly outputs the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
