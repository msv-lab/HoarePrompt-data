The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given the initial state, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It will simply skip the remaining part of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged, `count` is `j`**

In simpler terms, the values of `j`, `n`, `done`, and `count` remain the same after the `continue` statement is executed. The loop will move to its next iteration without modifying these variables.
