Output State: **`done` is `True`; `i` remains equal to `t`; `string` remains the user's input; `s` remains a list of characters from `string`; `n` remains greater than 0; `x` remains the first character of `string`; `j` is incremented by 1; `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms: The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `done`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `j` (before it was incremented) remain unchanged, except `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `count` remains as defined by the condition `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`.
