Postcondition: **`done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or if `count2 < count`; otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. `i` remains equal to `t`; `string` remains the user's input; `s` remains a list of characters from `string`; `n` remains greater than 0; `x` remains the first character of `string`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j`. If `count2` equals `count`, `count2` is 0 if `count <= 1`; otherwise, `count2` remains unchanged. `j` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
