Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `done` is True.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that the variable `done` is set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
