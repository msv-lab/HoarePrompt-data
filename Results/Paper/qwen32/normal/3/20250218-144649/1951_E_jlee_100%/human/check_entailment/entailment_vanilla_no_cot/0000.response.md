Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and logic for partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Single Character Strings**: The code correctly identifies that single-character strings cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and outputs "NO".

2. **Strings with All Identical Characters**: The code correctly identifies that strings with all identical characters cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and outputs "NO".

3. **Strings with Two Different Characters**: The code attempts to handle strings with two different characters but fails to correctly identify and partition such strings. For example, the string "lllllllll" is correctly identified as "NO", but the logic for handling strings like "uwuowouwu" can be incorrect. The program might not always find a valid partition when one exists.

4. **General Case Handling**: The logic for handling general cases is flawed. The program attempts to find a valid partition by checking if the string is a palindrome and then trying to split it into two parts. However, it does not always correctly identify when a valid partition exists, especially for longer strings with more complex patterns.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to find a valid partition
        found_partition = False
        for j in range(1, n):
            part1 = string[:j]
            part2 = string[j:]
            if not is_palindrome(part1) and not is_palindrome(part2):
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(part1, part2)
                found_partition = True
                break
        
        if not found_partition:
            # If no valid partition found, check if the whole string is a palindrome
            if not is_palindrome(string):
                print('YES')
                print(1)
                print(string)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version checks for valid partitions by trying to split the string into two parts and verifying that both parts are non-palindromic. If no such partition is found, it checks if the entire string is non-palindromic. If the entire string is palindromic and no valid partition can be found, it outputs "NO".
