Postcondition: **The loop has completed all `n` iterations without setting `done` to `True`. `done` remains `False`, `count` and `count2` reflect the final state of the character checks. `i` is equal to `t`. `string` is the user's input. `s` is a list of characters from `string`. `n` is equal to the length of the list `s`. `x` is the first character of `string`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, the condition is met as described.**
