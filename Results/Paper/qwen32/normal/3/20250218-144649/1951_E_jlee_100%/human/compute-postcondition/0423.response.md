Output State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged, `count` is set to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the state remains the same as the initial state.
