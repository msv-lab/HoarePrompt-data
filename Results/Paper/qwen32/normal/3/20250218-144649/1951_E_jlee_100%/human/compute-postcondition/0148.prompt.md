Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, and `done` is False. If `s.count(x) == n`, then all characters in `s` are the same and equal to `x`. Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1` and `n` is odd, then the middle character of `s` is not `x`. If `n` is even, or if `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is `x`, then the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n - 1`. `count` is 0, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, and `count2` is either 0 or 1. If `count` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and the loop or if statement is broken if `count2` is less than `count`. If `count2` is equal to or greater than `count` and `count` is equal to 1, `done` is determined based on whether `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, `done` and `count2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True and the loop is broken. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True and the loop is broken. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is reset to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and the loop is broken. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `count` is not greater than 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is increased by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
