Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `done` is `False`
2. `count` is 0
3. `count2` is 0
4. `i` is `t + 1` (Note: `t` is not defined in the initial state, but it doesn't affect the `print` statement)
5. `string` is the new user's input
6. `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`
7. `n` is the length of the new list `s`
8. `x` is the first character of the new `string`
9. If `n` is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged

### Code Snippet to Execute:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The `print('YES')` statement directly prints the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables `done`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, and `x` do not influence the output of this particular print statement. The string `'YES'` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
