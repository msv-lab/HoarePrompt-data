Postcondition: **`done` is `False`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is `t + 1`, `string` is the new user's input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new list `s`, and `x` is the first character of the new `string`. If `n` is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
