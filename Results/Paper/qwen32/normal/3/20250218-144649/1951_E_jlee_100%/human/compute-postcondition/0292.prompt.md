Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has completed all `n` iterations without setting `done` to `True`. `done` remains `False`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is equal to `t`. `string` is the user's input. `s` is a list of characters from `string`. `n` is equal to the length of the list `s`. `x` is the first character of `string`. If `s.count(x) == n`, it means all characters in `s` are the same as `x`. If `s.count(x) == n - 1` and `n` is odd, the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`. If `s.count(x) != n - 1` or `n` is even, no additional changes occur based on the if-else block.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `done` remains `False` if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is set to `True`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. `count2` is less than or equal to `count`, and if `count2` was less than `count`, it is updated to `count` if `count` is greater than 1. `i` remains equal to `t`, `string` remains the user's input, `s` remains a list of characters from `string`, and `n` remains greater than 0. `x` remains the first character of `string`. If `count` is greater than 0, `done` is `True` if `count` is greater than 1 or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or if `count2 < count` when `s[j] != x`; otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. `i` remains equal to `t`, `string` remains the user's input, `s` remains a list of characters from `string`, and `n` remains greater than 0. `x` remains the first character of `string`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j`. If `s[j] != x` and `count2` equals `count`, `count2` is 0 if `count <= 1`; otherwise, `count2` remains unchanged. If `s[j] == x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. `j` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `done`, `count`, or `count2` based on the `else` part, which is absent.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, or if `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. `i` remains equal to `t`. `string` remains the user's input. `s` remains a list of characters from `string`. `n` remains greater than 0. `x` remains the first character of `string`. `j` is incremented by 1. `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`. `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `x`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is not greater than 0, none of the conditions in the if part are evaluated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
