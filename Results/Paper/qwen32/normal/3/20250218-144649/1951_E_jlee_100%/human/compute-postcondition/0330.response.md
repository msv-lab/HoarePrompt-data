Postcondition: **`done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains `False`. `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is `t + 1`, `string` is the new user's input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is greater than 0, and `x` is the first character of the new `string`. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
