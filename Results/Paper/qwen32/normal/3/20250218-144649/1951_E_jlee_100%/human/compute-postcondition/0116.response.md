Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`.
- `string` is the input string.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 2.
- The conditions involving `count`, `count2`, `done`, and the characters in `s` are defined, but these do not affect the `print(1)` statement directly.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. Regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`, the `print(1)` statement will always output the integer `1`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
