Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a card game where:
- Each player has `n` cards, and there are `2n` cards in total.
- Cards are labeled from `1` to `n`, with each label appearing exactly twice.
- Players take turns placing cards on the table.
- A player earns a point if a card with the same label is already on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can earn if you play optimally.

### Key Observations
1. **Pairs of Cards**: Since each label appears exactly twice, the maximum number of points you can earn is limited by the number of pairs of cards you have.
2. **Nene's Strategy**: Nene will always play to maximize her score and minimize yours. This means if you have a pair, you can only score on one of the cards in that pair because Nene will ensure you don't score on the second card of the pair if possible.
3. **Optimal Play**: The optimal strategy for you is to play your pairs first to maximize your score, knowing that Nene will counter by playing her pairs optimally.

### Solution Strategy
- Count the number of pairs you have (`pairs`).
- The maximum number of points you can earn is the minimum of:
  - The number of pairs you have (`pairs`).
  - Half the number of cards you have (`n // 2`), because you can only play each card once.

### Program Analysis

The given program implements this strategy in two functions:
1. **`func_1(n, a)`**:
   - Uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each card label in your hand.
   - Counts the number of pairs (`pairs`).
   - Returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - Reads input from standard input.
   - Processes multiple test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Prints the results.

### Verification
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can earn based on the number of pairs and the total number of cards you have.
- The program handles multiple test cases and reads input correctly.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the solution strategy and handles the problem requirements as described.

**Correctness: True**
