Output State: **`n` is `int(data[idx])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, making it `3 + n`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
