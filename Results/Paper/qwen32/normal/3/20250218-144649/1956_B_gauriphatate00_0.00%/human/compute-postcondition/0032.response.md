The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, and `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most 2 times, representing the integers on the cards in your hand.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most 2 times. It returns a value based on the distribution of integers in the list `a`.** 

Since the output conditions are not fully specified, the functionality description is based on the given input constraints. If additional output conditions were provided, they would be incorporated into the description.
