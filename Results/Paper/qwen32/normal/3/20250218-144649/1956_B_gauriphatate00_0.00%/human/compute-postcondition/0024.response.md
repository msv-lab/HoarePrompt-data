To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the provided initial and intermediate states.

### Loop Behavior:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of iterations, set to `int(data[0])`.
   - `idx` starts at 1.

2. **Each Iteration**:
   - `n` is read from `data[idx]`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[idx+1:idx+1+n]`.
   - `idx` is incremented by `n+1`.
   - The result of `func_1(n, a)` is appended to `results`.
   - `t` is decremented by 1.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until `t` reaches 0.

### Final Output State:
- **`t`**: After all iterations, `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- **`idx`**: `idx` will be `1 + sum(n_i + 1) for all i in range(t)`, where `n_i` is the value of `n` in the i-th iteration.
- **`results`**: `results` will contain the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.

### Calculation of `idx`:
Given that we have executed the loop `t` times, the final value of `idx` can be calculated as follows:
- After the first iteration, `idx` becomes `1 + (n_1 + 1)`.
- After the second iteration, `idx` becomes `1 + (n_1 + 1) + (n_2 + 1)`.
- After the third iteration, `idx` becomes `1 + (n_1 + 1) + (n_2 + 1) + (n_3 + 1)`.
- Continuing this pattern, after `t` iterations, `idx` becomes `1 + sum(n_i + 1 for i in range(t))`.

### Output State:
- `n` will be the value of `n` from the last iteration.
- `a` will be the list of integers from the last iteration.
- `data` remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
- `idx` will be `1 + sum(n_i + 1 for i in range(t))`.
- `t` will be 0.
- `results` will contain the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`n` is the value of `n` from the last iteration, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `1 + sum(n_i + 1 for i in range(t))`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be the number of cards from the last set processed, `a` will be the list of card values from that last set, `data` remains unchanged as the initial list of strings, `idx` will point to the position right after the last set of card values, `t` will be 0 indicating no more iterations are left, and `results` will contain the outcomes of `func_1(n, a)` for each set of cards processed.
