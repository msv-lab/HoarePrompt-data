The code snippet appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list. The values of `n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, `t`, and the initial `results` list are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the only change is that `results` now contains an additional element, which is the result of `func_1(n, a)`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[idx - n])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**.
