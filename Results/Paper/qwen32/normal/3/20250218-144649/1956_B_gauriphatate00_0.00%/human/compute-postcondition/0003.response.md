The code snippet `t = int(data[idx])` takes the element at index `idx` from the list `data`, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The variables `n`, `a`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 0, `t` is an integer value equal to `int(data[0])`.**
