To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:

The game involves two players who each receive `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards. Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck. Players take turns placing cards on a table, and a player scores a point if the card they place has already been placed on the table. The goal is to maximize your points assuming Nene, the opponent, plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize your points.

### Key Observations:

1. **Pairs of Cards**: Since each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice, there are `n` pairs of cards in total.
2. **Turns**: There are `2n` turns in total, with each player taking `n` turns.
3. **Optimal Play**: Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. This means she will try to place her cards in such a way that she scores points whenever possible and prevents you from scoring points whenever she can.

### Strategy:

- **Your Optimal Play**: To maximize your score, you should aim to place cards that will allow you to score points. This means placing cards that have already been placed by Nene.
- **Nene's Optimal Play**: Nene will aim to place cards that prevent you from scoring points. However, since there are `n` pairs and she plays optimally, she can at most prevent you from scoring more than `n//2` points. This is because, in the worst case, she can play all her cards in such a way that you only get points from the remaining pairs.

### Calculation:

- **Pairs in Your Hand**: Count the number of pairs in your hand (i.e., numbers that appear twice).
- **Maximum Points**: The maximum number of points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs in your hand and `n//2`. This is because Nene can prevent you from scoring more than `n//2` points, and you can only score points from the pairs you have.

### Program Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the maximum number of points you can get by counting the number of pairs in your hand and taking the minimum of this count and `n//2`.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the strategy and logic described above. It accurately calculates the maximum number of points you can get by considering the number of pairs in your hand and the constraint imposed by Nene's optimal play.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
