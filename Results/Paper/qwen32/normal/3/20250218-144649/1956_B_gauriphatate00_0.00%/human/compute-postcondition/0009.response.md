The code snippet updates the list `a` by mapping the string elements from `data` starting at index `idx` and extending for `n` elements to integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[1])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 2, `t` is an integer value equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language: The list `a` is now a list of `n` integers, each obtained by converting the corresponding strings in `data` starting from index `idx` and extending for `n` elements. All other variables retain their initial values.
