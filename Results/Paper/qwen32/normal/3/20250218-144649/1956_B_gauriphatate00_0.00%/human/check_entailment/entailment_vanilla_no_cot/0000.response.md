To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem is about playing a card game where each player (you and Nene) has `n` cards. Each card has an integer from 1 to `n` and each integer appears exactly twice in the total deck. Players take turns placing cards on a table, and a player earns a point if the card they place matches a card already on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. The task is to determine the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally.

### Key Points

1. **Optimal Play for Nene**: Nene will always try to maximize her score and minimize your score. This means she will try to place cards that will not give you points whenever possible but will give her points.

2. **Your Strategy**: You need to maximize your points. To do this optimally, you should try to place cards that will match cards already on the table, but also be mindful of Nene's optimal play.

3. **Counting Pairs**: The number of points you can get is essentially the number of pairs of cards you have minus the number of pairs Nene can force you to miss out on. If you have `k` pairs of cards, the maximum number of points you can get is `k` if Nene doesn't interfere. However, since Nene plays optimally, she can force you to miss out on some points.

4. **Algorithm**: The algorithm in `func_1` counts the number of pairs in your hand (`pairs`). Since Nene plays optimally, the maximum points you can secure is the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2` because Nene can always force you to miss out on some points if you have more pairs than `n // 2`.

### Program Analysis

- **`func_1(n, a)`**: This function counts the number of pairs in your hand using `Counter` from the `collections` module. It then returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

- **`func_2()`**: This function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness of the Program

The algorithm in `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by considering the number of pairs you have and the fact that Nene will play optimally to minimize your score. Since the problem guarantees that each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in your hand, the logic of counting pairs and taking the minimum with `n // 2` is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**
