The provided `print` statement is:

```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement explicitly prints the values `-1` and `-1`.

The initial state and other variables described do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it directly prints the values `-1` and `-1` without referencing any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **-1, -1**
