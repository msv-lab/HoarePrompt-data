In the provided for loop, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute based on the value obtained from `int(input())`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is the input value itself, which determines how many times the loop will run.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `N` is an integer read from input
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5
- `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`
- `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`
- `s` is the index of the last change in `nums` or `N` if the last element is different from the previous one
- `e` is 0
- `num` is `nums[N]`
- `arr` contains tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`

The only state that can be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value that determines the number of iterations. To ensure the loop executes, this input value must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `s` is the index of the last change in `nums` or `N` if the last element is different from the previous one; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[N]`; `arr` contains tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; The input value for the loop must be at least 1**
