The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1, -1`. Let's break down the context provided in the initial state to understand the values being printed.

The initial state describes various variables and their relationships, but the key point for this specific print statement is that it directly prints `-1, -1` without referencing any of the other variables or conditions mentioned. Therefore, the values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly stated in the `print` statement itself.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
2. This statement explicitly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`.
3. No other variables or conditions in the initial state affect the output of this specific print statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `N`, `nums`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, or `eli`.

Output: **-1, -1**
