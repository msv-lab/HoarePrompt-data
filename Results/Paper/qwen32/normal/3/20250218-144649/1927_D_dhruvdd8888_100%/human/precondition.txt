The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). Then, an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) is given, followed by q queries, each consisting of two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
