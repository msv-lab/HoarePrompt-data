To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(s, e + 1)`, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the roles and values of the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `N`: An integer read from input.
   - `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `nums`: A list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`.
   - `q`: An integer such that \(0 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\) (decremented by 1).
   - `num`: The last element of `nums`, which is `-1`.
   - `arr`: A list of tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `LA`: The last index of `arr` (i.e., `len(arr) - 1`).
   - `l` and `r`: Integers read from input such that \(1 \leq l < r \leq n + 1\).
   - `eli`: The index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted.
   - `s`: The start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `e`: The end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.

2. **Understanding `s` and `e`:**
   - `s` and `e` are derived from the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `s` is the `start_index` of that tuple.
   - `e` is the `end_index` of that tuple.

3. **Interpreting `print(s, e + 1)`:**
   - The statement will print the start index `s` and one more than the end index `e` of a specific segment in `arr`.

### Explanation of Output:

- `s` is the start index of the segment found at `min(eli, LA)`.
- `e + 1` is the end index of the segment found at `min(eli, LA)`, incremented by 1.

Given the information, the exact numerical values of `s` and `e` depend on the specific values of `arr`, `eli`, and `LA`, which are not explicitly provided. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:

Output: **s, e + 1 (where `s` is the start index and `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`)**

This description accurately captures the values that will be printed based on the given initial state.
