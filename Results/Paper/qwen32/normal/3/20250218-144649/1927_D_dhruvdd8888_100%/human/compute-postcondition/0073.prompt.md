Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `s` is the index of the last change in `nums` or `N` if the last element is different from the previous one; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[N]`; `arr` contains tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1 or s > r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N or e < l:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`; `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`; `num` is `nums[N]`; `arr` contains tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from input such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `eli` is the index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted. If `s` > `l`, `s` remains the same unless `s` equals 1 or `s` is greater than `r`, in which case the conditions remain unchanged. If `s` <= `l`, then `e` is such that if `e` >= `r`, `e` remains the same, otherwise `e` is less than `r`. Additionally, if `e` is less than `N` or `e` is less than `l`, the condition `e < N or e < l` holds. Otherwise, `e` is less than or equal to `N` and `e` is greater than or equal to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`; `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`; `num` is `nums[N]`; `arr` contains tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from input such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `eli` is the index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted. If `s > l`, the conditions on the variables remain the same regardless of whether `s == 1 or s > r` or not. If `s <= l`, the state remains as described, and if `e >= r`, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 0 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5 (decremented by 1); `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`; `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`; `num` is `nums[N]`; `arr` contains tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from input such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `eli` is the index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted. If `s` > `l`, the state remains unchanged. If `s` <= `l`, the state remains unchanged if `e` >= `r`. In all cases, the values of `t`, `N`, `n`, `nums`, `q`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, and `eli` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
