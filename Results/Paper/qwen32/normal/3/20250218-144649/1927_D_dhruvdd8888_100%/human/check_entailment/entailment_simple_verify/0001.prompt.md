You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, we have an array `a` and a series of queries. Each query specifies a subarray `a[l:r+1]`, and we need to find two distinct indices `i` and `j` within this subarray such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If no such pair exists, we should output `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis

The program starts by reading the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the array and the number of queries. The program then attempts to preprocess the array to facilitate efficient query handling.

#### Preprocessing

The program uses a list `arr` to store segments of the array where all elements are the same. Each element of `arr` is a tuple `(s, e, num)`, where `s` and `e` are the start and end indices of a segment, and `num` is the value of the elements in that segment.

#### Query Handling

For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or after the left boundary of the query. It then checks the conditions to determine if a valid pair of indices can be found within the query range.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Query Handling:**
   - The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the logic for determining if a valid pair exists is flawed.
   - The conditions for printing `-1 -1` are not correctly implemented. For example, if the segment starts after the left boundary and ends before the right boundary, the program might incorrectly print `-1 -1`.
   - The program does not correctly account for the possibility that the segment might be within the query range but not cover the entire range.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the query range contains only one unique element correctly.
   - The program does not handle cases where the query range contains multiple segments correctly.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the query handling and the lack of comprehensive handling of edge cases, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**

The program contains logical errors in handling queries and does not correctly account for all possible scenarios, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
