To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, e + 1)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the relationships between the variables involved.

### Key Variables and Their Definitions:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4 (though `t` is not directly used in the print statement).
- `N`: An integer read from input.
- `n`: An integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5.
- `nums`: A list of `n + 1` integers, where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`.
- `q`: An integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of queries.
- `l` and `r`: Integers read from input for each query, such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`.
- `arr`: A list of tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
- `LA`: `len(arr) - 1`.
- `eli`: The index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted.
- `s`: The start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
- `e`: The end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `eli`:**
   - `eli` is the index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted. This means `eli` is the position in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` begins or should begin.

2. **Determine `s` and `e`:**
   - `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - Since `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `min(eli, LA)` ensures that we don't go out of bounds of `arr`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(s, e + 1)`.
   - `s` is the start index of the segment.
   - `e + 1` is the end index of the segment plus one, which typically represents the next index after the segment ends.

### Output Explanation:
- The output will be the start index `s` of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)` and the end index of the segment plus one `e + 1`.

Given the information, the precise output can be described as follows:

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`, and e is the end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`)**
