Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `s` is 1 if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `s` remains 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` contains the tuple (1, 1, `nums[0]`) if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged; `i` is 1.**
