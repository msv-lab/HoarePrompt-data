The provided code snippet reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `nums`. Given the initial state, `n` is the number of integers that are expected to be read and stored in the list `a`. After executing the code, `nums` will hold the list of integers read from the input, and the variable `n` will still retain its value as it is not changed by this snippet. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `q`, `l`, `r`) remain unaffected by this code execution.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
