The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1, -1`. This statement is independent of the values of the variables `t`, `N`, `n`, `nums`, `q`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, and `eli` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement directly specifies the values to be printed.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
2. This statement explicitly specifies the values `-1` and `-1` to be printed.
3. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement that would alter the values `-1` and `-1`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1, -1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
