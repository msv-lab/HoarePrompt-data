Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for finding two different elements within the given range `[l, r]` is flawed. Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Handling of Consecutive Elements**: The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts within the range `[l, r]`. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the segment starts before `l` but ends within `[l, r]`.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the range `[l, r]` is very small (e.g., `l = r-1`) and the elements at `l` and `r` are different.

3. **Output Logic**: The logic for printing the indices is incorrect. For example, the condition `if s > l:` is not sufficient to determine if there is a valid pair of indices within the range `[l, r]`.

4. **Appending `-1` to `nums`**: Appending `-1` to `nums` might cause issues, especially if the array already contains `-1` as a valid element.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q = int(input())
    
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split())
        l -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        r -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        
        # Use a set to find unique elements in the range [l, r]
        unique_elements = set()
        found = False
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            if nums[i] in unique_elements:
                print(i + 1, l + 1)  # i + 1 and l + 1 are the 1-based indices
                found = True
                break
            unique_elements.add(nums[i])
        
        if not found:
            # If no pair found, check if there are at least two different elements
            if len(unique_elements) > 1:
                first, second = unique_elements.pop(), unique_elements.pop()
                for i in range(l, r + 1):
                    if nums[i] == first:
                        first_index = i + 1
                    elif nums[i] == second:
                        second_index = i + 1
                print(first_index, second_index)
            else:
                print(-1, -1)
```

This corrected version uses a set to track unique elements within the range `[l, r]` and checks if there are at least two different elements. If so, it finds and prints the indices of these elements. If no such pair exists, it prints `-1 -1`.
