The code snippet `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. The other variables (`test_cases`, `input`, `data`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is 3; `n` is the first integer from `data[1]`; `x` is the second integer from `data[1]`; `y` is the third integer from `data[1]`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from `data[2]` to integers.**
