Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers); `results` is an empty list; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers); `results` is an empty list; `freq` is a dictionary that may contain the `current_pair` as a key with its corresponding value incremented by 1 if `current_pair` was already in `freq`, or with a value of 1 if `current_pair` was not in `freq`; `count` is 0; `rx` is `((-test_cases[0][3][0] % test_cases[0][1]) + test_cases[0][1]) % test_cases[0][1]`; `ry` is `test_cases[0][1] % test_cases[0][2]`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `count` is set to the value of `freq[current_pair]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `count` remains 0 and `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers); `results` is an empty list; `freq` is a dictionary that contains the `current_pair` as a key with its corresponding value incremented by 1 if `current_pair` was already in `freq`, or with a value of 1 if `current_pair` was not in `freq`; `count` is `count + freq[(rx, ry)]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `a` is the next element in `arr` if there are any remaining elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers); `results` is an empty list; `freq` is a dictionary that contains the `current_pair` as a key with its corresponding value incremented by 1 if `current_pair` was already in `freq`, or with a value of 1 if `current_pair` was not in `freq`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `a` is `next_a`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is incremented by `freq[(rx, ry)]`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the value of `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
