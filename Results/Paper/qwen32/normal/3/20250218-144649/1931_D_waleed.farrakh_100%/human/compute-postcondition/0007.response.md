The code snippet converts a string from `data` at the index `idx + 1` into a list of integers and assigns it to the variable `arr`. Given the initial state, `idx` is 1, so `data[idx + 1]` refers to the second element of the `data` list (since indexing starts from 0). This element is split by spaces and each part is converted to an integer, forming the list `arr`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is 1; `n` is the first integer from `data[1]`; `x` is the second integer from `data[1]`; `y` is the third integer from `data[1]`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from `data[2]` to integers.**
