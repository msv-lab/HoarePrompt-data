To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples `((n, x, y, arr), ...)`, where:
  - `t` is greater than 0.
  - Each tuple contains:
    - `n`: an integer.
    - `x`: an integer.
    - `y`: an integer.
    - `arr`: a list of integers.
- `results` must contain at least one element.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a `print(result)` statement.
- The variable `result` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state or code snippet.
- Given that the `results` list is mentioned to contain at least one element, it is reasonable to infer that `result` might be an element from the `results` list. However, we do not have specific information about the contents of the `results` list or which element of `results` is being referred to as `result`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact value of `result` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the `results` list.

Output: **result (where result is an element from the results list)**
