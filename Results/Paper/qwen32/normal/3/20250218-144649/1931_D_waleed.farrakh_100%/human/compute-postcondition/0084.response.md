The code snippet `freq[current_pair] = 1` updates the `freq` dictionary by assigning the value `1` to the key `current_pair`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that includes the key `(rx, ry)` with the value `1`; `count` remains 0; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `arr[0] % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`**
