The code snippet provided calculates `rx` using the formula `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`. Here, `a` is an element from the list `arr`, and `x` is an integer from the tuple in `test_cases`.

Given the initial state, `a` is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, so we will assume `a` is an element from the list `arr` in the tuple of `test_cases`. Since we don't have a specific value for `a`, we will keep it as `a` in our output state.

The variables `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are all updated or initialized based on the next tuple in `test_cases`, but since the code snippet only involves `rx` and `a`, we will only update `rx` in our output state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, where the first tuple contains `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers with at least one element); `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is 0; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`.**
