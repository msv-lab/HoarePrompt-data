The code snippet provided updates the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` by mapping them to integers from the split string at `data[idx]`. Given the initial state, `idx` is 5, so `data[5]` is used to update `n`, `x`, and `y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `((n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr))`; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` is 1; `idx` is 5; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from splitting and converting `data[5]` to integers; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from `data[4]` to integers.**

In natural language, the output state means that `n`, `x`, and `y` have been updated to the integer values from the string at `data[5]`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
