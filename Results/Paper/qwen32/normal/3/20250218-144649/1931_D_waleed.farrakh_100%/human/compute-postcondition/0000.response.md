The provided code snippet only includes `input = sys.stdin.read`, which reads all input from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. This does not change the values of `test_cases` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The variable `input` is now assigned the entire input as a string.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5), integers `x` and `y` (1 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9), and a list `arr` of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9); `input` is a string containing the entire input.**
