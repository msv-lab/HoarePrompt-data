Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples `((n, x, y, arr), ...)`, `input` is a string containing the entire input, `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `idx` is `1 + 2*t`, `results` is the output of `func_1(test_cases)`**

Explanation: The code snippet executes the function `func_1` with `test_cases` as its argument and assigns the result to the variable `results`. All other variables (`test_cases`, `input`, `data`, `t`, and `idx`) remain unchanged.
