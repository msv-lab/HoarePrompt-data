Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, where the first tuple contains `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers with at least one element); `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that contains the tuple `(rx, ry)`; `count` is 0; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`. The current tuple `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`.**
