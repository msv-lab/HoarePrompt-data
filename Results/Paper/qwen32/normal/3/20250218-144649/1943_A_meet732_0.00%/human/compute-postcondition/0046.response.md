The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is the next element in the list `a`. The variable `cntl` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the operation, it is assumed to be a list where indexing with `i` is valid and it contains elements that can be incremented.

Given the operation, the value at `cntl[i]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `i` is the next element in the list `a`; `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.**
