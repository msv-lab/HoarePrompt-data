The `print(0)` statement will print the integer `0`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The variable `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- The variable `n` is an input integer.
- The list `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- The list `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0.

However, none of these variables or lists are used in the `print(0)` statement. The statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
