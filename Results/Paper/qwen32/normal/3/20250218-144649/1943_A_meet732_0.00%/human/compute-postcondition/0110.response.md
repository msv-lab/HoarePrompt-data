Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`, and `n` is an input integer. If `cntl[0]` is equal to 0, the program continues without further action. Otherwise, the loop prints the first `j` (from 1 to `n`) for which `cntl[j]` becomes 0 or when `j` reaches `n`.**
