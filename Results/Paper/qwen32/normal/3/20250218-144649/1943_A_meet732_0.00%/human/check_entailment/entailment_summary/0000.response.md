### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and its logic to determine if it correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game is played optimally by Alice and Bob.

1. **Initialization and Counting**:
    - The program initializes a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`. The size of `cntl` is `n + 1` because the numbers in `a` range from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Immediate Check for 0**:
    - If the count of `0` in `a` (`cntl[0]`) is `0`, the program immediately prints `0`. This is correct because if `0` is not in `a`, the MEX of any subset of `a` (including `c`) cannot be `0`.

3. **Determine the MEX**:
    - The variable `c` is initialized to the minimum of `2` and `cntl[0]`. This logic is a bit tricky and requires understanding the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
    - The program then iterates through each number `j` from `1` to `n`:
        - If the count of `j` in `a` is less than `2` (`cntl[j] < 2`), it decrements `c` by `1`. This is because Alice will always pick `0` first if available, and then the first number with a count less than `2` will be the MEX.
        - If `c` becomes `0` or `j` reaches `n`, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop. This means that `j` is the smallest number that is not present in `c` after the game ends.

### Analysis of the Program Logic:

- **Alice's Optimal Strategy**:
    - Alice wants to maximize the MEX. If `0` is present, she will pick it first to ensure that MEX can be at least `1`. If `0` is not present, MEX is `0`.

- **Bob's Optimal Strategy**:
    - Bob wants to minimize the MEX. He will pick numbers that prevent Alice from maximizing the MEX.

- **Counting and MEX Calculation**:
    - The program correctly identifies the smallest number `j` with a count less than `2` in `a`, which aligns with the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game is played optimally by Alice and Bob. The program handles edge cases such as when `0` is not present in `a` and correctly identifies the smallest number with a count less than `2` as the MEX.
