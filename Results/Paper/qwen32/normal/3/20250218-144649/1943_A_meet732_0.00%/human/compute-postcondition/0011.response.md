Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0.**
