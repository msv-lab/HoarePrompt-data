The code snippet provided decrements the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` is either 0 or 1, if `c` was 1, it will become 0, and if `c` was 0, it will become -1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 0 or -1, and `j` is incremented by 1**.
