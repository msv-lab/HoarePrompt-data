The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `cntl` by 1. However, the initial state provided does not include any information about the list `cntl` or the variable `i`. Therefore, we can only describe the change to `cntl[i]` without specifying its exact value.

Given that `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and there's no information about `cntl` or `i`, we assume `cntl` is a list that has at least `i+1` elements (since `cntl[i]` is accessed).

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.**
