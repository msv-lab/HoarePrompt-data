Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`; `n` is at least 1; `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `not c` or `j == n`.**
