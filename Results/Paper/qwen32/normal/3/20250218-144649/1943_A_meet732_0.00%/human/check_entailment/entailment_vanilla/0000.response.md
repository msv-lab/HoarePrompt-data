Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a`, with Alice aiming to maximize the MEX of the resulting array `c` and Bob aiming to minimize it. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

### Key Observations
1. **Turns and MEX**: Since Alice and Bob take turns and Alice starts, the sequence of moves affects the final composition of `c`. However, the optimal strategy for both players can be analyzed based on the frequency of elements in `a`.

2. **Frequency Count**: The frequency of each element in `a` is crucial. If an element appears less than twice, it will be part of `c` (because one instance can be taken by Alice, and Bob cannot take the same element again).

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - If `0` does not appear in `a`, the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer.
   - If `0` appears, Alice can ensure that `0` is in `c` by picking it on her first turn. The MEX will be the smallest integer greater than `0` that does not appear twice in `a`.

### Program Analysis
The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `a`.
2. **Frequency Count**: It counts the frequency of each element in `a` up to `n`.
3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - If `0` does not appear in `a`, it prints `0`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the MEX based on the frequency count:
     - `c` is initialized to `min(2, cntl[0])`, which means it considers the first two occurrences of `0`.
     - It iterates through the elements from `1` to `n`. If an element appears less than twice, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if the current element is `n`. If either condition is met, it prints the current element as the MEX.

### Correctness Analysis
- **Handling `0`**: The program correctly handles the case where `0` does not appear in `a` by printing `0`.
- **Iterating through Elements**: The program iterates through elements from `1` to `n` and checks their frequency. If an element appears less than twice, it is considered for MEX calculation.
- **MEX Calculation**: The logic of decrementing `c` and checking conditions ensures that the smallest non-negative integer not appearing twice is selected as the MEX.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
