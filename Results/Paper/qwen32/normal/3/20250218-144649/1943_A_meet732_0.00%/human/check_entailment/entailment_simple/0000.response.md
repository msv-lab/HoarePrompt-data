### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the final score of the game based on the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after all elements have been moved from `a` to `c` and then deleted from `a` by Alice and Bob alternately. 

The strategy of the game is as follows:
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The program counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using a list `cntl`. The logic of the program is based on the following observations:
1. If `0` is not present in the array `a` (`cntl[0] == 0`), the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer.
2. If `0` is present, the MEX can be at least `1` (since `0` is present). The program then checks the occurrences of the numbers starting from `1` to `n`. If a number `j` appears less than twice, it can be the MEX because it means that either Alice or Bob can avoid adding it to `c` twice, thus `j` will not be in `c` at the end of the game.

The logic correctly identifies the smallest `j` such that `cntl[j] < 2`. This is because:
- If `cntl[j] < 2`, it means that either Alice or Bob can avoid adding `j` to `c` twice, ensuring that `j` remains the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.
- The loop starts from `1`, ensuring that `0` is already considered separately.
- The loop breaks as soon as it finds such a `j`, which is the smallest possible MEX.

The program handles all edge cases:
- If `0` is not present in `a`, it correctly returns `0`.
- If `0` is present, it correctly finds the smallest `j` such that `cntl[j] < 2`.

### Correctness:

Given the problem constraints and the provided program, the logic is correct and aligns with the optimal strategies of both players. The program efficiently computes the MEX by counting occurrences and checking the conditions as described.

Correctness: **True**
