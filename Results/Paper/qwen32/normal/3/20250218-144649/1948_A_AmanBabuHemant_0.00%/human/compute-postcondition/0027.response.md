Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is defined as `t-1`. However, it's not clear what `t` was initially or what its value is now. Since `t` is not used in the print statement, its value is irrelevant for the output.
- `n` is an input integer. The exact value of `n` is not given, but it's used in the calculation of `s`.
- `s` is a string constructed by repeating the substring `'110'` a number of times equal to `n // 2`. This means that `s` will be a string consisting of the pattern `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.

### Output:
The output will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
