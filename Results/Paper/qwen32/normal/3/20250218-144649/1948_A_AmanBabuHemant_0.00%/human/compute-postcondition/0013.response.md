Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, then no additional changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, then `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it remains less than 200; otherwise, the length of `s` is 200 or more.**
