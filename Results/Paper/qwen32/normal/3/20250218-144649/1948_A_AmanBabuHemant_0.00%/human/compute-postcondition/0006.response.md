The code snippet assigns the variable `s` the value of the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. Given that `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will result in an integer value, and the string `'110'` will be repeated that many times.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 50; `n` is an input integer, and `n` is even; `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.**
