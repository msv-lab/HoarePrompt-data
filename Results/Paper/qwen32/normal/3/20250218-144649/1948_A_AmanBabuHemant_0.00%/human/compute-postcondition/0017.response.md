The code snippet assigns the variable `s` the value of the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Given that `n // 2` is an integer division, the number of times `'110'` is repeated is the integer part of `n` divided by 2. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 49; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.**
