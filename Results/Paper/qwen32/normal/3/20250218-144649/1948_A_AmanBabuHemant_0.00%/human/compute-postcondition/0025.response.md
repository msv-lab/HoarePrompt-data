In the given task, the initial state describes variables `t` and `n`. However, the `print` statement only contains the string `'NO'` and does not reference these variables. Therefore, the values of `t` and `n` do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state mentions `t` is `t-1` and `n` is an input integer. However, these values are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Thus, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
