You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and determines if a specific string of length `n` can be constructed. If `n` is even and the resulting string length does not exceed 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to create a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program needs to output "YES" followed by the string if such a string can be constructed, or "NO" if it cannot.

### Key Points:
1. **Special Character Definition**: A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
2. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 50` (number of test cases)
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 50` (number of special characters required)
3. **Output Requirements**:
   - If no suitable string exists, output "NO".
   - Otherwise, output "YES" followed by a string of length at most 200 with exactly `n` special characters.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
2. **Checking for Odd `n`**: If `n` is odd, it immediately prints "NO". This part is correct because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters based on the definition.
3. **Constructing the String**: If `n` is even, it constructs a string using the pattern `'110' * (n // 2)`. However, this pattern does not use uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem description, and it does not guarantee that the string will have exactly `n` special characters.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Character Set**: The program uses `'110'` instead of uppercase Latin letters.
2. **Special Character Count**: The program assumes that the pattern `'110'` will create the required number of special characters, which is not necessarily true. The pattern `'110'` will create 2 special characters for each `'110'`, but the program does not explicitly check the count of special characters.
3. **String Length Check**: Although the program checks if the length of the string is less than 200, this is not the primary issue here. The main issue is the incorrect construction of the string and the character set used.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is incorrect because it does not generate a string using uppercase Latin letters and does not guarantee the correct number of special characters.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
