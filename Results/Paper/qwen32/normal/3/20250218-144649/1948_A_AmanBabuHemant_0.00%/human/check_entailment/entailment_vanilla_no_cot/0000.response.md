Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it constructs the string using '110' instead of uppercase Latin letters, which contradicts the problem's requirement. Additionally, the logic for determining the existence of a suitable string is flawed. The problem states that there must be exactly `n` special characters, and the program only checks if `n` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if a suitable string can be constructed. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AB')  # Special character is the first 'A' or the second 'B'
        elif n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Construct a string with exactly n special characters
            # For example, "AABBAABB..." will have 2 special characters per "AABB"
            s = 'AABB' * (n // 2)
            print('YES')
            print(s)

func()
```

This corrected version constructs a string using uppercase Latin letters and ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string.
