Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

Initial State:
- `t` is defined as `t-1`. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is defined as the string `'110'` repeated `(n // 2)` times.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(s)
```

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is constructed by repeating the string `'110'` for `(n // 2)` times. The `//` operator performs integer division, meaning it divides `n` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
- The `print(s)` statement will output the constructed string `s`.

Output:
Since `s` is `'110'` repeated `(n // 2)` times, the exact output depends on the value of `n`. However, we can describe the output precisely.

Output: **'110' repeated (n // 2) times (where n is the input integer)**
