The code appends the absolute value of the difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the `mex` list. Given that `minn` is 0 and `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `abs(arr[i] - minn)` simplifies to `abs(arr[i])`, which is the non-negative value of `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mex` is a list containing `abs(arr[i])`, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0, and `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0.**
