The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` has already been incremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `arr[i] > 0`, `mex` has `minn` appended to it, and if `minn` was equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, `minn` remains unchanged. If `arr[i] <= 0`, `mex` has `abs(arr[i] - minn)` appended to it, and if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.**

Since `i` has been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be that incremented value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration (i.e., `i` is incremented by 1 from the start of the previous iteration).** 

To be more specific, if `i` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, then at the end of the previous iteration, `i` became `k + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1.** 

Since `i` is already incremented by 1, we just need to reflect that in the state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1.**

To make it clear, if `i` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Since we need to reflect the incremented value of `i`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1.**

To be precise:

If `i` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Since `i` is the only variable that can be adjusted and it has been incremented by 1:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1.**
