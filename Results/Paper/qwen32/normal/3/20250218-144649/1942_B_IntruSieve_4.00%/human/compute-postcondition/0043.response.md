The loop iterates over each element in the list `mex` and prints it. Given the initial state and the outputs after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute until all elements in the list `mex` have been printed.

Since the loop prints each element of `mex` in sequence, after all iterations, the entire list `mex` will have been printed. The variables `minn` and `maxx` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers where all elements have been printed, `minn` is an integer, and `maxx` is an integer representing the maximum value in `mex`.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has finished executing, and all elements of the list `mex` have been printed to the console, while the values of `minn` and `maxx` remain as they were initially.
