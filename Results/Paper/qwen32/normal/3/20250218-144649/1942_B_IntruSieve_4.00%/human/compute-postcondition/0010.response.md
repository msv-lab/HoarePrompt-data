The value of `minn` is updated to be `maxx + 1`. Given that `maxx` is initially 1, `minn` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `mex`, and `maxx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mex` is [0], `minn` is 2, and `maxx` is 1, and `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**
