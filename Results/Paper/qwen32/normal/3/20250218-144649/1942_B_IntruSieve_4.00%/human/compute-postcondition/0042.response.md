To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State:
- `mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be at least 2.
- `minn` is an integer (though its exact value is not specified in the precondition, it is not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
- `maxx` is an integer representing the maximum value in `mex`.
- `itm` is the next element in `mex`.

### Key Points:
- The variable `itm` is described as "the next element in `mex`". However, the exact position of `itm` in the list `mex` is not specified. Given that `itm` is referred to as "the next element", it likely refers to the element that comes after some current element, but since no current element is specified, we can assume `itm` is the first element of the list `mex` for the sake of providing a precise answer.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(itm, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `itm` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- Since `itm` is described as "the next element in `mex`" and we are not given any specific position, we can reasonably assume it refers to the first element of the list `mex` for the purpose of this explanation.

### Conclusion:
- The output will be the first element of the list `mex` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **itm (where itm is the first element of the list mex)**

If we assume `itm` is indeed the first element of `mex`, and if `mex` is, for example, `[5, 3, 8, 1]`, then `itm` would be `5`, and the output would be:
Output: **5 **

However, without a specific list `mex`, the most precise description is:
Output: **itm (where itm is the first element of the list mex)**
