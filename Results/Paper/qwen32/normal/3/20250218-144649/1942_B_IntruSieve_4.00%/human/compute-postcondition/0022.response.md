Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `mex` has `minn` appended to it. If `minn` was equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, `minn` remains unchanged.**
