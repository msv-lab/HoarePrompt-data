Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.**

In this output state, `n` has been updated to the value provided by the user input, while `t` and the properties of `a` remain as specified in the initial state.
