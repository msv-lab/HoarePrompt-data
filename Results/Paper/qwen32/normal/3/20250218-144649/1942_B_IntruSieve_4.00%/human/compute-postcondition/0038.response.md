The provided initial state describes the variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet references a variable `itm` which is not mentioned in the initial state. This implies that `itm` must be defined somewhere in the code that is not provided, and its value is necessary to determine the output.

Since `itm` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `itm`.

Output: **itm (where itm is a variable defined elsewhere in the code)**
