The code snippet appends the value of `minn` to the `mex` list. Since `minn` is initially 0, `mex` will now contain the single element 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `minn`, and `maxx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mex` is [0], `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0, and `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**
