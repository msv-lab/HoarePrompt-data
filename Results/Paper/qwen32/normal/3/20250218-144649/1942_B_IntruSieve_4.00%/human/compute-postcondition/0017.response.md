Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, then `mex` is [0], and if `minn` equals `maxx`, `minn` is updated to 2 and `maxx` is updated to 1. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` is a list containing `abs(arr[i])`, `minn` remains 0, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the original `maxx` and `-arr[i]` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`; otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.**
