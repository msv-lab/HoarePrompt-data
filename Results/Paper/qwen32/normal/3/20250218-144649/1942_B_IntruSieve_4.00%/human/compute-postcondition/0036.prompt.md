Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        minn += 1
        if minn == maxx:
            minn = maxx + 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
            maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, then `mex` is [0], and if `minn` equals `maxx`, `minn` is updated to 2 and `maxx` is updated to 1. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` is a list containing `abs(arr[i])`, `minn` remains 0, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the original `maxx` and `-arr[i]` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`; otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `arr[i] > 0`, `mex` has `minn` appended to it, and if `minn` was equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, `minn` remains unchanged. If `arr[i] <= 0`, `mex` has `abs(arr[i] - minn)` appended to it, and if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`. If `arr[i] > 0`, `mex` has `minn` appended to it, and if `minn` was equal to `maxx`, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, `mex` contains an additional element equal to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, and `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)` if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than the original `maxx`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
