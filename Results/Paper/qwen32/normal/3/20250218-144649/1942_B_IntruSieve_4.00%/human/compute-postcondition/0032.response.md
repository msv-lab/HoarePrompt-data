The code snippet `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))` appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the list `mex`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and the precondition that `i` is `i + 1` remain unchanged. The only change is that `mex` now contains an additional element, which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `mex` contains an additional element equal to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`**.
