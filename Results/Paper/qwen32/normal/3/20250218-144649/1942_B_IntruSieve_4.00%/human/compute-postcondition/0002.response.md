The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `mex`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is an empty list.**
