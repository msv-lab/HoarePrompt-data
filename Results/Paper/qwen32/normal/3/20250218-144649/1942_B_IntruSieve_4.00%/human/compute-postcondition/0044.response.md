The given Python code snippet contains a `print()` statement without any arguments inside it. When `print()` is called without any arguments, it outputs an empty line.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning based on the initial state provided:

1. The `mex` list has been printed, but this does not affect the current `print()` statement.
2. `minn` and `maxx` are integers, but they are not used in the `print()` statement.
3. The `print()` statement is empty, meaning it will output nothing except for a newline character.

Given this information, the output of the `print()` statement will be an empty line.

Output: **(an empty line)**
