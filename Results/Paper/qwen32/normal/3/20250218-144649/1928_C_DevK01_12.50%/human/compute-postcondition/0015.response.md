The code snippet `M += [i]` appends the current value of `i` to the list `M`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation, the new value of `i` is added to `M`. The initial state specifies that `q` is a list of tuples and `M` contains the integer `w`. After the operation, `M` will now contain `w` followed by the new value of `i`. The value of `i` itself is not explicitly updated in the provided code snippet, but we can infer that it has been incremented by 1 before this line, as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integers `w` and the new value of `i`.**
