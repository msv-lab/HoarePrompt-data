You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. The function returns a list `M` that includes the integer `w` (the square root of the maximum `n` from all tuples in `q` if `w` is an integer and `w >= x - 1` for any tuple). For each tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, the function includes all integers `i` and `n // i` in the list `M` such that both `i` and `n // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of valid k values for each test case based on the problem description. The function `func_1` and the logic used to calculate `L1` are not directly aligned with the problem's requirements.

Let's analyze the problem and the program step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find how many different values of k fit the given constraints:
     - The sequence of numbers repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
     - The sequence starts with 1, 2, ..., k, then k-1, k-2, ..., 2, and repeats.
     - Given a position `n` and a number `x` Vasya received, we need to determine how many k values can satisfy this arrangement.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sequence length for a given k is 2k - 2.
   - For a position `n`, the number `x` can appear in multiple cycles of the sequence.
   - We need to check if for a given k, the number `x` can appear at position `n` in the sequence.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program calculates `y = n + x` and checks if it is even. This is not directly related to the problem.
   - The function `func_1` seems to be trying to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is not a direct approach to solving the problem.
   - The program does not correctly handle the logic of checking positions within the repeating sequence.

4. **Counterexample:**
   - Let's consider the test case `n = 10`, `x = 2`:
     - The correct k values are 2, 3, 5, 6.
     - The program might not correctly identify these k values due to the flawed logic in `func_1` and the way `L1` is calculated.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly determine the number of valid k values for all test cases.
   - The logic used in `func_1` and the overall approach to solving the problem are not aligned with the problem description.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
