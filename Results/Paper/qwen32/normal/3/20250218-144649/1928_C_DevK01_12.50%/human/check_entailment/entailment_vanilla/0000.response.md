Let's analyze the given Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to determine the number of possible values of `k` for which, in a sequence that repeats every `2k-2` positions, Vasya's position `n` corresponds to the number `x`. The sequence starts with `1, 2, ..., k`, then `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`, and repeats.

### Key Observations:
1. The sequence repeats every `2k-2` positions. 
2. For a given `k`, the sequence within one cycle is `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.
3. For a position `n`, we need to determine if there exists a `k` such that the number at position `n` is `x`.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to find the possible values of `k` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequence. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Check**: It checks if `n + x` is even. This is because the sequence length `2k-2` must be even, and `n + x` being even ensures that `n` and `x` can fit within such a sequence.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values**:
   - It defines a helper function `func_1` which finds divisors of a given number `q` that are at least `x-1`.
   - It calculates `q = (n + x - 2) / 2` and finds divisors of `q` that are at least `x-1` (these potential `k` values).
   - If `n >= 3x - 2`, it also calculates another `q = (n - x) / 2` and finds divisors of this `q` that are at least `x-1`.

4. **Combining Results**: It combines the results from the two sets of divisors, removes duplicates, and counts the number of unique `k` values.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program uses the correct mathematical approach to find possible `k` values by leveraging the periodicity and the properties of divisors.
- It correctly handles the condition that `n + x` must be even.
- It accounts for both possible sequences (increasing and decreasing) within the cycle.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly determine the number of possible `k` values for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
