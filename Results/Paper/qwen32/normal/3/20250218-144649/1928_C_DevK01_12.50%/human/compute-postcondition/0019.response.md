Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, then `M` also contains the new value of `n // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.**
