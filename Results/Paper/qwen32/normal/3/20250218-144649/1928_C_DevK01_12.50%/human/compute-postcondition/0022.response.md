Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integers `w` and `4` if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. `i` is 4, and `w` must be greater than 4. If `i` is less than `x - 1`, `M` remains unchanged as a list containing the integer `w`.**
