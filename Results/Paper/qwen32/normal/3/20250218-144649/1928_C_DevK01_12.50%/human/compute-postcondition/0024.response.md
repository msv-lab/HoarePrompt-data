Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w` and the result of `n // i` for each tuple `(n, x)` in `q` if `q // i >= x - 1`. If `q // i < x - 1`, `M` remains unchanged as a list containing only the integer `w`. `i` is 4, and `w` is greater than 4.**
