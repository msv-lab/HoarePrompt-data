Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list. The variable `w` is an integer and satisfies `w == w // 1` and `w >= x - 1`. The code raises a TypeError.**

In simpler terms: **`q` remains a list of tuples with each tuple containing integers `n` and `x` where 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` has between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is still an empty list. `w` is an integer that meets the conditions `w == w // 1` and `w >= x - 1`. The code raises a TypeError.**
