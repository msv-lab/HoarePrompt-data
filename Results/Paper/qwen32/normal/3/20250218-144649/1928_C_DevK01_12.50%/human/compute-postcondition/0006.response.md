It seems there is a small issue with the provided if condition. The condition `(q % i == 0)` is not valid in the context given because `q` is a list of tuples, not an integer, and `i` is not defined in the precondition. 

However, I will assume you meant to check the divisibility of one of the elements within the tuples. Let's assume the intention was to check if the first element of the first tuple in the list `q` is divisible by some integer `i` (which is not defined in the precondition but should be for the condition to make sense). I'll proceed with that assumption.

Let's assume `i` is an integer provided in the context, and we check the divisibility of `n` (the first element of the first tuple in `q`) by `i`. Here's the revised task:

Precondition: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w` where `w` is an integer and `w > 1`.
if condition:
```
if (q[0][0] % i == 0):
```

Given this, the postcondition would be:

Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w` where `w` is an integer and `w > 1`. The first element of the first tuple in `q` (which is `n`) is divisible by `i`.**

This postcondition retains all the conditions from the precondition and includes the new condition that the first element of the first tuple in `q` is divisible by `i`.
