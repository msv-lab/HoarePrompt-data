The function accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. The function returns a list `M` that includes the integer `w` (the square root of the maximum `n` from all tuples in `q` if `w` is an integer and `w >= x - 1` for any tuple). For each tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, the function includes all integers `i` and `n // i` in the list `M` such that both `i` and `n // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
