Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from solving the problem correctly:

1. **Logic for Determining k**:
   - The program attempts to find values of k by checking conditions related to the position `n` and the number `x` received by Vasya. However, the logic for determining k is not correctly implemented.
   - The program uses a helper function `func_1` which seems to be intended to find divisors of a number, but it is not correctly used to determine the values of k that fit the problem's constraints.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle all edge cases. For example, it does not properly check all possible values of k that could fit the given constraints.
   - The condition `if y % 2 != 0` is used to immediately return 0 if `y = n + x` is odd. However, this is not a correct way to determine if there are no valid k values.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves iterating over possible values of k and checking if the given position `n` and number `x` can be achieved with that k.
   - For each k, the pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions. Therefore, the position `n` modulo `2k - 2` should match the pattern for the number `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_valid_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length
        if position_in_cycle < k - 1 and position_in_cycle + 1 == x:
            count += 1
        elif position_in_cycle >= k - 1 and 2 * k - 2 - position_in_cycle == x:
            count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_k(n, x))
```

This corrected program iterates over possible values of k and checks if the given position `n` and number `x` can be achieved with that k by considering the repeating pattern.
