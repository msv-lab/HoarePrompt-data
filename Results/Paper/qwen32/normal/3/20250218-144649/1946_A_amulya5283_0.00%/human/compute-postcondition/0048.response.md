The code calculates the median index of the list `arr` by performing integer division of `n` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` will point to the middle element if `n` is odd, or the lower of the two middle elements if `n` is even.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`.**
