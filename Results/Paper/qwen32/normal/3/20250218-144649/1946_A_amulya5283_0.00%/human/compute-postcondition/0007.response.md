The code snippet `heapq.heapify(heap)` transforms the list `heap` into a heap data structure in-place. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median` remain unchanged. The `heap` variable, which was initially `arr[median_index:]`, is now a heap.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`.**
