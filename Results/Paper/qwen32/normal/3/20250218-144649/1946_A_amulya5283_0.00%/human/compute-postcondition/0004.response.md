The code calculates the `median_index` as `n // 2`. Given that `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, the value of `median_index` is determined by the integer division of `n` by 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, and `median_index` is `n // 2`.**
