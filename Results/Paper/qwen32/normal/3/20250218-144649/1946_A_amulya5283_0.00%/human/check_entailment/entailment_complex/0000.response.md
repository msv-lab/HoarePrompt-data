### Reasoning:

The program is intended to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array by at least 1. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is crucial because the median is defined based on the sorted array.

2. **Identifying the Median**: The median is the middle element in the sorted array. If the length of the array is odd, it is the middle element. If the length is even, it is the lower middle element (since we are using `n // 2`).

3. **Heap Initialization**: A heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This heap is used to efficiently find and modify the smallest element in this part of the array.

4. **Increasing Elements**: The program repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increases it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap. This process continues until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. The number of such operations is counted.

5. **Correctness Analysis**: 
   - The program correctly identifies the median.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find and modify the smallest elements that need to be increased.
   - The program counts the number of operations correctly, which is the number of times an element is incremented to ensure that the median increases.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with one of the examples provided:

**Example:**
Input:
```
3
2 2 8
```
Output:
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The array is `[2, 2, 8]`.
- After sorting, it remains `[2, 2, 8]`.
- The median index is `1`, and the median is `2`.
- The heap is initialized with `[2, 8]`.
- The smallest element `2` is popped, incremented to `3`, and pushed back into the heap.
- The heap now contains `[3, 8]`.
- The smallest element `3` is greater than the current median `2`, so the process stops.
- The number of operations is `1`.

The program correctly computes the result as `1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The use of a heap ensures that the operations are performed efficiently.

**Correctness: **True**
