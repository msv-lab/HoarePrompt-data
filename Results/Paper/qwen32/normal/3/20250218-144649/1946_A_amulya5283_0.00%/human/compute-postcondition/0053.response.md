To ensure the `while` loop can execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. The variables `heap` and `current_median` are key here.

1. **`heap`**: This is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`. Since `heap` is a min-heap, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]`.

2. **`current_median`**: This is the median of the array `arr`.

For the loop to execute, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`. Given that `heap` is a heap of the second half of the sorted array `arr`, and `current_median` is the middle element of `arr`, we need to ensure that the smallest element in the second half of `arr` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

### Analysis:
- If `n` is odd, `current_median` is the middle element of `arr`.
- If `n` is even, `current_median` is the lower of the two middle elements of `arr`.

In either case, for the loop to execute, the smallest element in the second half of `arr` (which is `heap[0]`) must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

### Adjustment:
Since `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the smallest element in the second half of `arr` is either `current_median` or an element smaller than `current_median`. If `n` is odd, `heap[0]` is `current_median` itself, and the condition is trivially satisfied. If `n` is even, `heap[0]` is the next element after `current_median` in the sorted array, and it should be less than or equal to `current_median` for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is already satisfied if `arr` is sorted correctly and `heap` is heapified from `arr[median_index:]`. No additional adjustments are needed to the state of `heap` or `current_median` based on the given information.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, `operations` is 0**
