Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index`.**

In simple terms, the variable `heap` has been transformed into a min-heap, which means the smallest element of the heap is at the root. All other variables remain unchanged.
