Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`. `heap` now includes `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `operations` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables retain their previous values as specified in the initial state.
