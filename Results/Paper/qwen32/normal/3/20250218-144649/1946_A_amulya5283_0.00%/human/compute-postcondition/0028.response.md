The code snippet creates a new list `heap` by slicing `arr` from the `median_index` to the end of the list. This does not affect any of the existing variables except for introducing a new one, `heap`.

Given that `median_index` is `n // 2` and `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `heap` will contain the second half of the sorted list `arr` starting from the median element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`.**

In simpler terms: The variable `heap` has been created and contains the second half of the sorted list `arr` starting from the median element. All other variables retain their previous values.
