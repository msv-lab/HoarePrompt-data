The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The heap is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, which means it's a min-heap of the second half of the sorted list `arr`.

Given the initial state, `heap` is initially `arr[median_index:]`. After the `heappop` operation, the smallest element from this heap is removed and stored in `smallest`. The heap will now contain the remaining elements from `arr[median_index:]` after the smallest one has been removed.

The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median` remain unchanged. The variable `operations` is also unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

The output state will reflect that `smallest` holds the value of the smallest element from the heap, and the heap itself is updated to no longer include this smallest element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed, `operations` is 0, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap.**
