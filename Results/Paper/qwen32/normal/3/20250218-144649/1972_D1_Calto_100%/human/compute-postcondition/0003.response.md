The code snippet assigns the value of `i * i` to the variable `y`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is also not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1, `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`**.

In simpler terms, `y` is now equal to `i * i`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
