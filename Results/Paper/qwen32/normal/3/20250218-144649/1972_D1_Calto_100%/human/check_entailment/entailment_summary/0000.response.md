### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function works correctly based on the provided output hints.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
- The logic inside `func_2` does not directly reflect the problem's requirement. Specifically, it calculates a sum based on the expression `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for each \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
- This expression does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The logic seems to be an incorrect or overly complicated transformation of the original problem.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using a nested loop structure, but given the constraints, optimizations or a different mathematical insight might be necessary to avoid a time complexity that exceeds the limits.

#### Conclusion:
The provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
