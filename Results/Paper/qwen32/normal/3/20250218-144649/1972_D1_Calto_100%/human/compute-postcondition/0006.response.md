The code snippet `x = n - (i * i - i)` updates the value of `x` based on the current values of `n` and `i`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i_prev`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The new value of `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0), `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**
