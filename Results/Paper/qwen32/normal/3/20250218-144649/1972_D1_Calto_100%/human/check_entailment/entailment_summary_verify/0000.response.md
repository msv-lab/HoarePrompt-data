### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and its function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is supposed to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) but uses a formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.

The function summary for `func_2` states:
- It calculates and returns the sum of the expression `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all integer values of `i` from 1 to `m`.

This formula does not match the problem's requirement of checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds.

Here's a simple and correct way to implement the solution, which checks each pair \((a, b)\) directly:
```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_2(n, m):
    return count_valid_pairs(n, m)
```

#### Evaluation:
The provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem description. The formula used in the loop does not relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the original assessment that the correctness is **False** is accurate.

### Final:
Final: **False**
