The variable `x` is assigned the value `n - (i * i - i)`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `cnt` remains `-1`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific value for `x`. However, we can express `x` in terms of `n` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1, `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**.
