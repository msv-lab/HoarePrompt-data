Let's break down the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Program Explanation
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This is correct and matches the standard implementation of the GCD function.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.

### Analysis of `func_2(n, m)`
The function `func_2(n, m)` has the following code:
```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

Let's analyze this function in detail:
- `cnt` is initialized to `-1`. This seems incorrect because we should start counting from `0`.
- The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `m`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y`:
  - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
  - `y = i * i`
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

### Correctness of the Formula
The logic inside the loop does not seem to correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the conditions and the formula used do not match the problem statement.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check for each pair \((a, b)\) if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done with nested loops iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition.

### Conclusion
Given the provided code, it does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
