The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. For the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will be 4. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.

The other variables (`diff`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `A`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted here.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `i` is 4**
