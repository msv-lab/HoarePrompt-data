Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 4, `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`, `i` is 4, `max_diff` is updated to `A[4] - A[3]` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains unchanged. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is equal to the previous value of `max_diff` and `index` is 4. If `diff` is not greater than `max_diff` but is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[4] - A[3]`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**
