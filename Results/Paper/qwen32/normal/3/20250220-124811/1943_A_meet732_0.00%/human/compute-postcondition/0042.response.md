The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `cntl` by 1. Given the initial state, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `cntl[i]` is initially 0. After executing this line, the value at `cntl[i]` will be 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input and must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is 1 and all other `cntl[j]` for `j != i` are 0.**
