Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program does not modify any additional variables. Otherwise, `c` is 0 or the initial value minus the number of times `cntl[j] < 2` was true, and `j` is the final value when the loop breaks.**
