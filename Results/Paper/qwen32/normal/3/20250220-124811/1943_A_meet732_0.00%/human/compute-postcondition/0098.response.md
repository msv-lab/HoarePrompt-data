The value of `c` is decremented by 1. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged as per the initial state description. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `j` is less than or equal to `n`; `c` is decreased by 1 from its previous value.
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `j` is less than or equal to `n`; `c` is decreased by 1 from its previous value.**
