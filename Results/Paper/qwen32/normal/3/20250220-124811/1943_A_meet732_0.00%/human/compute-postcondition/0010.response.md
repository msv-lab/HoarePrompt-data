To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the effect of the loop on the `cntl` list. The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a` and increments `cntl[i]` by 1. This means that by the end of the loop, each index in `cntl` will reflect the number of times its corresponding index appears in the list `a`.

Given that the loop iterates over all elements in `a`, the final state of `cntl` will be such that `cntl[i]` is equal to the count of how many times `i` appears in `a`.

Let's summarize the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a`.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing, `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `n` remains the same as the input integer. The list `a` is unchanged and still represents the input list of integers. The list `cntl` is now a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` indicates how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
