Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `c` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `c` has been decreased by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `cntl`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
