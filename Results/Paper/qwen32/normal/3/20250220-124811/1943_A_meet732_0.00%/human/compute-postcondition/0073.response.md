Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `c` is 0 if the loop terminated because `c` reached 0, or it is the value after the last decrement if the loop terminated because `j` reached `n`, and `j` is the value at which the loop terminated (either the value that made `c` 0 or `n`).**
