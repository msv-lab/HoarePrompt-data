The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the expression `x - k + 3`. If `i` is less than `x - k + 3`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between `k` and 100 (inclusive) and not equal to `k - 1`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `z` is `k - 1`, `i` is 1**
