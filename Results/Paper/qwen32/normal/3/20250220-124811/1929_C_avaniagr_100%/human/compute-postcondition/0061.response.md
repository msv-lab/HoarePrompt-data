Postcondition: **`s` is the next input string from the file, `t` remains unchanged, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the new `s`. The condition `a >= x + 2` is evaluated, but the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain as obtained from splitting `s`, regardless of whether the condition is true or false.**
