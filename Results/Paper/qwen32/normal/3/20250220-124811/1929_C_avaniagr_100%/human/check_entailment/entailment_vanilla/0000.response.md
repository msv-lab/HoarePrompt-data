To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and see if it aligns with the problem description and the provided examples.

### Problem Analysis

The problem boils down to determining whether Sasha can guarantee that he can achieve any number of coins `n` given the rules of the casino and his initial amount of coins `a`.

1. **Winning and Losing Rules**:
    - If Sasha wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
    - If Sasha loses, his coins decrease by `y`.
    - He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

2. **Goal**:
    - Determine if Sasha can always reach any number of coins `n` regardless of the outcome of the bets (as long as he does not lose more than `x` times in a row).

### Strategy Analysis

The key to solving this problem is to understand the relationship between `k`, `x`, and `a`:

1. **If `x < k - 1`**:
    - Sasha can only afford to lose `x` times in a row, which is less than the number of times he needs to win to recover from a single loss (which requires `k - 1` wins to recover the lost coins).
    - The minimum amount of coins needed to guarantee that Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses is `x + 1` (since he can afford to lose `x` times and still have at least 1 coin to bet).

2. **If `x == k - 1`**:
    - Sasha can afford to lose `x` times in a row, which is exactly the number of times he needs to win to recover from a single loss.
    - The minimum amount of coins needed to guarantee that Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses is `x + 2` (since he can afford to lose `x` times and still have at least 2 coins to bet).

3. **If `x > k - 1`**:
    - Sasha can afford to lose more times than he needs to win to recover from a single loss.
    - The minimum amount of coins needed is more complex to calculate but can be approximated by a loop that simulates the process of recovering from consecutive losses.

### Program Analysis

The given program follows the above logic:

1. **For `x < k - 1`**:
    - It checks if `a >= x + 1` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".

2. **For `x == k - 1`**:
    - It checks if `a >= x + 2` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".

3. **For `x > k - 1`**:
    - It uses a loop to calculate the minimum amount of coins needed to recover from `x` consecutive losses and checks if `a` is greater than or equal to this amount.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the rules of the casino and his initial amount of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
