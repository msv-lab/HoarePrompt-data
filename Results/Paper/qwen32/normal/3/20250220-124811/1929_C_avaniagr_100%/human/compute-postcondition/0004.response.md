The given initial state describes the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` as integers derived from a split string `s`. The constraints for these variables are provided, but the specific values are not explicitly given. However, the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of `k`, `x`, or `a`.

The `print('YES')` statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
