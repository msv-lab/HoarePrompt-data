Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values derived from the split string `s`, where `2 ≤ k ≤ 30`, `1 ≤ x ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9`. The number of test cases `t` and any other test cases remain unchanged. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 2` or less than `x + 2`. Otherwise, `a` is an integer and the conditions specified in the else part apply.**

To simplify, the postcondition can be summarized as:
Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers derived from the split string `s` with constraints `2 ≤ k ≤ 30`, `1 ≤ x ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9`. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged. If `x` equals `k - 1`, `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 2` or less than `x + 2`. Otherwise, the conditions in the else part apply to `a`.**
