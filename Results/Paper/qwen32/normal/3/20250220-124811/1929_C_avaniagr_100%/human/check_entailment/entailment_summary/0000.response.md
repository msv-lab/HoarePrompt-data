### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and conditions it uses to decide whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the rules of the casino.

The program's logic can be broken down into three main cases based on the relationship between `x` and `k`:

1. **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can only guarantee to win if he has at least `x + 1` coins initially. This is because he can afford to lose `x` times in a row and still have enough coins to place the next bet.
   - The program checks if `a >= x + 1` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".

2. **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs to have at least `x + 2` coins initially. This is because he can afford to lose `x` times in a row and still have enough coins to place the next bet, but he needs an extra coin to ensure he can place the first bet after a loss.
   - The program checks if `a >= x + 2` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".

3. **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
   - If `x > k - 1`, the logic becomes more complex. The program calculates a threshold `z` that represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs initially to ensure he can place bets indefinitely without running out of money.
   - The threshold `z` is calculated iteratively by starting with `z = k - 2` and then incrementing it based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` times.
   - The program checks if `a >= z` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".

The program's logic appears to correctly implement the conditions described in the problem statement for each case. It correctly handles the different scenarios based on the relationship between `x` and `k`.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program seems to correctly determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the input parameters. The logic aligns with the problem's requirements, and the execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case and outputs the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
