Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the input string `s`. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, then `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their values. Otherwise, `k` is set to 5, `x` is set to 10, `a` remains unchanged, and `z` is set to 32. Additionally, if `a` is greater than or equal to 32, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.**
