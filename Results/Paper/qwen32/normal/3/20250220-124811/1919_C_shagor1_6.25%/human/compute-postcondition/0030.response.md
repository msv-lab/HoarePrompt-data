The code increments the variable `ans` by 1. The values of `a` and `y` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the next element in the list `inp`; `y` is the next element in the list `inp`; `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is the next element in the list `inp`; `y` is the next element in the list `inp`; `ans` is increased by 1.**
