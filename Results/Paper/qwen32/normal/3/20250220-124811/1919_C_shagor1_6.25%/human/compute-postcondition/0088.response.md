The value of `x` is assigned the value of `a`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `iterations` must be one more than the number of completed iterations, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the next element in `inp`, and `x` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`iterations` must be one more than the number of completed iterations, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` is equal to `a`**.
