The code snippet `y = a` assigns the value of `a` to `y`. Given that `a` is greater than `y` initially, `y` will now hold the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, `ans` is 0, and `a` is greater than `y`.**
