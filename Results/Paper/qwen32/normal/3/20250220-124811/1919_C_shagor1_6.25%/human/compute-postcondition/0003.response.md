The code assigns the value `n + 1` to both `x` and `y`. Therefore, the values of `x` and `y` are now `n + 1`. The other variables `t` and `inp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `n + 1`.**
