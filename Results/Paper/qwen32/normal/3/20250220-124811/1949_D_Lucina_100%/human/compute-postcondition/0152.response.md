Output State: **`nx` is a string containing the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**

Explanation: The variable `nx`, which was initially an empty string, now contains the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?' still holds.
