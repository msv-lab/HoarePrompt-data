Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` plus any indices from `1` to `n` where both `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `t` is the length of `sa` before any potential appending of `i`, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` plus any indices from `1` to `n` where both `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `t` is the length of `sa` before any potential appending of `i`. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` is not a '?', then `nx` is the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]`. Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, `nx` is 'F'; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` plus any indices from `1` to `n` where both `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `t` is the length of `sa` before any potential appending of `i`, `j` is 2. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` is not a '?', `nx` is the previous value of `nx` concatenated with the character at position 1 in the string `xx[1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` with 'F' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` with 'S' appended to it.`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` plus any indices from `1` to `n` where both `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `t` is the length of `sa` before any potential appending of `i`, `j` is 3. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` is not a '?', `nx` is the original value of `nx` concatenated with the character at position 2 in the string `xx[i]`. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` is a '?', and if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` with 'F' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` has 'S' appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
