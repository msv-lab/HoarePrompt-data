To determine what will be printed, we need to understand how the string `nx` is constructed based on the given rules. 

Here are the key points from the initial state:
- `nx` is a string of length `n`.
- Each character in `nx` is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[i]`:
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx[j - 1]` is `xx[i][j - 1]`.
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx[j - 1]` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx[j - 1]` is 'S'.

Since the exact values of `xx`, `sa`, `n`, and `i` are not provided, we will describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Length of `nx`**: `nx` is a string of length `n`.
2. **Character Construction**:
   - For each position `j` in `nx` (where `j` ranges from 1 to `n`):
     - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx[j - 1]` is `xx[i][j - 1]`.
     - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?':
       - Check if `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.
       - If either condition is true, `nx[j - 1]` is 'F'.
       - Otherwise, `nx[j - 1]` is 'S'.

### Output Description:
Given the above rules, the output `nx` will be constructed based on the values of `xx[i]`, `sa`, `n`, and `i`. Since specific values are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **nx (where each character is determined by the rules: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx[j - 1]` is `xx[i][j - 1]`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx[j - 1]` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx[j - 1]` is 'S')**
