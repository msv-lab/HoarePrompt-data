Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n+1` is the total number of 'F' characters in all input strings up to the `i-1` position, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n+1` is the total number of 'S' characters in all input strings up to the `i-1` position, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is `n+1`, `sa` is an empty list.**

In natural language: The variable `sa` has been initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.
