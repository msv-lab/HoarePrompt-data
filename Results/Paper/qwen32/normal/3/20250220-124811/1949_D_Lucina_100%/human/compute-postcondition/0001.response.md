Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is assigned from the input. A new list `a` is created with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. The initial state of `n` and the symmetric matrix input remain unchanged.
