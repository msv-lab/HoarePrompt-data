Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `i` is 1, and `x` is the input string. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', then `a[1]` is set to 2 and all other elements of `a` and `b` are 0. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` is set to 2 and all other elements of `a` and `b` are 0. Otherwise, all elements of `a` and `b` are 0.**
