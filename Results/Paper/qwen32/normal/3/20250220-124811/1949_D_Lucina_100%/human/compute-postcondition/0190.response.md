Postcondition: **`nx` is a string, and `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`. `sa` is a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.**
