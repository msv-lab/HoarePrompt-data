The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the current value of `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` is determined based on certain conditions, but after the operation, `nx` will have the character 'S' appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` plus any indices from `1` to `n` where both `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `t` is the length of `sa` before any potential appending of `i`. `j` is 2. `nx` is the original value of `nx` with 'S' appended to it.**
