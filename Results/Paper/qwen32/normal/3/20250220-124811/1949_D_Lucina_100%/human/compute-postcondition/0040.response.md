The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `b[2]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the total number of 'F' characters in `x` and `a[j]` is the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to position `j` in `x`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[1]` is the total number of 'S' characters in `x` and `b[2]` is the cumulative number of 'S' characters up to position 2 in `x` increased by 1, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the input string `x`, `i` is 2, and `x` is the new input string. Additionally, `x[j - 1]` is equal to 'S'.**
