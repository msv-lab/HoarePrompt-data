The provided code snippet is `xx.append(x)`. This means that the string `x` will be appended to the list `xx`. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged as per the initial state and the description provided.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state will be:

Output State: **`a[1]` is the total number of 'F' characters in `x`; `a[j]` for `j` from 2 to `n+1` is the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to position `j-1` in `x`; `b[1]` is the total number of 'S' characters in `x`; `b[j]` for `j` from 2 to `n+1` is the cumulative number of 'S' characters up to position `j-1` in `x`; `xx` now includes `x` as its last element; `i` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the list `xx` now contains the string `x` as its last element, while the arrays `a` and `b`, and the variable `i` remain unchanged.
