The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `i` is 1, and `x` is the input string. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', then `a[1]` is 3, `a[j]` is 4, and all other elements of `a` and `b` are 0. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` is 4, and all other elements of `a` and `b` are 0. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then all elements of `a` and `b` are 0 except `b[1]` which is 2, and `j` is 2. `j` is 2**
