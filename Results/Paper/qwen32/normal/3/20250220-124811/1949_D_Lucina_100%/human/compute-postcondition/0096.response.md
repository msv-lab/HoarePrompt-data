The code appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`. Given that `i` is 1, `sb` will now contain the single element `[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is [1]**.
