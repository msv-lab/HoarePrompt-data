You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. Each character in the i-th line and j-th column is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', where '.' occurs only when i = j, 'F' and 'S' denote pre-decided funny and scary transition videos respectively, and '?' denotes an undecided transition video. It is guaranteed that the input matrix is symmetric (i.e., the character at position (i, j) is the same as the character at position (j, i)) and there are at most floor(n/2) pre-decided transition videos ('F' or 'S').

If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for any `i` from 1 to `n`, then those indices are appended to `sb`. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.

        #State: After all iterations, `nx` will be a string constructed for each `xx[i]` from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each `xx[i]`, `nx` will be formed by iterating over each character in `xx[i]` and replacing '?' characters with 'S' or 'F' based on the conditions involving `sb`. The variable `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes, and `j` will be `n + 1` at the end of the last iteration. The lists `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb` will remain unchanged as per the precondition.
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is `n+1`, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, a sequence of `n + 1` strings, where each string `nx` is of length `n`, is constructed by iterating through each character position `j` from `1` to `n` in the string `xx[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n + 1`. Each character in `nx` is determined by the rules: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, then `nx[j - 1]` is `xx[i][j - 1]`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, then `nx[j - 1]` is `'F'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, it is `'S'`. Otherwise, after all iterations, `nx` will be a string constructed for each `xx[i]` from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each `xx[i]`, `nx` will be formed by iterating over each character in `xx[i]` and replacing '?' characters with 'S' or 'F' based on the conditions involving `sb`. The variable `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes, and `j` will be `n + 1` at the end of the last iteration. The lists `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb` will remain unchanged as per the precondition.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a symmetric matrix of size `n x n` where each element is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', with '.' only on the diagonal. The function returns a configuration of the matrix where '?' characters are replaced with 'F' or 'S' such that there are at most floor(n/2) pre-decided transition videos ('F' or 'S') in the matrix.
