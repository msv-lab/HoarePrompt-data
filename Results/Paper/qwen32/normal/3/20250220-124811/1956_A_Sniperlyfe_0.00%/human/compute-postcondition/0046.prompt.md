Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `t` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = []
    for n in qs:
        res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is a list containing `len(qs)` elements, each being the output of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least the number of integers equal to the total iterations of the loop, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are integers in `qs`, where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
