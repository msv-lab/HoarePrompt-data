The code appends the result of the function `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value being appended to `res`. However, we know that `res` was initially an empty list and now contains one element, which is the output of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, `p` is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the user input and must have at least one element, `res` is a list containing one element, which is the output of `func_1(n, p)`**.
