To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `n` in the list `qs`.
- For each iteration, it appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`.
- The loop continues until all elements in `qs` have been processed.
- The variables `k`, `q`, `t`, and `p` remain unchanged throughout the loop iterations.

### Final Output State:
- `k` remains the first input integer.
- `q` remains the second input integer.
- `qs` remains the list of integers obtained from the input.
- `res` will contain the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.
- `t` remains `x-1`.
- `p` remains the new list of integers obtained from the input.

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop has finished executing all iterations, the variable `res` will contain the results of applying the function `func_1` to each element of the list `qs`. The other variables (`k`, `q`, `t`, and `p`) will retain their initial values.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.**
