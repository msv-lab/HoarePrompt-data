Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is an empty list, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
for n in qs:
    res.append(func_1(n, p))
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `res` contains one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the first element of `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `res` contains two elements where the first is the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the second is the result of `func_1(n, p)` again, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the second element of `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least three elements, `res` contains three elements where the first is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the second is the result of `func_1(n, p)` again, and the third is the result of `func_1(n, p)` again, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the third element of `qs`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
