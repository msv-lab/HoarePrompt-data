### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and see if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

#### Function `func_1(n, p)`:
- **Purpose**: To determine the number of players remaining after all possible rounds of kicking out players as described by the sequence `p`.
- **Logic**:
  - The function enters a loop that continues as long as `n` (the number of players) is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `p`.
  - Inside the loop, it calculates the number of players to be kicked out in the current round by summing up `1` for each position in `p` that is less than or equal to `n`.
  - It then subtracts this sum from `n`.
  - The loop continues until `n` is smaller than the smallest element in `p`, meaning no more players can be kicked out.
  - Finally, it returns `n`, which represents the number of remaining players.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases as described in the input format.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of player counts `qs`.
  - It then iterates over each player count `n` in `qs`, calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of winners for that player count, and appends the result to the list `res`.
  - It prints the results for each test case after processing all player counts for that test case.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic of the game by iteratively removing players based on the positions specified in `p` until no more players can be removed.
- The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results in the required format.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement:

**First Test Case:**
- `k = 2`, `q = 1`, `p = [3, 5]`, `qs = [5]`
- `func_1(5, [3, 5])`:
  - Round 1: `n = 5`, kick out players at positions 3 and 5, `n = 5 - 2 = 3`
  - Round 2: `n = 3`, kick out player at position 3, `n = 3 - 1 = 2`
  - Round 3: `n = 2`, no players to kick out, return `n = 2`
- Output: `2`

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
