Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not follow the problem description correctly, particularly in how it handles the output for each test case. The output for each test case should be a line with `q` integers separated by spaces, but the current implementation prints the results incrementally, which would lead to incorrect formatting.

Here is a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Input:
```
1
2 3
3 5
1 3 5
```

### Expected Output:
```
1 1 1
```

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
1
1 1
1 1 1
```

The program prints the results after processing each `n_i` in the `qs` list, which results in multiple lines instead of a single line for each test case.

To fix this, the program should accumulate the results for each `n_i` in the `qs` list and print them all at once after processing all `n_i` values for a given test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

# Call the function to process input and print output
func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the results for each test case are printed on a single line, as required by the problem description.
