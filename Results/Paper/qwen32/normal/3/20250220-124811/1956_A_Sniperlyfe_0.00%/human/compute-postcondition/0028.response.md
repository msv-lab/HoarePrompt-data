The code snippet appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, `res` initially contains two elements, and after the execution of the code, `res` will contain three elements. The first element of `res` remains unchanged, the second element remains the result of `func_1(n, p)` called previously, and the third element is the new result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 3 integers, `res` is a list containing three elements where the third element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the next integer in `qs`.**
