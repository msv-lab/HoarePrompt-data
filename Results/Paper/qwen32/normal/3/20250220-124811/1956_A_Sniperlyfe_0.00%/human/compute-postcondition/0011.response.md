To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is the next element in the list `qs`. Since `qs` is a list of integers obtained from user input and must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of `qs`.
2. **`p`**: This is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round.
3. **`t`**: This is an integer greater than 0.
4. **`k` and `q`**: These are integers obtained from the input.
5. **`qs`**: This is a list of integers obtained from user input and must have at least one element.
6. **`res`**: This is a list containing two elements, both of which are the output of the function `func_1(n, p)`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```
This line of code converts each element in the list `res` to a string and then joins them with a space in between.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`res`**: As mentioned, `res` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the output of `func_1(n, p)`.
2. **`func_1(n, p)`**: The exact behavior of `func_1` is not provided, so we can't determine the exact numerical values it returns. However, we know that it takes `n` and `p` as arguments and returns something.
3. **`map(str, res)`**: This converts each element of `res` to a string.
4. **`' '.join(...)`**: This joins the string representations of the elements in `res` with a space in between.

### Output:
Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`. However, we can describe the output format.

Output: **[func_1_output_1] [func_1_output_2] (where func_1_output_1 and func_1_output_2 are the outputs of func_1(n, p))**
