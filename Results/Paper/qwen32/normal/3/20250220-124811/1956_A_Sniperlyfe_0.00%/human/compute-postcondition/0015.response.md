To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze how the loop progresses and what it does with each iteration.

The loop iterates over each element in the list `qs`. For each element `n` in `qs`, it appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The loop will execute as many times as there are elements in `qs`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that after all iterations, `res` will contain the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.

Let's denote the length of `qs` as `len(qs)`. After all iterations, `res` will be a list of length `len(qs)`, with each element being the output of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.

Therefore, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`res` is a list containing `len(qs)` elements, each being the output of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, `res` will be a list with as many elements as there are in `qs`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with the corresponding element from `qs` and the list `p`.
