To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the line `res.append(func_1(n, p))` on the existing variables. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot compute its exact return value. However, we do know that the result of `func_1(n, p)` will be appended to the `res` list.

Given the initial state, `res` is an empty list. After executing `res.append(func_1(n, p))`, `res` will contain one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

The variables `qs`, `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
