To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables from Input:**
   - `k`: First input integer.
   - `q`: Second input integer.
   - `qs`: A list of integers obtained from the input, with at least three elements.
   - `p`: A new list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `n`: The third element of the list `qs`.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - `res`: A list containing three elements, each of which is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `t`: This is defined as `x-1`, but `x` is not mentioned in the provided initial state, so we can ignore `t` for the purpose of this task.

3. **Function:**
   - `func_1(n, p)`: This function is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `res`. However, we know that each element in `res` is the result of calling `func_1(n, p)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement joins the elements of the list `res` into a single string, with each element separated by a space.
- Since `res` contains three elements, each of which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the output will be a string with three values separated by spaces.

### Output Description:
- The output will be the string representation of the three elements in `res`, separated by spaces.
- The exact values of these elements depend on the implementation of `func_1(n, p)`, which is not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's results.

### Final Output:
Output: **result_of_func_1(n, p) result_of_func_1(n, p) result_of_func_1(n, p) (where each result_of_func_1(n, p) is the result of calling func_1 with n as the third element of qs and p as the list of integers obtained from the input)**
