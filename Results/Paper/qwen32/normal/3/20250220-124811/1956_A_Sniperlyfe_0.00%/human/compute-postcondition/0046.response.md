To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables. Given that the loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, it processes a set of queries (`qs`), we can infer the following:

1. **k and q**: These variables are read from the input at the start of each iteration but are not modified within the loop body. Thus, their final state will be the values they had in the last iteration.
2. **p**: This list is also read from the input at the start of each iteration. Since there is no indication that `p` is modified within the loop body, its final state will be the value it had in the last iteration.
3. **qs**: This list is read from the input at the start of each iteration. Since the loop processes `qs` and prints the results, the final `qs` will be the one from the last iteration.
4. **res**: This list accumulates the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` of the current iteration. After all iterations, `res` will contain the accumulated results from all iterations.

Since the problem asks for the state after all iterations, the final `res` will be the concatenation of results from all iterations. However, the problem statement does not specify how to accumulate results across iterations, so we assume that `res` is reset in each iteration.

The final output state will reflect the state of variables after the last iteration of the loop. Here is the final output state:

Output State: **`k` is the first input integer of the last iteration, `q` is the second input integer of the last iteration, `p` is the list of integers from the input of the last iteration, `qs` is the list of integers from the input of the last iteration, `res` is the list of results from `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` of the last iteration, `t` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the final output state will reflect the values from the last iteration of the loop, with `res` containing the results from that iteration and `t` being 0 since the loop has finished executing.
