The code snippet `res = []` reassigns the variable `res` to an empty list. This means that the previous list `res` (which contained `len(qs)` elements, each being the output of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`) is discarded, and `res` is now an empty list. The other variables (`qs`, `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is an empty list; `t` remains unchanged; `k` is the first input integer; `q` is the second input integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
