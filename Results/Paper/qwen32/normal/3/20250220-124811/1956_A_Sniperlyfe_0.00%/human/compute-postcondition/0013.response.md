The code snippet appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Initially, `res` contains two elements, each being the output of `func_1(n, p)`. After the execution of the code, `res` will have three elements, with the third element also being the output of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`n` is the next element in the list `qs` after the current one, `p` is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the user input and must have at least one element, `res` is a list containing three elements, each being the output of `func_1(n, p)`**.
