The code snippet `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then maps each string to an integer, storing the result in the variable `p`. This means that the value of `p` will change based on the input provided, but the values of `res`, `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing `len(qs)` elements, each being the output of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`; `t` remains unchanged; `k` is the first input integer; `q` is the second input integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
