The code snippet `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `p` to the list `res`. 

Given the initial state:
- `k` is the first input integer.
- `q` is the second input integer.
- `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements.
- `res` contains one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `t` is `x-1`.
- `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `n` is the second element of `qs`.

After executing the code, `res` will have an additional element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `res` contains two elements where the first is the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the second is the result of `func_1(n, p)` again, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the second element of `qs`.**
