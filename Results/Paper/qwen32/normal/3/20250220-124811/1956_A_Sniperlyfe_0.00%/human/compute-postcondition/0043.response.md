The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The variables `k`, `q`, `qs`, `t`, and `p` remain unchanged. The variable `res` now contains three elements: the first and second elements are the results of `func_1(n, p)` from the initial state, and the third element is the new result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least three elements, `res` contains three elements where the first is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the second is the result of `func_1(n, p)` again, and the third is the result of `func_1(n, p)` again, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the third element of `qs`.**
