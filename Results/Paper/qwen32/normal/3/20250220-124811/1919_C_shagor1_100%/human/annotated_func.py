#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the provided integers and list.
