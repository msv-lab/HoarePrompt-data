### Reasoning:

The provided program contains a binary search to determine the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the profit for a given `k` or determine whether it is optimal. Instead, it calculates a value that is not directly related to the profit and checks if it is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This condition does not help in finding the maximum profit.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the profit for each possible value of `k` and determine the maximum profit. The profit for selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Profit}(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) + (n - k) \times a \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ \text{Profit}(k) = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

We need to find the value of `k` that maximizes this profit.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it uses a binary search to find the maximum `k` for which a condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` holds, which is not related to the profit calculation.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
