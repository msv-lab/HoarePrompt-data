Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown

Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price of `(b - i + 1)` for the `i-th` bun, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`. We need to find the optimal `k` to maximize the profit.

### Program Analysis

The given program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are read.

2. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - `low` is initialized to 0.
   - `high` is initialized to `n`.
   - `ans` is initialized to -1, which will store the optimal `k`.

3. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - The binary search loop runs as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - The function `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` is called to check if selling `mid` buns at the modified price is valid.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function calculates the total price if `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price.
   - The condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` is checked. However, this condition does not correctly determine the maximum profit; it merely checks whether the total price is less than or equal to the product of `n` and the maximum of `a` and `b`.
   - The function should instead calculate the total profit for a given `k` and compare it with the profit for other values of `k` to find the maximum.

### Correctness Evaluation

The program's logic for determining the optimal `k` is flawed because:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the profit for a given `k`.
- The binary search is not used to find the maximum profit but instead checks an incorrect condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Compute the profit for each possible `k` from 0 to `n`.
- The profit for a given `k` can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{profit}(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) + (n - k) \cdot a
  \]
- Find the maximum profit among all possible values of `k`.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
