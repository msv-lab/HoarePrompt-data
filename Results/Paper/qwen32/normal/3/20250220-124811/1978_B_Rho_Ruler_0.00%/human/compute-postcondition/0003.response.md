Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, we need to calculate the output state.

Initial State: 
- `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers with specific constraints.
- `ans` is calculated as `k * b + (n - k) * a`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```
return ans <= n * max(a, b)
```

Let's evaluate the expression `ans <= n * max(a, b)`:

1. `ans` is defined as `k * b + (n - k) * a`.
2. `max(a, b)` will be either `a` or `b`, whichever is larger.
3. The expression `n * max(a, b)` will be `n * a` if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise `n * b`.

We need to compare `ans` with `n * max(a, b)`.

Since `ans` is a weighted sum of `a` and `b` with weights `n-k` and `k` respectively, and `max(a, b)` is the larger of the two, the expression `ans <= n * max(a, b)` will always be true because the maximum possible value for `ans` would be when all weights are assigned to the larger number, which is exactly `n * max(a, b)`.

Therefore, the expression will always evaluate to `True`.

Output State: **The program returns True**.
