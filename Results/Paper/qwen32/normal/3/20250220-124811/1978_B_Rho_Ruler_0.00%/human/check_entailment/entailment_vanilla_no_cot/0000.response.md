Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined and used in the binary search to find the optimal `k`. The function `func_1` currently checks if the total revenue from selling `k` buns at the modified price and `(n - k)` buns at the usual price is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct condition for maximizing profit.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the revenue for each possible `k` and find the maximum revenue. The revenue for a given `k` can be calculated as the sum of the series `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from 1 to `k`, plus `a * (n - k)` for the remaining buns. The correct approach is to iterate over possible values of `k` and compute the revenue, or use a more efficient method to find the optimal `k`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_profit(n, a, b):
    # Calculate the maximum profit
    max_profit = 0
    for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
        # Calculate the revenue for this k
        revenue = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, k + 1)) + a * (n - k)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, revenue)
    return max_profit

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max_profit(n, a, b))
```

This program iterates over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and calculates the total revenue for each `k`. It keeps track of the maximum revenue found, which is the answer. This approach is efficient given the constraints.
