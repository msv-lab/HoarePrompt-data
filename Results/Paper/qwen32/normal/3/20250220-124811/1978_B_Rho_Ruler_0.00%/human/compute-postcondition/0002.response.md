The code snippet `ans += (n - k) * a` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `(n - k) * a` to it. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially `k * b`. After the execution of the code, `ans` will be `k * b + (n - k) * a`.

Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `ans` is `k * b + (n - k) * a`.**
