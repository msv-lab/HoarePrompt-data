The code snippet `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. This means that `results` will now include the final value of `count` after all iterations. The other variables (`test_cases`, `freq`, and `count`) remain unchanged except that `results` is updated to include the new value.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` after all iterations and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary with keys as `(a % x, a % y)` and values as the number of times each pair appears in `arr`; `count` is the final sum of all values in `freq` that were added to it during the loop.**
