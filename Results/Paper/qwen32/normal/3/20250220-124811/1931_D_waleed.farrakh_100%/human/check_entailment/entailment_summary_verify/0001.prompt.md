You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, two favorite integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It processes these test cases using another function `func_1` and prints the results for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Breakdown

The task is to find the number of pairs \((i, j)\) in the array such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Mathematical Insight

For a pair \((i, j)\) to be beautiful:
1. \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) which implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\) or equivalently \(a_i \equiv (x - a_j) \pmod{x}\).
2. \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) which implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

Thus, for a pair \((i, j)\) to be beautiful:
- \(a_i \equiv (x - a_j) \pmod{x}\)
- \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\)

### Program Analysis

The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs of remainders \((rx, ry)\) where:
- \(rx = (-a_i \mod x + x) \mod x\) ensures that \(rx\) is always non-negative.
- \(ry = a_i \mod y\).

For each element in the array, it checks if the pair \((rx, ry)\) has been seen before. If it has, it adds the count of such pairs to the result. It then updates the frequency of the current pair \((a_i \mod x, a_i \mod y)\).

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the correctness of the program:
- The program correctly computes the required remainders for each element.
- It uses a dictionary to efficiently count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
- The logic to check and update the count of pairs is sound.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
