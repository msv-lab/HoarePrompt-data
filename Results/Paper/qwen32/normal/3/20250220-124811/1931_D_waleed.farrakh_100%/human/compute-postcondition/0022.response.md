The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. 

To ensure the loop executes, `results` must have at least one element. The other variables (`test_cases`, `data`, `t`, `idx`) are not directly part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is `2 * t + 1`, and `results` is a list containing at least one element**
