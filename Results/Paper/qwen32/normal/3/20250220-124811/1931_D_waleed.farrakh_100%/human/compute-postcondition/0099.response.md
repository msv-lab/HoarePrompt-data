Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, with the first tuple removed from the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` was already in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1 and `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[(rx, ry)]`. If `current_pair` was not in `freq`, it is added with the value `1`. `arr` must have at least one element; `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`.**
