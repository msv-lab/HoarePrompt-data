The code snippet provided maps the elements of the string `data[idx + 1]` split by spaces to integers and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. Here's the updated state:

- `test_cases` remains an empty list.
- `data` remains a list of strings with at least one element.
- `t` remains an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0.
- `idx` remains 1.
- `n` remains the first integer from `data[1]` split by spaces.
- `x` remains the second integer from `data[1]` split by spaces.
- `y` remains the third integer from `data[1]` split by spaces.
- `arr` is now a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` by spaces and converting each element to an integer.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 1, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[idx + 1]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**
