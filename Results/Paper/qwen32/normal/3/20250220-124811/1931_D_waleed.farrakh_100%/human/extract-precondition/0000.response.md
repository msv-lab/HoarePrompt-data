Precondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x (an integer representing Polycarp's first favorite integer), y (an integer representing Polycarp's second favorite integer), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array). It is guaranteed that for each tuple, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in arr.**
