The provided code snippet reassigns the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` using the integers from `data[idx].split()`. Given the initial state, `idx` is 3, so `data[3]` is the string to be split into integers.

Let's determine the new values of `n`, `x`, and `y`:
- `data[3]` is a string that contains three space-separated integers.
- These integers are mapped to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively.

Since the initial state specifies that `n`, `x`, and `y` are already defined from `data[1]`, the new assignment from `data[3]` will override these values.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0]) - 1` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `n` is the first integer from `data[3]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from `data[3]` split by spaces, `y` is the third integer from `data[3]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[idx + 1]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**

In simpler terms, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are now the first, second, and third integers from `data[3]` respectively, while all other variables remain unchanged.
