You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, two favorite integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It processes these test cases using another function `func_1` and prints the results for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Polycarp considers a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n) beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The task is to find the number of such beautiful pairs in the array \(a\).

### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function takes a list of test cases and calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
2. `func_2`: This function reads input from standard input, processes it to extract test cases, and then calls `func_1` to compute the results.

Let's focus on `func_1` as it performs the core logic for counting beautiful pairs:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        freq = {}
        count = 0
        for a in arr:
            rx = (-a % x + x) % x
            ry = a % y
            if (rx, ry) in freq:
                count += freq[rx, ry]
            current_pair = (a % x, a % y)
            if current_pair in freq:
                freq[current_pair] += 1
            else:
                freq[current_pair] = 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Logic for Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The code uses the modulo operation to determine the remainders of \(a_i\) when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each element \(a\), it calculates `rx` as \((-a \% x + x) \% x\), which is equivalent to finding the complement of \(a \% x\) modulo \(x\). This is because we need \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) or \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
   - It then calculates `ry` as \(a \% y\), which is directly used to check the second condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\).

2. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` keeps track of the pairs \((a \% x, a \% y)\) encountered so far.
   - For each element \(a\), it checks if the pair \((rx, ry)\) exists in `freq`. If it does, it increments the count by the frequency of that pair, as each occurrence of such a pair forms a beautiful pair with the current element.

3. **Updating Frequency**:
   - After checking for beautiful pairs, the current element's pair \((a \% x, a \% y)\) is added to the frequency dictionary.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array**: Not possible as \(n \geq 2\).
- **All Elements Same**: The code correctly handles this case as it relies on the modulo operation, which will be consistent for all elements.
- **No Beautiful Pairs**: The code correctly returns 0 if no beautiful pairs are found.
- **Large Values**: The code uses modulo operations, which are efficient and handle large values well.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the provided code, it appears to correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases appropriately and efficiently.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly uses modulo operations to determine the remainders and checks for beautiful pairs by leveraging a frequency dictionary. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
