Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `(rx, ry)` is a key in `freq`, then `count` is set to `freq[rx, ry]`. If `(rx, ry)` is not a key in `freq`, then `count` remains unchanged. `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`.**
