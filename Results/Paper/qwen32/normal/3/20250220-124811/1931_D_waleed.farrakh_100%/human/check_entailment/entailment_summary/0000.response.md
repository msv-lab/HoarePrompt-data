### Reasoning:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a detailed explanation of how they work and how they relate to the problem description:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from standard input.
   - It parses the input to extract the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It collects all test cases in a list called `test_cases`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with this list of test cases.
   - Finally, it prints the results returned by `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` as the remainder of `-a` modulo `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - It calculates `ry` as the remainder of `a` modulo `y`.
     - If the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in `freq`, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - It calculates the pair `(a % x, a % y)` and updates the frequency of this pair in `freq`.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list containing the counts for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Description:
- **Input Parsing**: `func_2` correctly parses the input and organizes it into test cases.
- **Logic for Beautiful Pairs**: `func_1` correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs:
  - It uses the remainders of elements modulo `x` and `y` to determine if a pair is beautiful.
  - It efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs using a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders.
- **Output**: `func_2` correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. It handles the input parsing, logic, and output generation as required by the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
