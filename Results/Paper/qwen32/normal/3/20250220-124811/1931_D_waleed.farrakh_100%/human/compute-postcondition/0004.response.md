The variable `idx` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `test_cases`, `data`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `test_cases` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, and `idx` is `1`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is `1`**.
