### Reasoning:
Let's break down the program and the provided functions to understand if they correctly solve the problem.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a tree with `n` nodes.
   - The game starts with a stone on a specific node.
   - Players alternate moves, moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - We need to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the distances from a given starting node to all other reachable nodes in the tree.
   - It does this recursively by exploring each child node that is not the parent.
   - For each child node, it calculates the distances and adds 1 to each distance (since the move from parent to child is one step).
   - If the starting node is a leaf (only connected to its parent), it returns `[0]` because there are no further moves from a leaf node.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input to construct the tree and identifies the leaf nodes.
   - It then reads the starting node for the game.
   - It calls `func_1` to get all possible distances from the starting node.
   - It checks if any of these distances are odd. If there is at least one odd distance, Ron wins because he can force a win by making moves that lead to an odd number of moves remaining for Hermione. If all distances are even, Hermione wins because Ron will always be forced to make the last move.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the parity (odd/even) of the distances.
- The game's outcome is correctly determined by checking if there are any odd distances from the starting node.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly solve the problem as described. The output is correctly determined based on the optimal play of both players.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
