The code snippet `leaves.append(key)` adds the current `key` to the `leaves` deque. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Since the initial state specifies that `leaves` is a deque and `key` is a key from the `nodes` dictionary, after executing the code, `leaves` will contain this `key` as its last element. All other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the number of nodes; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `i` is n - 1; `leaves` is a deque containing the `key`.**
