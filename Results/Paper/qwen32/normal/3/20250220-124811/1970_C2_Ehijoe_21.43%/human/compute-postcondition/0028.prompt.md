Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where each key (node) has a list of its neighbors as determined by the `n - 1` edges read from the input; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the number of nodes; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `i` is n - 1; `leaves` is a deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the number of nodes; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `i` is n - 1; `leaves` is a deque. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, then `leaves` contains the `key`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the number of nodes; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `i` is n - 1; `leaves` is a deque. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, then `leaves` contains the `key` as an additional element. Otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the number of nodes; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `i` is n - 1; `leaves` is a deque. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, then `leaves` contains the `key` as an additional element. Otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged; `key` is the next key in the `nodes` dictionary.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
