To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Game Setup**: 
   - A tree with `n` nodes.
   - A stone starts on a specific node.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the winner if both players play optimally.
   - The winner is determined by the parity of the maximum distance from the starting node to any leaf node in the tree.

### Key Concepts:
- **Leaf Nodes**: Nodes with only one connection (except the root, which might also be a leaf in some definitions).
- **Distance Calculation**: The distance from the starting node to all other nodes (specifically, to all leaf nodes) is calculated.
- **Game Outcome**:
  - If any path from the starting node to a leaf node has an odd length, Ron wins.
  - If all such paths have even lengths, Hermione wins.

### Solution Explanation:
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The tree is represented as an adjacency list using `defaultdict`.

2. **Leaf Identification**:
   - Nodes with only one connection are identified as leaves.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` recursively calculates the distance from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
   - It does this by traversing the tree and collecting distances.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if any of the calculated distances are odd.
   - If at least one distance is odd, Ron wins (`print('Ron')`).
   - Otherwise, Hermione wins (`print('Hermione')`).

### Verification:
- The logic for determining the winner is based on the parity of the distance to the farthest leaf node.
- The recursive function `func_1` correctly calculates all distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
- The check `if any([move % 2 == 1 for move in moves])` correctly determines if there is at least one odd distance.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem's requirements and the provided solution, the program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play by both players.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
