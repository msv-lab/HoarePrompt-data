The code snippet provided initializes an empty list called `edges`. This action does not affect the values of `nodes`, `start`, `n`, or `t`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first integer from the input, `t` is the second integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list.**
