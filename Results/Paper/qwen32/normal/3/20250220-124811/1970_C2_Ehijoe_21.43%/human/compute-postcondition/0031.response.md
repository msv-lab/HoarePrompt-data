To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the line `moves = func_1(nodes, start)`. Since the definition and behavior of `func_1` are not provided, we can only infer that this function takes `nodes` and `start` as arguments and returns some value which is stored in `moves`. 

Given that the function's behavior is unknown, we can only state that `moves` now holds the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, `start` is the integer value from the input, `n` is the number of nodes, `t` is the second integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n - 1, `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that are leaves, `moves` is the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`.**
