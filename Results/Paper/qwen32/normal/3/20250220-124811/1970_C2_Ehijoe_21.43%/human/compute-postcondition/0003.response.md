The given code snippet reassigns `nodes` to a new `defaultdict` of lists. This means that `nodes` is no longer the original dictionary but a new one with the same name. The other variables (`start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` where keys are integers and values are lists; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True.**
