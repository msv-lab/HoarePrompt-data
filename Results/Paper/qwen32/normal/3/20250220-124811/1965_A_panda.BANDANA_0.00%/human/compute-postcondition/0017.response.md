The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'Alice'`, regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `l`, `e`, and `m` defined in the initial state.

Let's break down the initial state for clarity:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`.
- `m` is the length of the list `l`.
- Additional conditions are provided about the presence of the integer `1` in the list `l`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **Alice**
