The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet, and `i` remains uninitialized. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `i` is not yet initialized.**
