Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The current logic only checks if there is a pile with 1 stone and concludes that Bob wins in that case. However, this is not always true. The game's outcome depends on the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes) of the piles. If the Nim-sum is zero at the start, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. The current program does not compute the Nim-sum and thus fails to handle all potential cases correctly.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Alice
```

In this case, the Nim-sum of the piles (2 XOR 2 XOR 2) is 0, so Bob should win. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Alice" because it does not check the Nim-sum.
