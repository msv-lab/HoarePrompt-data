Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `i` is 1; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`; `m` is the length of the list `l`. If 1 is in the list `l`, then `e` includes the integer 1 and `m` is at least 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in the list `l`.**

In simpler terms, regardless of whether 1 is in the list `l` or not, the postcondition remains the same: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `i` is 1, `l` is the list of integers, `e` is the set of unique integers from `l`, and `m` is the length of `l`. If 1 is in `l`, `e` includes 1 and `m` is at least 1; otherwise, 1 is not in `l`.
