Let's analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

The game described is a variant of Nim, specifically the subtraction game where players remove the same number of stones from all non-empty piles. The key to solving this problem is understanding the winning and losing positions in such a game.

### Key Observations:
1. **Winning and Losing Positions**: 
   - A position is a losing position if any move from that position leads to a winning position for the opponent.
   - Conversely, a position is a winning position if there exists at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

2. **Game Analysis**:
   - If there is a pile with exactly 1 stone, the player whose turn it is will be forced to remove 1 stone from all piles. This will leave at least one pile with 0 stones (the one that originally had 1 stone), and the opponent will be able to make a move. Thus, the player to move is in a losing position.
   - If all piles have more than 1 stone, the player whose turn it is can always choose a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. Specifically, they can choose \( k \) to be the size of the smallest pile, which will ensure that all piles have more than 1 stone, forcing the opponent into a position where they might encounter a pile of size 1 on their turn.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of piles and the number of stones in each pile.
- It then checks if there is a pile with exactly 1 stone. If there is, it prints "Bob" (indicating that Bob will win if both play optimally).
- If there are no piles with exactly 1 stone, it prints "Alice" (indicating that Alice will win if both play optimally).

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly identifies the losing position (when there is a pile with exactly 1 stone) and the winning position (when all piles have more than 1 stone).
- Based on the observations above, the program's logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description.

Reasoning: The program correctly identifies the losing and winning positions based on the presence of a pile with exactly 1 stone and the sizes of the piles. It correctly outputs the winner for each test case based on optimal play by both players.
Correctness: **True**
