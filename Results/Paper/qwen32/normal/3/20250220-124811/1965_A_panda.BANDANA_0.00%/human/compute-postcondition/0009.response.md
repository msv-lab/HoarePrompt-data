The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Alice'. The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are directly involved in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `l`, `e`, `m`, or the condition that 1 is not in the list `l`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('Alice')`.
2. This statement explicitly prints the string 'Alice'.
3. The variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `l`, `e`, and `m` are not used in the `print` statement.
4. The condition that 1 is not in the list `l` does not affect the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
