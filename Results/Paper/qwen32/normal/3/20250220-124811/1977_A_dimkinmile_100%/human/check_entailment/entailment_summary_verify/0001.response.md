### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly analyzes the problem and the provided program. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Nikita can add or remove exactly one cube per move.
   - To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be non-negative and even. This is because:
     - If `n - m` is negative, it means `m > n`, which is impossible because Nikita cannot have more cubes than the number of moves he makes.
     - If `n - m` is even and non-negative, it means the number of remove operations can balance out the number of add operations to result in exactly `m` cubes.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `kreker` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`:
     - `n - m >= 0` ensures that `m` is not greater than `n`.
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of add and remove operations is even, allowing Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Verification**:
   - The conditions in `func_1()` are correct and sufficient to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1()`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given problem description.

Final: **True**
