Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. We need to determine if after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

Let's break down the logic required:
1. If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes we can add is `n`. Hence, the answer should be "No".
2. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, we need to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because every addition and removal operation changes the number of cubes by 1, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes changes with each move. To reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes in `n` moves, `n - m` must be even (since adding or removing an even number of cubes will keep the parity consistent).

The provided program correctly captures this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `kreker`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It then checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`. If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that `m` is not greater than `n`. If `m > n`, `n - m` would be negative, and the condition would fail, correctly resulting in "No".

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
