### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately analyzes the problem and the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move.
   - To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be non-negative and even. This is because:
     - Each operation changes the number of cubes by 1.
     - If `m > n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`.
     - If `m <= n`, the difference `n - m` must be even to balance the number of add and remove operations.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `kreker`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Verification of Conditions**:
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that `m` is not greater than `n`, which is necessary because you cannot have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of add and remove operations is even, which is necessary to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code align with the original assessment. They correctly describe the state of the program and the reasoning behind the conditions in `func_1()`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given problem description.

**Final: True**
