### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code, including the annotations.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
2. **Key Points**:
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible because the maximum number of cubes we can have after `n` moves is `n` (by adding one cube in each move).
   - If `m <= n`, it's possible if and only if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) effectively cancels out, and we need an even number of such pairs to reach the exact count `m`.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code is:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

#### Annotations:
- **State before function call**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
- **Inside `func_1`**:
  - `n` and `m` are read from the input.
  - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is checked.
  - If true, "Yes" is printed; otherwise, "No" is printed.
- **State after condition**: The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference is even, and `n - m >= 0` checks if `m` is not greater than `n`.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the provided program is incorrect because the condition `n - m >= 0` should be `n >= m` to correctly handle all cases.

#### Evaluation:
- **Condition Analysis**:
  - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference `n - m` is even.
  - The condition `n - m >= 0` is equivalent to `n >= m`, which ensures that we do not need more cubes than the number of moves.
- **Correctness**:
  - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is indeed correct. It ensures that the difference is even and that `m` is not greater than `n`.
  - There is no need to change `n - m >= 0` to `n >= m` because they are equivalent in this context.

#### Counterexample Consideration:
- The counterexample provided in the original assessment (`1 2 1`) is incorrect for the given code.
  - For `n = 2` and `m = 1`, the condition `(2 - 1) % 2 == 0 and 2 - 1 >= 0` is true, so the output should be "Yes".
  - The provided code correctly outputs "Yes" for this case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate. The provided program correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description and the annotations.

**Final: True**
