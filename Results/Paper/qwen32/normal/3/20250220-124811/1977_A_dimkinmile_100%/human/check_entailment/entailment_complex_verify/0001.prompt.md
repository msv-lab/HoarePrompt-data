You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. If the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even integer, then the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is true. Otherwise, either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input and prints "Yes" if the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even integer, otherwise it prints "No". This process is repeated `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step:

### Problem Analysis
Nikita can perform two types of operations:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

The task is to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after performing `n` moves. 

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
- If `m > n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because even if Nikita adds a cube in every move, he can only add `n` cubes.
- If `m <= n`, the difference `n - m` must be even for it to be possible. This is because each operation (add or remove) changes the number of cubes by 1. To go from 0 cubes to `m` cubes with `n` moves, the number of add operations must be `m` and the number of remove operations must be `n - m`. The total number of operations (`n`) must be the sum of these two, and the difference `n - m` must be even to balance the operations.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases `kreker`. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`. In `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Let's verify if the conditions in `func_1()` correctly determine the possibility of ending up with `m` cubes after `n` moves:
- The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that `m` is not greater than `n` (i.e., it's possible to have at least `m` cubes if we start from 0).
- The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of add and remove operations is even, which is necessary to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Both conditions are correct and sufficient to determine the answer.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given problem description.
