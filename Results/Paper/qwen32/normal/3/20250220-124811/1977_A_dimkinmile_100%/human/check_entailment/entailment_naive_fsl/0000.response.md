Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is not sufficient to determine whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Let's analyze the problem and the code in detail:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes we can have after `n` moves is `n` (by adding one cube in each move).
   - If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, it is possible to have `m` cubes if and only if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) effectively cancels out, and we need an even number of such pairs to reach the exact count `m`.

3. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition should be: `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n >= m`.

4. **Issue in the Provided Code**:
   - The code uses `n - m >= 0`, which is incorrect. It should be `n >= m`.

Let's consider a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Counterexample**:
- Input: `1 2 1`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (Nikita can add one cube and then remove one cube to end up with 1 cube after 2 moves).
- Actual Output: `No` (because `n - m >= 0` is true, but `n - m` is odd).

To fix the code, the condition should be updated to:
```python
if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n >= m:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

Hence, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem description.
