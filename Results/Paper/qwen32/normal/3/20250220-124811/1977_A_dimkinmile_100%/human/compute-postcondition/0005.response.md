Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. If the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even integer, then the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is true. Otherwise, either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`.**
