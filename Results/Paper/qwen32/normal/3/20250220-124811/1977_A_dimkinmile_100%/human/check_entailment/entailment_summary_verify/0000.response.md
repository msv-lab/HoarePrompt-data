Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program, using the function summary and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes one cube.

### Key Observations

1. **Maximum Cubes**: After `n` moves, the maximum number of cubes that can be on the tower is `n` (if all moves are additions).
2. **Minimum Cubes**: The minimum number of cubes that can be on the tower is `0` (if all moves are removals, and the tower starts empty).
3. **Parity of Moves**: To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each addition and removal pair (which is two moves) results in no net change in the number of cubes. Therefore, to achieve an exact number of cubes, the number of unmatched moves (which would be the difference `n - m`) must be even.

### Correct Condition

The correct condition to determine if it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves is:
- `n >= m` (to ensure we can have at least `m` cubes, since we can't remove more cubes than we add)
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (to ensure the difference in moves is even, allowing us to achieve exactly `m` cubes)

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`. The issue with this condition is that `n - m >= 0` is not sufficient. It should be `n >= m`.

### Counterexample

Let's consider the counterexample provided in the original assessment:

- **Input**: `1 2 1`
- **Expected Output**: `Yes` (Nikita can add one cube and then remove one cube to end up with 1 cube after 2 moves).
- **Actual Output**: `No` (because `n - m >= 0` is true, but `n - m` is odd).

### Corrected Condition

The corrected condition should be:
```python
if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n >= m:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program is incorrect. The condition `n - m >= 0` is not sufficient, and it should be `n >= m`.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
