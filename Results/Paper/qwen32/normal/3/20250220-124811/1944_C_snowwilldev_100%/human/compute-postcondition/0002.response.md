Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `N` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < N, with the sum of `N` over all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is initialized as a defaultdict with default integer values, meaning it will return 0 for any key that does not exist in the dictionary. The initial state of `t`, `N`, and `a` remains unchanged.
