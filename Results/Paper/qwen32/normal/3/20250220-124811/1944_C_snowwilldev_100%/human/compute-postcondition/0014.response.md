Postcondition: **`t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `t` remains 0. `N` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < N, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values where `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, and `i` is 0.**
