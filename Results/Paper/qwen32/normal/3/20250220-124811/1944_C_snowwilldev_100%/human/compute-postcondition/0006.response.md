The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the defaultdict `cnt` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Similarly, `N` remains unchanged as it is only used to define the length of the list `a`. The list `a` also remains unchanged as the code does not modify its elements, only their counts in `cnt`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 outside of the provided code snippet, so it is not directly affected by this line. The defaultdict `cnt` is updated such that the count of `a[i]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < N, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.
