Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

### Key Points:

1. **MEX Definition**: MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**: 
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX, so she will try to fill in the smallest integers first.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX, so he will try to disrupt Alice's strategy by removing integers that Alice might pick.

### Strategy:

- **Alice's Optimal Move**: Alice should pick the smallest integer available that is not yet in `c` or that has only one occurrence in `a` to maximize the MEX.
- **Bob's Optimal Move**: Bob should pick integers that prevent Alice from filling in the smallest integers in `c` or that have more than one occurrence in `a` to minimize the MEX.

### Code Analysis

The provided code counts the occurrences of each integer in the array `a` and then iterates through the integers from 0 upwards to find the smallest integer `i` such that:
- `i` has zero occurrences in `a`, or
- At least two integers in `a` have exactly one occurrence each.

This logic is correct for finding the MEX under optimal play conditions. Here's why:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The `cnt` dictionary correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
2. **Finding MEX**: The loop iterates through each integer `i` from 0 upwards. It checks if `i` has zero occurrences in `a` or if there are at least two integers with exactly one occurrence each. The first such integer `i` is the MEX.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the MEX under optimal play conditions as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Reasoning: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in the array and determines the smallest integer that meets the criteria for the MEX under optimal play conditions.
Correctness: **True**
