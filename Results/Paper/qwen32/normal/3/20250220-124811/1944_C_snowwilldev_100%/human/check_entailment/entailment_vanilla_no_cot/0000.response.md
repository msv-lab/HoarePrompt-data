Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the optimal game score for Alice and Bob based on their strategies to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal moves that both players would make during the game.

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Optimal Strategy Consideration**: The program does not simulate the game turns where Alice and Bob make optimal choices. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. However, the program simply counts the occurrences of each number and checks for the first number with a count of 1 or 0, which does not reflect the interaction between the players' moves.

2. **Counting Logic**: The logic in the program considers only the count of each number and does not simulate the actual game process. It returns the first number that appears exactly once or is missing, which does not consider the sequence of moves by Alice and Bob.

To solve the problem correctly, one must simulate the game based on the strategies of both players or use a more sophisticated approach to determine the MEX based on the counts of each number and the players' optimal choices.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    
    mex = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 0:
            return mex
        if cnt[i] > 1:
            mex += 1
        else:
            mex += 1
            break
    return mex

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

This corrected version still needs further refinement to accurately simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob, but it correctly identifies the MEX based on the counts of each number and the players' strategies. However, the initial logic provided is not sufficient to solve the problem as intended.
