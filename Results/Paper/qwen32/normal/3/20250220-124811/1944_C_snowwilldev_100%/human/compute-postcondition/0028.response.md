To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop terminates and what the values of the variables will be at that point.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `N` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of `N` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < N.
   - `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values, where `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`.
   - `i` is initialized to `N`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = N` (inclusive).
   - For each iteration:
     - If `cnt[i] == 1`, then `t` is incremented by 1.
     - If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the function returns `i`.

### Conditions for Termination:
- The loop terminates when either `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` becomes 0.
- Given the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = N`, and `cnt[i]` is non-negative, the loop will definitely terminate because:
  - Either `t` reaches 2.
  - Or `cnt[i]` becomes 0 for some `i` between 0 and N.

### Determining the Output State:
- **Case 1:** If `t` reaches 2 before `cnt[i]` becomes 0, the function returns the current `i`.
- **Case 2:** If `cnt[i]` becomes 0 before `t` reaches 2, the function returns the current `i`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will terminate at the first `i` where either `t` is 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. Therefore, the final output state is the value of `i` at the point of termination.

### Output State:
The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the value of `i` at which the loop terminates.

Output State: **the value of `i` at which the loop terminates.**

In natural language, the output state is the value of `i` when the loop condition `t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` is met for the first time during the loop's execution.
