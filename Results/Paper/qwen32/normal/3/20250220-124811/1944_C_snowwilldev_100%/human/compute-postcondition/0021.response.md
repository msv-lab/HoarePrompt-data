Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we can determine the output state as follows:

The variable `i` is initialized to 1. The code simply returns the value of `i` without any modifications or calculations involving other variables. Therefore, the returned value is always 1.

Output State: **The program returns 1**.
