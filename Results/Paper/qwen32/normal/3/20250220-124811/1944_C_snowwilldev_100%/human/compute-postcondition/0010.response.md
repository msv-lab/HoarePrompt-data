Output State: **`t` is 0, `N` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < N, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values where `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, and `i` is equal to `N`.**

The value of `t` has been changed to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
