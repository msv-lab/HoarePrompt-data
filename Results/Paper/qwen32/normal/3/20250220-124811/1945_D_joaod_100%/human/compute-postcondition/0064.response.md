The code snippet provided increments the `total` variable by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. This means the new value of `total` will be the sum of its previous value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. No other variables are affected by this operation. 

Given the initial state, the output state will reflect this change in the `total` variable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0; `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers as read from the input; `total` is 0 + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `c` is `c + 1`; `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`; `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`**
