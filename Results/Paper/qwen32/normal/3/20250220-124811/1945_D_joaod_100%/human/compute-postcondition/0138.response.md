Postcondition: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` is greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`.**
