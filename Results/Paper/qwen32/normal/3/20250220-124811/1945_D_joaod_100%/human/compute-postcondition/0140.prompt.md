Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` must be greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` is greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `best` remains unchanged if `v` is greater than `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` is greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`. If `v <= pos_final`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` is greater than the updated `total`, then `best` is updated to the updated `total`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. If `v > pos_final`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` is greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente`. If `v` (which is `na_frente`) is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` before. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` before. If `v` (which is `na_frente`) is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
