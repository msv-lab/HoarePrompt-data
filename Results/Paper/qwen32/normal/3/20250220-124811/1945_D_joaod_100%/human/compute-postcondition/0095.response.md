The only variable in the loop head is `c` and `cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `c` and `cases`. If `c` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration, and `cases` remains unchanged.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `c` was some value `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`, and `cases` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`c` is `k + 1`, `cases` must be greater than `k + 1`**

However, since we do not know the exact value of `k` from the provided information, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` must be greater than the new value of `c`**
