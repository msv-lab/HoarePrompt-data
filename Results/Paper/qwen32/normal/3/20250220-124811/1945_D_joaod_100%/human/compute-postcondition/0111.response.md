The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` adds the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the current value of `total`. No other variables are affected by this code.

Given the initial state, the value of `total` was 0. After executing the code, `total` becomes `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

Output State: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` must be greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.**
