Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 (and must be at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input; `v` is `na_frente - 2`. If `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.**
