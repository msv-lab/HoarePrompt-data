Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1, `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers as read from the input, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged, `c` is `c + 1`, and `v` is `v - 1`.**
