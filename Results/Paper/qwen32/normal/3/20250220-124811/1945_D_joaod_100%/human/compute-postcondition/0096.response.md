Output State: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` must be greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is an integer from the input, `pos_final` is an integer from the input.**

In natural language: The value of `c` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `cases` must still be greater than this new value of `c`. Two new variables, `na_frente` and `pos_final`, have been assigned integer values from the input.
