Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1, `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers as read from the input. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` only if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `best`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` only if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is less than `best`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` is set to `sys.float_info.max`. In both cases, `c` is incremented by 1 and `v` is decremented by 1.**
