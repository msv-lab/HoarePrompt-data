The code snippet `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` adds the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to the `total`. The value of `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0; `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers as read from the input; `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `best` is `sys.float_info.max`; `c` is `c + 1`; `v` is greater than `pos_final`; `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`**.
