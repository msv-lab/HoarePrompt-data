Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers as read from the input; `total` is 0; `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` down to `0` where `v <= pos_final`; `c` is `c + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been reset to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial conditions.
