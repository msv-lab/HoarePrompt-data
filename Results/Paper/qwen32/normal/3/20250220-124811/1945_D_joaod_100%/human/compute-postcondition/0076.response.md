Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1, `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers as read from the input, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged, `c` is `c + 1`, and `v` is `v - 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The value of `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if this new value is less than the current `best`; otherwise, `best` remains the same. The values of `t`, `cases`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `c`, and `v` remain unchanged except for `total` and potentially `best`.
