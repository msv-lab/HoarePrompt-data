The code snippet `k -= nums[i]` will subtract the value of `nums[i]` from `k`. Given the initial state, `nums[i]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements are 0. Since `i` is `i + 1`, we need to consider the value of `nums[i]` at the current `i`.

Let's assume `i` is such that `nums[i]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements are 0. Therefore, `k` will be decremented by `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`, `nums` is a list where `nums[i]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.
