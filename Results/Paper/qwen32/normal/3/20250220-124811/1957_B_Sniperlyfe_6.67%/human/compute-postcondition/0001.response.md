The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function. The variable `t` and the list `nums` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, and since the problem statement already specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, the state of `n` already satisfies the requirement for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the loop head variables.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `nums` is a list of `n` zeros**
