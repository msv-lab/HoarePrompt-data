The code snippet provided assigns a specific value to `nums[i]`. Given the initial state, `nums[i]` was initially 0 (as all other elements in the list `nums` are 0 except for `nums[i]` which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`).

The line of code `nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` reassigns `nums[i]` to the value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. However, since `nums[i]` already holds this value, the assignment does not change the value of `nums[i]`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the values of `nums[i]` and other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 minus `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` minus `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `nums` is a list where `nums[i]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
