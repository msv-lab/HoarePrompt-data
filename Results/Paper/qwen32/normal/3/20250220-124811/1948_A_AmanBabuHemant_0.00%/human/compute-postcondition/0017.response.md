The code snippet `s = '110' * (n // 2)` updates the variable `s` based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is the new input integer, we need to consider whether `n` is odd or even to understand the effect on `s`.

- If `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be an integer division that effectively rounds down, meaning `s` will be `'110'` repeated `(n // 2)` times. The length of `s` will be `3 * (n // 2)`.
- If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be exactly half of `n`, and `s` will be `'110'` repeated `(n // 2)` times. The length of `s` will be `3 * (n // 2)`.

The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `_` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state description. The condition regarding the length of `s` being less than 200 or greater than or equal to 200 is determined by the value of `n` and does not change the fact that `s` is now `'110' * (n // 2)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is the new input integer; if the new `n` is odd, then `s` is `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times; if the new `n` is even, then `s` is `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times; `_` is incremented by 1.**
