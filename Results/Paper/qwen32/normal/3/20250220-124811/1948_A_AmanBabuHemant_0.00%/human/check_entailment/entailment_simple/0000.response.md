Reasoning:

The given problem requires constructing a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program provided checks if `n` is even or odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in the described configuration. If `n` is even, it constructs a string by repeating the substring "110" `n // 2` times and checks if the length of this string is less than 200. If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed string; otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, there is an issue with the logic of the program. The substring "110" does not create special characters as defined in the problem. According to the problem description, a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. In the string "110", the '1's are not special because they are equal to both of their neighbors, and the '0' is not special because it is not equal to any of its neighbors. Therefore, the constructed string does not meet the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.

The correct approach would be to construct a string that meets the requirement, such as alternating characters in a pattern that creates the specified number of special characters. For example, for `n = 2`, a valid string could be "AAAB", where 'A's at positions 1 and 3 are special.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
