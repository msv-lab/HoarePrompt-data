Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is even, then `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times; if the length of `s` is less than 200, it remains less than 200; otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.**
