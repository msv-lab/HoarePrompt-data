The code snippet `prime_to_i *= prime` updates the value of `prime_to_i` by multiplying it with `prime`. Given that `prime_to_i` was initially `prime * prime`, after this operation, `prime_to_i` becomes `prime * prime * prime` or `prime ** 3`.

All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their values and conditions.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list primes; `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty list; `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`; `prime_to_i` is `prime ** 3`; `factors[prime]` is `factors[prime] + 1`; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**
