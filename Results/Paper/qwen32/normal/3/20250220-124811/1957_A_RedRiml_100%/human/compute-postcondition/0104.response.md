Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `d` is unchanged except `d[i]` is set to 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None`, or incremented by 1 otherwise, `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
