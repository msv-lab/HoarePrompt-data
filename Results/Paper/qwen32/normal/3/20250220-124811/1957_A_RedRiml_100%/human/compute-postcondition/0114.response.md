The code snippet `shapes += d[j] // 3` modifies the value of the variable `shapes` by adding the integer division of `d[j]` by 3 to it. Here, `j` is the second element of the list `pl`, which is derived from `palka` and contains unique elements.

Output State: **`pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` and must have at least two elements, `j` is the second element of `pl`, `shapes` is incremented by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3.**

In simpler terms: The value of `shapes` is increased by the result of `d[j]` divided by 3 (integer division). All other conditions and variables remain the same.
