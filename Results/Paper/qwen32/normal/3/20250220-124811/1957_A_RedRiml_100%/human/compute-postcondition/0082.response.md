The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `ln`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `shapes`, or `w`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this new variable `ln` with the value of the input, while `t`, `shapes`, and `w` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer.**
