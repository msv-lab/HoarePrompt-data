The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `d`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, which remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary.**
