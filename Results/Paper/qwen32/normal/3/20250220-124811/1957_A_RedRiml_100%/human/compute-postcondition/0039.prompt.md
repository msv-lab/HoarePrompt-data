Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `palka`; `pl` is a list that contains each unique integer from `palka` in the order they first appear; `shapes` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `palka`; `pl` is a list that contains each unique integer from `palka` in the order they first appear and must have at least one element; `shapes` is `shapes` plus the integer division of `d[j]` by 3 if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `palka`; `pl` is a list that contains each unique integer from `palka` in the order they first appear and must have at least one element; `j` is the next element in `pl` after the last processed element. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `palka`; `pl` is a list that contains each unique integer from `palka` in the order they first appear and must have at least two elements; `j` is the second element in `pl`. If `d[j] >= 3`, then `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
