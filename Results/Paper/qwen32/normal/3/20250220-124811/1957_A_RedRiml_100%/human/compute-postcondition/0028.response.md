Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `palka`; `pl` is a list that contains each unique integer from `palka` in the order they first appear; `shapes` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new variable `shapes` and assigns it the value 0. All other variables (`t`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`, `pl`) retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
