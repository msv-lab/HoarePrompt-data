The code `shapes += d[j] // 3` modifies the `shapes` variable by adding the integer division of `d[j]` by 3 to it. The value of `d[j]` is not specified, but the operation is dependent on it. The other variables (`t`, `pl`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is `shapes` + `d[j] // 3`, `pl` is a non-empty iterable, `j` is `j_next`**

In simple terms, the value of `shapes` is updated to include the result of `d[j]` divided by 3 (integer division), while `t`, `pl`, and `j` retain their previous values.
