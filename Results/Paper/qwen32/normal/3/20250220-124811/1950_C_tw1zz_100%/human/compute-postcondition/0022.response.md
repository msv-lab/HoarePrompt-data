Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time and `h` equals '05', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `h1` is '05', `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `time` is 'AM'**.

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive, `h` is still the string '05', `m` remains a string representing the minute part of the input time, `h1` is still the string '05', `m1` remains a string representing the minute part of the input time, and `time` is now the string 'AM'.
