Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to convert a given time in 24-hour format to its equivalent in 12-hour format. It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the time in the format "hh:mm", splits it into hours and minutes, and then uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the equivalent 12-hour format and the corresponding period (AM or PM). The program then prints the converted time with the correct period.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Redundancy in Code**: The program uses a series of if-elif statements to handle each hour from 00 to 23. This can be simplified using arithmetic operations to avoid repetitive code.
2. **String Formatting**: The program uses multiple print statements with `sep=''` to format the output. A more concise and readable approach would be to use formatted strings.
3. **Handling Leading Zeros**: The program ensures that the minutes are printed with leading zeros, but it does not explicitly handle the conversion of hours to maintain leading zeros in the 12-hour format. For example, converting "00:00" to "12:00 AM" requires ensuring that "12" is printed with a leading zero if necessary.

Despite these points, the program does correctly convert the given times in the test cases to their 12-hour format equivalents and outputs them as specified. Thus, the program is functionally correct for the given problem description and test cases.

Correctness: **True**
