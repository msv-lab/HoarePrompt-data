Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '00', then `time` is 'AM', `h1` is '12', and `m1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `time`, `h1`, and `m1` remain as defined by the initial conditions.**
