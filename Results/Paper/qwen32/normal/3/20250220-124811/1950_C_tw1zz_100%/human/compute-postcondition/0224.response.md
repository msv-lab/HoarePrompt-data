The variable `time` is assigned the string value 'AM'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h1` is '10', `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, and `time` is 'AM'.
