The code assigns the value `'07'` to the variable `h1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time and `h` is equal to '07', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `h1` is '07', `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `time` is an empty string**.
