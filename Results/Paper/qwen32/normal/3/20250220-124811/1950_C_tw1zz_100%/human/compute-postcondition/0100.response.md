Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, and `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time. If `h` is equal to '23', then `h1` is set to '11' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is equal to '00', then `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**
