Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time and is not equal to '01', '02', or '03'. `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, and `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '04', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '05', then `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '06', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '07', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '08', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '09', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '10', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '11', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '14', then `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '15', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '16', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '17', then `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '18', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '19', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '20', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '21', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '22', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For all other values of `h` that do not match the above conditions, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**
