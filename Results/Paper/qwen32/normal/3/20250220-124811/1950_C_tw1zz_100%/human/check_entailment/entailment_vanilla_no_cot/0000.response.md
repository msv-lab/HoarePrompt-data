Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. However, it can be made more concise and efficient using a simple calculation to determine the 12-hour format and the AM/PM designation, rather than using a series of `if-elif` statements. Here is a more efficient version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        period = 'AM'
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h == 12:
            period = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
            period = 'PM'
        print(f"{h:02}:{m:02} {period}")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

The original program is correct, but the more concise version above is more maintainable and easier to read.
