The code snippet assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, `h1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `time` is `'AM'`, `h1` is `'01'`**.
