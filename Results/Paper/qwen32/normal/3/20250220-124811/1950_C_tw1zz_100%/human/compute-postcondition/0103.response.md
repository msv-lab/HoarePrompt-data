Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, and `time` is a string. If `h` is equal to '20', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is equal to '21', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is equal to '22', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is equal to '23', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is equal to '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For all other values of `h` that are not '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**
