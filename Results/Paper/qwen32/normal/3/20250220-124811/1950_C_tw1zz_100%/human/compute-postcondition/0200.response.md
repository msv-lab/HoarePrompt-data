To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables `h1`, `m`, `time` are derived from `h` and `m`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, representing the total number of minutes past midnight.
- `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time in 24-hour format.
- `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time.
- `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, which is the same as `m`.
- `h1` is derived based on the value of `h`:
  - If `h` is '00', `time` is `'AM'` and `h1` is `'12'`.
  - If `h` is '01' to '09', `time` is `'AM'` and `h1` is the same as `h`.
  - If `h` is '10' to '12', `time` is `'AM'` and `h1` is the same as `h`.
  - If `h` is '13' to '23', `time` is `'PM'` and `h1` is adjusted to the corresponding 12-hour format (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.).

The print statement is:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

Let's break down the possible scenarios for `h`:

1. **If `h` is '00'**:
   - `h1` becomes `'12'`
   - `time` becomes `'AM'`
   - Output: **12:m AM**

2. **If `h` is '01' to '09'**:
   - `h1` remains the same as `h`
   - `time` becomes `'AM'`
   - Output: **h:m AM**

3. **If `h` is '10' to '12'**:
   - `h1` remains the same as `h`
   - `time` becomes `'AM'`
   - Output: **h:m AM**

4. **If `h` is '13' to '23'**:
   - `h1` becomes `h - 12` (in string format, with leading '0' if necessary)
   - `time` becomes `'PM'`
   - Output: **h1:m PM**

Since the exact value of `h` and `m` is not provided, we need to describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour in 12-hour format derived from h, m is the minute part of the input time, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of h)**

To make it more precise, let's consider an example:

- If `h` is '14' and `m` is '30':
  - `h1` becomes `'02'`
  - `time` becomes `'PM'`
  - Output: **02:30 PM**

However, since we don't have specific values for `h` and `m`, the most precise description is:

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour in 12-hour format derived from h, m is the minute part of the input time, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of h)**
