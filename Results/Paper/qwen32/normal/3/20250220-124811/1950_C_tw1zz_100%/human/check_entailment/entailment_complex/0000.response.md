### Reasoning:
The provided program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. It reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually. For each test case, it splits the input string into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`). The program then uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map the 24-hour format hours to the corresponding 12-hour format hours and determine whether the time is AM or PM. The conversion logic is correct for all possible values of `h` from '00' to '23'. The program prints the converted time in the correct format, including handling the cases for '00' (midnight) and '12' (noon) correctly.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
