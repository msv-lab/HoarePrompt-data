Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '02', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '02'. If `h` is '03', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '03'. If `h` is '04', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '04'. If `h` is '05', '06', '07', '08', or '09', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is the same as `h`. If `h` is '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is adjusted to the corresponding 12-hour format. If `h` is '00', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '12'. For all other values of `h`, `time` and `h1` remain unchanged.**
