The given code snippet initializes a variable `k` to 0. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged because they are not modified in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `k` is 0.**
