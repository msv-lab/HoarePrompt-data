In the given initial state, several variables and conditions are described, but the `print` statement is independent of these variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `i`, `k`). The `print` statement simply outputs `-1`.

Here's the breakdown of the relevant information:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- Each of the next `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, each between 0 and 1,000,000,000.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 2 in some context (not directly affecting the `print` statement).
- `k` is initialized to 0 (also not directly affecting the `print` statement).

However, the `print` statement provided does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints `-1`.

Output: **-1**
