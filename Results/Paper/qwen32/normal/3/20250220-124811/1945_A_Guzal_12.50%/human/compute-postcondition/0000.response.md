The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the provided code snippet does not make use of `t` or the lines containing `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the value of `n` is the only variable that changes based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**
