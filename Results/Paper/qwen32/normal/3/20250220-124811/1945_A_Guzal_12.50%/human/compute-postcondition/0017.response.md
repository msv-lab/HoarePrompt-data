The code snippet `k += a + (b + c) // 3` updates the value of `k` by adding the sum of `a` and the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is not affected by this code snippet since it is incremented elsewhere in the description.

Given the initial state, the updated value of `k` will be `k + a + (b + c) // 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `k` is `k + a + (b + c) // 3`.**
