The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state describes several variables and their conditions, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, inclusive.
2. The following `t` lines each contain three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, each ranging from 0 to 1,000,000,000, inclusive.
3. The variable `n` is greater than 0, though it is not used in the provided code snippet.
4. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from the input, but again, they are not used in the provided code snippet.
5. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.
6. The variable `k` is initialized to 0, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.

Since the `print` statement is `print(-1)`, it will output `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `i`, or `k`.

Output: **-1**
