Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem is essentially about determining the winner of a game based on the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. If it is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy, assuming both play optimally.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`

This function seems to be intended to process the list of pile sizes by first converting it to a set (to remove duplicates), sorting it, and then computing the differences between consecutive elements. However, this transformation does not help in determining the game's winner based on the Nim-sum.

#### Function `func_2`

This function is recursive and attempts to determine the winner by considering the number of piles and their sizes. However, the logic used in this function does not correctly implement the Nim-sum strategy:

- The base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` are not universally correct. For example, when `n == 2`, the winner is determined by the parity of the first pile only if the piles are of different sizes. If they are the same, the Nim-sum is zero, and Bob wins.
- The recursive logic does not properly compute the Nim-sum or use it to determine the winner.

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation would compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determine the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or non-zero.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_2` is flawed, and `func_1` does not contribute to solving the problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
