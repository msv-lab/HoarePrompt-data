Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where players remove stones from piles according to specific rules. The key to solving this problem is to understand the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) in combinatorial game theory. The winner can be determined by calculating the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's analyze each function:

1. **`func_1(a)`**:
   - This function takes a list `a` of pile sizes.
   - It sorts the unique values of `a` and then computes the differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, this function does not directly contribute to determining the winner of the game. The transformation applied does not align with the rules or principles needed to solve the Nim game.

2. **`func_2(a, n)`**:
   - This function is intended to determine the winner based on the list `a` of pile sizes and the number of piles `n`.
   - The function uses recursion to determine the winner, but the logic does not correctly implement the rules of the game.
   - The base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` do not reflect the correct game rules.
   - The recursive logic does not correctly apply the XOR-sum principle to determine the winner.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we should compute the XOR-sum of all pile sizes. If the XOR-sum is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. Here is a correct implementation:

```python
def determine_winner(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, piles in test_cases:
        xor_sum = 0
        for pile in piles:
            xor_sum ^= pile
        if xor_sum == 0:
            results.append("Bob")
        else:
            results.append("Alice")
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]),
    (2, [1, 7]),
    (7, [1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]),
    (3, [1, 2, 3]),
    (6, [2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4]),
    (8, [5, 7, 2, 9, 6, 3, 3, 2]),
    (1, [1000000000])
]

print(determine_winner(t, test_cases))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic and transformations applied in `func_1` and `func_2` do not align with the rules and principles of the Nim game.

**Correctness: False**
