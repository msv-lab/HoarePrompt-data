a is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case. Each sublist contains n+1 integers, where the first integer n (1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5) is the number of piles in the game, and the next n integers (1 \le a_i \le 10^9) are the initial number of stones in each pile. The total number of piles across all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5.
