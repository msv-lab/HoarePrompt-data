Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. However, these functions do not directly address the problem of determining the winner of the game based on the given rules. Let's analyze why the program is incorrect.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sorts the unique elements of the list `a` and then computes the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list.
   - This transformation does not seem to have any direct relation to the game rules or the determination of the winner.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function seems to attempt to determine the winner by recursively analyzing the piles.
   - However, the logic within `func_2` is not based on the rules of the game. It does not correctly simulate the process of removing stones from the piles and does not account for the optimal moves of both players.
   - The base cases and the recursive logic do not align with the game rules described in the problem statement.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory. The winner can be determined by calculating the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR-sum is non-zero, Alice (the first player) has a winning strategy; otherwise, Bob has a winning strategy.

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def determine_winner(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, piles in test_cases:
        xor_sum = 0
        for pile in piles:
            xor_sum ^= pile
        if xor_sum == 0:
            results.append("Bob")
        else:
            results.append("Alice")
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]),
    (2, [1, 7]),
    (7, [1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]),
    (3, [1, 2, 3]),
    (6, [2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4]),
    (8, [5, 7, 2, 9, 6, 3, 3, 2]),
    (1, [1000000000])
]

results = determine_winner(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This implementation correctly determines the winner for each test case based on the XOR-sum of the pile sizes, which is the optimal strategy for this type of game.
