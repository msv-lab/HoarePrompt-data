The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This operation updates the value of `a` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `mdx` remains `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` if `n` is not 1, `res` is the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]` if `n` is not 1.**
