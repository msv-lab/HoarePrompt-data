Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so if `t` was initially in the range [1, 10^4], it is now in the range [0, 10^4 - 1]. The values of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged.
