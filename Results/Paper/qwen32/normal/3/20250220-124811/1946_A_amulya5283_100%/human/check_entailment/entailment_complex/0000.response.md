Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program, however, only counts the occurrences of the median element in the sorted list and outputs that count. This does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the current median and then figure out how many elements are less than or equal to the current median. The minimum number of operations required to increase the median is the number of elements less than or equal to the current median because each of these elements can be incremented to potentially shift the median upwards.

Here's a corrected approach:
1. Sort the array.
2. Determine the current median.
3. Count how many elements are less than or equal to the current median.
4. The result is the count from step 3 because each of these elements can be incremented to potentially shift the median upwards.

Given the current program's logic, it does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Correctness: **False**
