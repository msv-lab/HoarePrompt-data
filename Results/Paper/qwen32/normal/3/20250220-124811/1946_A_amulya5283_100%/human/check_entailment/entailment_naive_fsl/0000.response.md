Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   The array `a` is sorted, which is correct as the median is defined based on the sorted order.

2. **Median Calculation:**
   The median index `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula is correct for finding the median index in a sorted array:
   - For an odd-length array, `n // 2` gives the middle index.
   - For an even-length array, `n // 2` gives the lower middle index, and `n % 2` is `0` (so `mdx` is `n // 2 - 1`).

3. **Counting Operations:**
   The code counts how many elements from the median index to the end are equal to the median value. This is incorrect because it doesn't actually compute the number of operations needed to increase the median. Instead, it just counts how many elements are equal to the current median.

   To increase the median, we need to ensure that the median value itself increases. This means we need to increase the value at the median index or any value that affects the median when the array is sorted. The current code does not do this correctly.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The current median is `1` (since the array is `[1, 1, 1]` and the median is the second element).
- To increase the median, we need to increase one of the `1`s to `2` or higher. This requires `1` operation.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- The program counts the number of elements equal to the median (`1` in this case), which is `3`. This is incorrect because it does not represent the number of operations needed to increase the median.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Therefore, the correctness is False.
