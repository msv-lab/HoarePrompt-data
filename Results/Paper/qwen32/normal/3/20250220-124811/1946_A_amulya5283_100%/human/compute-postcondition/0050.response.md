The given code snippet contains a `print(1)` statement, which is independent of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, and `res` described in the initial state. The `print(1)` statement will simply output the integer `1`.

Let's break down the provided initial state to ensure we understand the context:

- `t` is initialized to `0`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` if `n` is not `1`.
- `res` is the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]` if `n` is not `1`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print(1)` statement. Therefore, the value printed will not be influenced by the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, or `res`.

Output: **1**
