The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `mdx`, and `res` remain unchanged as the sorting operation does not affect these variables. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `mdx` remains `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` if `n` is not 1, `res` is the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]` if `n` is not 1.**
