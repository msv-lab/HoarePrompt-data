The code snippet `n = int(input())` will reassign the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `res` if `n` was greater than 1) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and if `n` equals 1, the list `a` contains exactly one integer. Otherwise, `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` starting from index `mdx` to `n-1`.**
