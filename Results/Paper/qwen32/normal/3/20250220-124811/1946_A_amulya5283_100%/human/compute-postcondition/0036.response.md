To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. The loop iterates from `mdx` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `t - 1`, and we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`. Specifically, `i` starts at `mdx` and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2. **End of Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `t - 1`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, `i` should be `t - 1 + 1 = t` at the start of the next iteration.
4. **Other Variables**: The values of `n` and `mdx` do not need to be changed for the next iteration of the loop, as they are not modified within the loop head.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. It should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, if `n` equals 1, the list `a` contains exactly one integer, otherwise, `res` is 1 if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise `res` remains 0, `i` is `t`**
