The code snippet reassigns the value of `mdx` to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. Given the initial state, `n` is the input integer, and `mdx` is initially set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` if `n` is not 1. However, the code reassigns `mdx` regardless of the initial condition. Therefore, the value of `mdx` will be recalculated based on the current value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `res` is 0**.
