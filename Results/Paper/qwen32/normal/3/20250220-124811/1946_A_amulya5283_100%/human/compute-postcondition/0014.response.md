Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `mdx` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is set to 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
