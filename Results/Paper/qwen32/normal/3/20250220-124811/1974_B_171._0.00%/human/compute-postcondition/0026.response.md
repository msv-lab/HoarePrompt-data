The code snippet adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. This means that the `mapping` dictionary will now include this new pair, and no other variables are directly affected by this statement.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, and an additional key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`, `decoded` is a list containing either the value `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or `chr(c)` if `char` is not in `mapping` and `'a'` is added to `mapping` with `char` as its value, `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`.**
