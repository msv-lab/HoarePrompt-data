Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `'b'` was not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` is updated to include `'b'` as a key with the value `char`. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged. `decoded` remains an empty list. `char` remains the same. `c` is `ord('b')`.**
