Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `mapping` includes the key-value pair `'c': char` and any other previous mappings; `decoded` includes the appropriate elements based on the mapping rules; `char` is the next character in the `encoded` string; `c` is 99 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, and `c` remain unchanged, except that we have exited the most internal loop or if statement.
