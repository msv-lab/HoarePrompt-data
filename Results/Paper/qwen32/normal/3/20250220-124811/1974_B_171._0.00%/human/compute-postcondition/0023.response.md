Given the code snippet `decoded.append(mapping[char])`, we need to determine how the state changes based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
- `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value.
- `decoded` is a list that may contain the value `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or `chr(c)` if `char` is not in `mapping` and `'a'` is added to `mapping` with `char` as its value.
- `char` is the next character in `encoded`.

### Code Execution:
The code attempts to append `mapping[char]` to the `decoded` list. 

### Impact Analysis:
- If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` will have `mapping[char]` appended to it.
- If `char` is not in `mapping`, the code will raise a `KeyError` because `mapping[char]` will not exist. However, the problem statement implies that `mapping` should be updated with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value if `char` is not in `mapping`. This part of the logic is not in the provided code snippet, so we assume that the `mapping[char]` exists in the context of this snippet.

### Output State:
Given the above, we can conclude that `decoded` will have a new element appended to it, which is `mapping[char]`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, `decoded` is a list containing either the value `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or `chr(c)` if `char` is not in `mapping` and `'a'` is added to `mapping` with `char` as its value, `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `decoded` now includes `mapping[char]` as its last element.**
