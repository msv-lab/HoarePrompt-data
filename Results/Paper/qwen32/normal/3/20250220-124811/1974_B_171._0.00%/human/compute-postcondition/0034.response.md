The given code snippet modifies the `mapping` dictionary by setting the value of the key `chr(c)` to `char`. Given that `c` is 99, `chr(c)` translates to 'c'. So, the key 'c' in the `mapping` dictionary will be assigned the value `char`. No changes are mentioned for `decoded` or `encoded` in the code snippet provided.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `mapping` includes a key-value pair where the key is `'c'` and the value is `char`; `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)` if `chr(c)` was not initially in the values of `mapping`, otherwise `mapping` and `decoded` remain unchanged.**
