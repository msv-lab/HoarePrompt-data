You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

    #The program returns a string formed by joining all the characters in the list `decoded`. This string represents the decoded version of the original `encoded` string, where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding value in the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. Each unique character in the `encoded` string is mapped to a unique lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', and the function replaces each character in `encoded` with its corresponding mapped value to produce the decoded string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. The issue lies in the way the mapping from encoded characters to original characters is constructed. The program does not create the auxiliary string `r` with distinct characters in alphabetical order and then map each character in the encoded string `b` to its symmetric character in `r`. Instead, it attempts to map each character in `b` to the first available character that hasn't been used yet, which is incorrect.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Let's consider the input string `b = "serofedsoc"` from the problem statement. According to the problem, the correct decoding should produce `s = "codeforces"`. However, the provided program will not produce this result.

### Step-by-step Incorrect Behavior:

1. The program initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` and an empty list `decoded`.
2. For each character in the encoded string `b`, it checks if the character is already in the `mapping` dictionary.
3. If the character is not in `mapping`, the program searches for the first available character `c` from 'a' to 'z' that is not yet a value in the `mapping` dictionary and maps the current character from `b` to `c`.
4. The program appends the mapped character to the `decoded` list.

### Specific Example:

- For the first character `s` in `b = "serofedsoc"`, the program will map `s` to `a` (the first available character).
- For the second character `e` in `b = "serofedsoc"`, the program will map `e` to `b` (the next available character).
- This process continues, but it does not respect the symmetry based on the auxiliary string `r = "cdefors"`.

### Correct Approach:

1. Extract the distinct characters from the encoded string `b` and sort them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
2. Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
3. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

### Correct Code Example:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

This corrected program will produce the correct output for all test cases, including the one provided in the problem statement.
