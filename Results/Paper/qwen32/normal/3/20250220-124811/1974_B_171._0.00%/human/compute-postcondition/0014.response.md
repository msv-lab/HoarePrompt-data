Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `mapping` is a dictionary, and if `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`, `chr(c)` is now included as a new key with the value `char`. `decoded` remains an empty list. `char` remains the same. `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `chr(c)` was already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `char` remain unchanged, and `c` is still incremented by 1.**
