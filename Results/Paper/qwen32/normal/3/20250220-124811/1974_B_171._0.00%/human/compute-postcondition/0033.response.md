The only object in the loop head is the variable `c`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which means `c` will take on values from 97 (ASCII for 'a') to 122 (ASCII for 'z').

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 98 (ASCII for 'b'). For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1 to the next value in the range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `c` as 99 (ASCII for 'c').

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `chr(c)` was not in the values of `mapping` initially, `mapping` includes a key-value pair where the key is `'b'` and the value is `char`, and `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)`. If `chr(c)` was already in the values of `mapping`, no changes are made to `mapping` and `decoded`. `char` is the next character in `encoded`. `c` is 99**
