The code snippet `mapping[chr(c)] = char` assigns the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the `mapping` dictionary. This means that the `mapping` dictionary will now include the key `chr(c)` with the value `char`, assuming that `chr(c)` was not already a value in the dictionary. If `chr(c)` was already a value in the dictionary, the dictionary, `decoded`, and `char` would remain unchanged, but since the code snippet itself does not check for this condition, we will assume that the assignment occurs as specified.

The variables `encoded`, `n`, `decoded`, and `char` are not affected by this code snippet, except for the `mapping` dictionary being updated.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `mapping` is a dictionary with `chr(c)` as a new key and `char` as its value; `decoded` remains an empty list; `char` remains the same; `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
