The only variable in the loop head is `c`. The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which means `c` will take on each integer value from 97 (ASCII for 'a') to 122 (ASCII for 'z') in successive iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `c` will have taken on one of these values. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `c` by 1.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `c` was `k` (where `k` is some value between 97 and 121, inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `c` should now be `k + 1`.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `mapping` is a dictionary. If `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key `chr(c)` with the value `char`, `decoded` remains an empty list, and `char` is now in `mapping`. If `chr(c)` was already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `char` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`. `c` is now `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `c` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Since we do not know the exact value of `c` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `mapping` is a dictionary. If `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key `chr(c)` with the value `char`, `decoded` remains an empty list, and `char` is now in `mapping`. If `chr(c)` was already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `char` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`. `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
