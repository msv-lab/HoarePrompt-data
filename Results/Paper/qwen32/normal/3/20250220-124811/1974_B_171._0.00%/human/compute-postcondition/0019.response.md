To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop and the given states.

The loop iterates over all lowercase Latin letters from `'a'` to `'z'` (inclusive) using the variable `c`, which ranges from `ord('a')` to `ord('z')`. For each character `chr(c)`, if it is not already in the `mapping` dictionary's values, it adds `chr(c)` as a key with the value `char` and breaks out of the loop. If `chr(c)` is already in `mapping`'s values, it continues to the next iteration.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
1. After the first iteration, `mapping` includes `'a'` with the value `char`.
2. After the second iteration, `mapping` includes both `'a'` and `'b'` with the value `char`.
3. After the third iteration, `mapping` includes `'a'` and `'b'` with the value `char`, and `c` is `ord('b')`.

Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds a character not in `mapping`'s values, and it has already added `'a'` and `'b'` to `mapping` in the first two iterations, the loop will terminate after the second iteration if `char` is unique and not already in `mapping`'s values. 

If `char` is already in `mapping`'s values, the loop will continue until it finds a character not in `mapping`'s values. However, since the problem states the output after 3 iterations and the loop breaks as soon as it finds a character not in `mapping`, it implies that the loop will terminate after the first or second iteration if `char` is unique. Given the problem statement, we will assume `char` is unique and not already in `mapping`'s values, so the loop terminates after the first iteration.

However, based on the provided states and the nature of the loop, the loop will continue until it has added a unique character to `mapping` that is not already in `mapping`'s values. Since the loop iterates from `'a'` to `'z'`, and assuming `char` is not already in `mapping`'s values, the loop will add the first character it encounters (which is `'a'`), and then it will break.

Given the output states, it seems the loop adds characters to `mapping` until it finds a character not already in `mapping`'s values, and it breaks after that. Since the loop iterates from `'a'` to `'z'`, the loop will add characters to `mapping` until it has added all characters from `'a'` to `'z'` if `char` is unique and not already in `mapping`'s values.

However, since the loop breaks as soon as it finds a character not in `mapping`'s values and given the output states, the loop will terminate after the first or second iteration if `char` is unique. Therefore, the final state of `mapping` will include the first character it encounters, which is `'a'`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided states, the final output state is:

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is in `mapping`.**
