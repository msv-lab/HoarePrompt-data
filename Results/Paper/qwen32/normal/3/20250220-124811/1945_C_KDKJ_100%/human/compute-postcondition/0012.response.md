The code `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `S` to the variables `x` and `y`. Given the initial state, the last element of `S` is `[x, y]`. Therefore, `x` and `y` will be updated to the values of the last element of `S`.

If `a` is `'0'`, `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`, so `S[-1]` is `[1, 0]` and `x` and `y` will be updated to `1` and `0` respectively.
If `a` is not `'0'`, `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`, so `S[-1]` is `[0, 1]` and `x` and `y` will be updated to `0` and `1` respectively.

The value of `n` and the string `a` remain unchanged. The variable `s` also remains unchanged as it is the next character in the string `a` and is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least 1 character, `s` is the next character in the string `a`, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`. If `a` is `'0'`, `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`.**
