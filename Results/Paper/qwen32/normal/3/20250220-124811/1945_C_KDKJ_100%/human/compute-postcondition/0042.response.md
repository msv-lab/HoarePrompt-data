Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `left` is `S[k + 1][0]`, `lsum` is `k + 1`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[k + 1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (k + 1)`**.

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values.
