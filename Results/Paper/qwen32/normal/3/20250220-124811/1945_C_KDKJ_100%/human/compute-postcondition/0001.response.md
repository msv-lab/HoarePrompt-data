To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the function `func_1()`. However, since `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we can only infer the impact based on the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Given:
- The function `func_2` does not have any parameters.
- `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0.
- The code snippet is `func_1()`.

Since the function `func_1()` is called but not defined, we cannot determine its internal behavior or the specific changes it might make to any variables. However, we can still state that `func_1()` has been executed.

Output State: **The function `func_1()` has been executed, `func_2` does not have any parameters, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0.**

In natural language: The function `func_1()` has been executed, but its effects are unknown as it is not defined. The precondition that `func_2` does not have any parameters and that `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0 remains valid.
