The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `x` is `1` if `a` is `'0'` and `0` otherwise. Therefore, if `a` is `'0'`, `x` becomes `2`, and if `a` is not `'0'`, `x` becomes `1`. The values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least 1 character, `s` is the next character in the string `a`, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`. If `a` is `'0'`, `x` is `2` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `1` and `y` is `1`.**
