The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable, and the result of `int(input())`. Since `_` is not used within the loop, we only need to consider the state of `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` must have returned a value greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 1 in the current iteration. This is because the loop iterates `int(input())` times, and after each iteration, the count decreases by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the initial count must be at least 2.

State: **The function `func_1()` has been executed, `func_2` does not have any parameters, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 1.**
