In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n` (inclusive). To ensure that the loop executes, the value of `n` must be such that `n + 1` is at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 0.

The state before the loop starts is:
- `S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`
- `ans` is -1

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Since `i` is the loop variable that will be automatically managed by the `range` function, we only need to ensure that `n` is set correctly for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 0. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 0. The initial value of `i` does not need to be specified because it is controlled by the `range` function.

State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `ans` is -1, `n` must be at least 0**
