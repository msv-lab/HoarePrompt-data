Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the optimal position for the road. The program iterates through possible positions for the road and checks if the number of residents satisfied on each side meets the criteria. However, there is an issue with the initialization and comparison of the `ans` variable.

In the provided code, `ans` is initialized to `-1`. This means that the first valid position found will set `ans` to a non-negative value. However, when the program checks if the current position `i` is closer to `n/2` than `ans`, it uses the condition `abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)`. This condition will not work correctly for the first valid position because `abs(n / 2 - (-1))` is always a large positive number, making it unlikely that any valid position will satisfy this condition.

To fix this, `ans` should be initialized to a value that will ensure the first valid position is always considered. A common approach is to initialize `ans` to a value that is out of the range of possible positions, such as `float('inf')` or `n + 1`.

Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        (x, y) = S[-1]
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        S.append([x, y])
    ans = float('inf')  # Initialize ans to a large value
    for i in range(n + 1):
        left = S[i][0]
        lsum = i
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        rsum = n - i
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans) or (abs(n / 2 - i) == abs(n / 2 - ans) and i < ans):
            ans = i
    print(ans)
```

With this change, the program should correctly determine the optimal position for the road.
