The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **The function `func_2` does not have any parameters, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0**
