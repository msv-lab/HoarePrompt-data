The code snippet `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. Given that `y` is the last character of the string `a`, this operation will treat `y` as its ASCII value, increment it, and then convert it back to a character. For example, if `y` was 'a', it will become 'b'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least 2 characters, `s` is the next character in the string `a` after the current `s`, `x` is the last character of the string `a`, `y` is the character following the last character of the string `a` in the ASCII sequence.**
