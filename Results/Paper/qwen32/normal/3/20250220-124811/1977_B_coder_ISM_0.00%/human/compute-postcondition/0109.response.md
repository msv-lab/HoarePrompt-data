Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0'. `length` is 30. `t` remains unchanged. `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 30. `flag` is 0. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `s[i]` is now specifically '1'. Otherwise, `s[i]` retains its original value.**
