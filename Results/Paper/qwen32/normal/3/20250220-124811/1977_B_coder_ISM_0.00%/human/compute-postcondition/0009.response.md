The code snippet `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the list `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the list `s` is no longer empty but contains one element, which is the string `'0'`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing ['0']; `length` is 30; `i` is not yet defined as the loop has not started; the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0**.
