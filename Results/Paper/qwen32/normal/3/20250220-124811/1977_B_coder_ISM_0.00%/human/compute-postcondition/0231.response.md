Postcondition: **`length` is 31, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 28, `s` is a list of 31 characters representing the transformed binary form of `x` with no consecutive '1's, where the 30th character is '0' and the 31st character is '1', and `flag` is not 0, if `flag` was not 0 initially. Otherwise, `length` remains 30, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 28, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the transformed binary form of `x` with no consecutive '1's, and `flag` is 0.**
