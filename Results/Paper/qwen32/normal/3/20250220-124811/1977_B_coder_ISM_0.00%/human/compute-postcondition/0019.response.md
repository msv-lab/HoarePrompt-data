Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not; `length` is 30.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all 30 iterations, the list `s` will contain 30 characters, each representing whether the corresponding bit of the integer `x` is set ('1') or not set ('0'). The other variables `t` and `length` remain unchanged.
