Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not; `length` is 30; `flag` is 0; `i` is 0; if `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` remains '0'. Otherwise, `s[i]` is '1'.**
