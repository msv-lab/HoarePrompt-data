Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not; `length` is 30; `flag` is 0; `i` is 0; `flag` is not equal to 1; either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
