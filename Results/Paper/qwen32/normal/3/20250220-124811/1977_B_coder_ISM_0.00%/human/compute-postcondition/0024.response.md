Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing 30 elements where the first element is '1' and the remaining 29 elements are either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not; `length` is 30; `flag` is 1; `i` is 0; `s[i]` is '1'**

In simple terms, the first element of the list `s` has been changed to '1', while all other variables retain their initial values.
