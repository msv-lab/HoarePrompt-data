Postcondition: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `i` in `s` is `'-1'` and the element at index `i - 1` in `s` is `'1'`, then `s` remains unchanged except for the increment of `i`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged and `i` is still incremented by 1.**
