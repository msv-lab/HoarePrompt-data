The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `30`, which is a constant. The loop will execute 30 times regardless of the values of `t`, `x`, `s`, and `length`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the loop head alone.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an empty list; `length` is 30; `i` is not yet defined as the loop has not started**
