The value of `s[i]` is changed to `'0'`. The other variables, `length`, `i`, and `s[i - 1]`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `length` is 30 or 31, `i` is initialized to 1 by the loop, `s[i]` equals `'0'`, and `s[i - 1]` equals `'1'`.

Output State: **`length` is 30 or 31, `i` is initialized to 1 by the loop, `s[i]` equals `'0'`, and `s[i - 1]` equals `'1'`.**
