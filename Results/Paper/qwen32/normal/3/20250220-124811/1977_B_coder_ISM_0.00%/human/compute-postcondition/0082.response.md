To determine what will be printed by the `print(length)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - The string `s` has all `'1'`s shifted to the left of all `'-1'`s, with no `'1'`s directly followed by `'-1'`s.
   - The variable `length` is described as remaining unchanged unless a specific condition is met.
   - The variable `t` is mentioned but does not influence the `length` or the `print` statement, so we can disregard it for this task.

2. **Condition for Changing `length`:**
   - The `length` will be incremented by 1 and a `'1'` will be appended to `s` if two conditions are met:
     - The `flag` variable is `True`.
     - The 30th character of `s` is not `'1'`.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - If neither of the conditions to change `length` is met, `length` remains unchanged.
   - If the conditions are met, `length` is incremented by 1.
   - However, since the problem does not provide the exact value of `length` or the value of `flag`, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

Given the information, the output will be the value of `length` after considering the possible change based on the `flag` and the 30th character of `s`.

Output: **length (where length is the value of length after considering the conditions: if flag is True and the 30th character of s is not '1', length is incremented by 1)**
