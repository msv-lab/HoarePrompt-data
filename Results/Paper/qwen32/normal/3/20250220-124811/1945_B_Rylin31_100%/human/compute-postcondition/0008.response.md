The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state mentioned includes `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `i`. However, the code snippet does not affect `t` and `i`. It only updates the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` based on the new input.

Since the code snippet is reading new values for `a`, `b`, and `m`, the previous values of these variables are overwritten. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the new integers obtained from the input; `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1 and must be less than `t`.**
