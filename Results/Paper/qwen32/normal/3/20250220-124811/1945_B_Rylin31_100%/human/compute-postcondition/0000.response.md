Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `m` are each integers with values between 1 and 10^18, and the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

In this output state, `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input by the user, while `a`, `b`, and `m` retain their initial descriptions as integers within the specified range. The precondition regarding the number of test cases `t` is still valid.
