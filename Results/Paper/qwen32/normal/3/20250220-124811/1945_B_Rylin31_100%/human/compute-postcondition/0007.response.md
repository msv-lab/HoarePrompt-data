The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. 

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1 and must be less than `t`.**
