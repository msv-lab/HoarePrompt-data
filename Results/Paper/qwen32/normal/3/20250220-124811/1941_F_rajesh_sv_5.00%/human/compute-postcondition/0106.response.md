Output State: **`max_diff` is 2, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in A, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `A` is [1, 3, 5, 7], `D` is [1, 3, 5, 7], `F` must contain at least two elements, `left` is 1, `right` is 3, `ans` is 2, `h` is 2, `l` is 2, `mid` is 1, `mid_sum` is 3 + f, `mid_next_sum` is 5 + f`**

In natural language: The value of `l` is updated to be `mid + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
