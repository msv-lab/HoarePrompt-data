The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with three integers n, m, and k, representing the number of prepared problems, the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing the complexities of the prepared problems in strictly increasing order. The following line contains m integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_m, representing the complexities of the models. The last line contains k integers f_1, f_2, ..., f_k, representing the complexities of the functions. The constraints are 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i, d_i, f_i ≤ 2 · 10^9, and a_i < a_{i+1} for all valid i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m and k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
