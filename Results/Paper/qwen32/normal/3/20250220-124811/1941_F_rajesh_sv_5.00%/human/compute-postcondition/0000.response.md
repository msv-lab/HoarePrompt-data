Output State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()`**

In this case, the value of `testcases` is updated to whatever value is returned by the function `func_3()`. The precondition that `testcases` was initially an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= testcases <= 10^4, still holds true, but now it has been specifically set to the return value of `func_3()`.
