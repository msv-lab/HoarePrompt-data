Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F` are initialized to `-inf`, `max_diff` is `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is `diff`, `index` is `None`, `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]` and `diff` is not greater than `max_diff`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_max_diff` has been updated to the value of `diff`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
