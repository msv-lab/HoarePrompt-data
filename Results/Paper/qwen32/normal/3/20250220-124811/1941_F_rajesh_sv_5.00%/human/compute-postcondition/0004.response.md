The provided code snippet is simply calling the function `func_6()`. Since the function call does not assign its result to any variable or modify any existing variables directly, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0 is still valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0. The function `func_6()` has been executed.**
