Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is `t-1`, and for each of the `t` test cases, the program has read integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. For each test case, the program has printed 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.**

In simpler terms: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. For each of the `t` test cases, the program has read three integers and printed 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions specified. The variable `i` now holds the value `t-1`, indicating that the last iteration of the loop has completed.
