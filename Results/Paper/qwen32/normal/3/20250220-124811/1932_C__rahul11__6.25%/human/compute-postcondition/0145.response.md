To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`n`**: The first integer from the input, which represents the length of the list `arr`.
3. **`m`**: The second integer from the input, which is used in the modulo operation.
4. **`arr`**: A list of integers read from the input.
5. **`s`**: A list of characters from the input string, which presumably contains directions for the operations on `arr`.
6. **`res`**: A list of `n` integers where each element is calculated as `ans % m % MOD`. `res` is the result to be printed.
7. **`ans`**: The product of all integers in `arr` divided by all elements in `arr` as per the directions in `s`, modulo `MOD`.
8. **`c`**: Set to `n`.
9. **`l`**: Set to `r`.
10. **`r`**: Set to `l`.

### Analysis of `res`:
The list `res` contains `n` integers. Each element in `res` is calculated as `ans % m % MOD`. Here, `ans` is the product of all integers in `arr` divided by each element in `arr` according to the directions in `s`.

Given the information, we don't have the exact values of `arr`, `s`, `n`, `m`, `MOD`, or `ans`. However, we know the structure of the output list `res`.

### Output Description:
The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces. Since `res` is a list of `n` integers, each calculated as `ans % m % MOD`, the output will be these `n` integers.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of the elements in `res` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure and the calculation method of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is a list of n integers, each calculated as ans % m % MOD)**

This output description accurately reflects the given initial state and the structure of the `res` list.
