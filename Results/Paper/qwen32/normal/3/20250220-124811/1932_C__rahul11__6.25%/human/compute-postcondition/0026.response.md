The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is initially set to `n - 1`. After executing the code, `r` will be `n - 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the last element, modulo `MOD`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, and `s[k]` is not 'L'**.
