Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `k` is `n - 1`, and `res` is a list of `n` integers. If `s[k]` is 'L', then the `c`-th element of `res` is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are 0, with `ans` being `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` and `l` incremented by 1. Otherwise, the first element, second element, third element, and the element at index `c` of `res` are `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0, with `ans` being `(previous_value_of_ans // arr[r]) % MOD` and `r` decremented by 1.**
