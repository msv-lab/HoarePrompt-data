Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is also `ans % m % MOD`, the rest are 0, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]` modulo `MOD`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. Additionally, the character at position `k` in `s` is not 'L'.**

Explanation: The value of `r` has been decremented by 1, so `r` is now `n - 2`. All other variables retain their previous values.
