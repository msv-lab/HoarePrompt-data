The code snippet provided is `ans *= i`. This means that the variable `ans` is multiplied by the variable `i`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i`. Therefore, we can only express the new value of `ans` in terms of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string
- `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0
- `ans` is 1
- `c` is `n`
- `l` is `r + 1` (or vice versa)
- `r` is `l - 1` (or vice versa)

After executing `ans *= i`, the value of `ans` will be `1 * i` since `ans` was initially 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0, `ans` is `i`, `c` is `n`, `l` is `r + 1` (or vice versa), and `r` is `l - 1` (or vice versa)**.
