Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element, second element, and the element at index `c` are updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is decremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `r` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
