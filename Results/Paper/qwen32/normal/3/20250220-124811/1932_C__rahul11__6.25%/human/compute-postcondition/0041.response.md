Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where `res[c]` is `(ans % m) % MOD`, `k` is `k + 1`, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`.**

In this output state, the value of `res[c]` has been updated to be `(ans % m) % MOD`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
