Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 5, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first three elements are `ans % m % MOD` and the fourth element is now `ans % m % MOD`, the rest are 0, `ans` is calculated as the product of all elements in `arr` divided by either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` modulo `MOD` and further divided by `arr[r]`, `c` is 3, `l` is 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 3` if `s[k]` is not 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is 5, and `ans` is now `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.**

In natural language: The value of `r` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
