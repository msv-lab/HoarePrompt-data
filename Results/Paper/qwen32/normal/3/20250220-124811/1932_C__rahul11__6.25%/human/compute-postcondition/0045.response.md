Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where `res[c]` is now `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `k + 1`, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` is the result of `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is `r - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
