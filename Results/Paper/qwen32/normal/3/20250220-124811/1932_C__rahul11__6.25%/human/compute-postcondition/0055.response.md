The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0, `ans` is 1, `c` is `n`, `l` is `r + 1` (or vice versa), and `r` is `l - 1` (or vice versa)**.
