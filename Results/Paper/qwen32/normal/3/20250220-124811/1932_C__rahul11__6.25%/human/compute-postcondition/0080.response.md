Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 5, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element is `ans % m % MOD`, the rest are 0, `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`, `c` is 2, `l` is 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2` if `s[k]` is not 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is 4.**

Explanation: The code updates the third element of the `res` list (index `c`, which is 2) to be `ans % m % MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.
