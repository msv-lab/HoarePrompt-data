The value of `c` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are 0, `ans` is the product of all integers in `arr`, `c` is 1, `l` is between 0 and `n-1` depending on the number of 'L' characters, and `r` is between 0 and `n-1` depending on the number of non-'L' characters.**
