To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration of the loop. Let's break down the loop and the provided output states for the first three iterations.

### Key Variables and Their Evolution:

- **`pathb`**: A list containing values from `a` corresponding to nodes visited before the cycle.
- **`pb`**: The node that completes the cycle (remains unchanged throughout the loop).
- **`vis`**: A list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1 (remains unchanged throughout the loop).
- **`preb`**: Accumulates the sum of elements in `pathb` up to the current iteration.
- **`resb`**: Keeps track of the maximum value of `curr` computed in each iteration.
- **`ress`**: Remains 0 (not affected by the loop).
- **`pres`**: Sum of the first `i` elements of `paths` (not affected by the loop).
- **`i`**: Iteration index, which is the smaller of `len(pathb)` and `k`.
- **`paths`**: List that includes three additional elements `a[ps - 1]` from each iteration (not affected by the loop).
- **`ps`**: Node that completes the cycle (remains unchanged throughout the loop).
- **`curr`**: Computed as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` in each iteration.

### Iteration Details:

1. **After 1st Iteration**:
   - `preb` is updated to `pathb[0]`.
   - `curr` is `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`.
   - `resb` is `max(0, curr)`.

2. **After 2nd Iteration**:
   - `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[1]`.
   - `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`.
   - `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`.

3. **After 3rd Iteration**:
   - `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[2]`.
   - `curr` is `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`.
   - `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`.

### General Iteration Pattern:

For each iteration `i`:
- `preb` accumulates the sum of `pathb` elements up to the current index.
- `curr` is computed as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`.
- `resb` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `resb` and `curr`.

### Final Output State:

After all iterations (up to `len(pathb)` or `k`, whichever is smaller):
- `preb` will be the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the last iteration.
- `resb` will be the maximum value of `curr` computed in any iteration.

Let's denote the final values as:
- `preb` will be the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the last iteration.
- `resb` will be the maximum `curr` value computed during the iterations.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:

Output State: **`pathb` remains the same, `pb` remains the same, `vis` remains the same, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the last iteration, `resb` is the maximum `curr` value computed during the iterations, `ress` remains 0, `pres` remains the same, `i` is the smaller of `len(pathb)` and `k`, `paths` remains the same, `ps` remains the same.**

In Natural Language:
After all iterations, the `preb` variable will hold the cumulative sum of the elements in `pathb` up to the last iteration, and `resb` will hold the maximum value of `curr` computed during the iterations. All other variables will remain unchanged as per the initial state or as described in the problem statement.
