Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integer `a[ps - 1]`; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0. Additionally, if `vis[ps - 1]` is equal to 1, the index `ps - 1` has been visited and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integer `a[ps - 1]` and now also includes another `a[ps - 1]` at the end; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0. If `vis[ps - 1]` is equal to 1, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integer `a[ps - 1]` and now includes `a[ps - 1]` twice at the end; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
