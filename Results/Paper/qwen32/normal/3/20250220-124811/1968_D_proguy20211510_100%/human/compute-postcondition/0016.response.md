Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer equal to `p[pb - 1]`; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integer `a[pb - 1]`; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the element at index `pb - 1` is 1 and all other elements are 0. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
