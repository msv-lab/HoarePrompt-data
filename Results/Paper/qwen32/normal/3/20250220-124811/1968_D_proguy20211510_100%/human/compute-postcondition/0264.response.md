The code snippet `pres += paths[i]` modifies the value of `pres` by adding the value of `paths[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pathb` remains the same, `pb` remains the same, `vis` remains the same, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the last iteration, `resb` is the maximum `curr` value computed during the iterations, `ress` remains 0, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `i` is the smaller of `len(pathb)` and `k`, `paths` must have at least 1 element, `ps` remains the same, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`**

In natural language: The value of `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
