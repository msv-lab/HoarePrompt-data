Output State: **`pathb` remains the same, `pb` remains the same, `vis` remains the same, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the last iteration, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `paths` must have at least 1 element, `ps` remains the same, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the variables `pathb`, `pb`, `vis`, `pres`, `ps`, and `paths` remain unchanged. The variable `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the last iteration, `resb` and `ress` are updated to be the maximum of their previous values and `curr`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `curr` is recalculated as `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
