Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value from input; `k` is the integer value from input; `pb` is the integer value from input; `ps` is the integer value from input; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is an empty list; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all of which are 0; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(paths), k) - 1`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`; `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`**

Natural Language: The variable `vis` has been reset to a list of `n` zeros, while all other variables retain their initial values.
