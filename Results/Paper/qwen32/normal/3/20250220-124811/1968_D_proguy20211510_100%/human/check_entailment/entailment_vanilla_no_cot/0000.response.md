Correctness: **False**

The provided program is not correct due to several issues:

1. **Cycle Detection and Scoring Calculation**:
   - The program correctly identifies cycles in the permutation for both Bodya and Sasha, but the scoring logic is flawed.
   - The program calculates the score for each player by considering the sum of scores in the cycle and the remaining steps outside the cycle. However, it does not handle the case where the number of turns `k` is larger than the cycle length correctly.
   - Specifically, the program does not account for the repeating scores within the cycle after the initial cycle traversal.

2. **Handling of Large `k`**:
   - When `k` is very large, the players will traverse the cycle multiple times. The program needs to account for the sum of the cycle and the number of complete cycles within `k` turns, as well as the remaining steps after these complete cycles.
   - The program should calculate the sum of the cycle and multiply it by the number of complete cycles that fit into `k` turns, then add the scores of the remaining steps.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the starting positions are already in a cycle or where the cycle length is 1 (i.e., the player stays in the same position).

Here is a corrected version of the scoring logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def calculate_score(start):
            path = []
            vis = [0] * n
            vis[start - 1] = 1
            while True:
                path.append(a[start - 1])
                start = p[start - 1]
                if vis[start - 1] == 1:
                    break
            cycle_start = path.index(a[start - 1])
            cycle = path[cycle_start:]
            pre_cycle = path[:cycle_start]
            cycle_sum = sum(cycle)
            pre_cycle_sum = sum(pre_cycle)
            total_sum = pre_cycle_sum + cycle_sum
            
            if k < len(pre_cycle):
                return sum(path[:k])
            else:
                remaining_turns = k - len(pre_cycle)
                complete_cycles = remaining_turns // len(cycle)
                remaining_turns_in_cycle = remaining_turns % len(cycle)
                return pre_cycle_sum + complete_cycles * cycle_sum + sum(cycle[:remaining_turns_in_cycle])
        
        resb = calculate_score(pb)
        ress = calculate_score(ps)
        
        if resb > ress:
            print('Bodya')
        elif ress > resb:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the scoring is calculated correctly for all possible values of `k`, including when `k` is very large and the player traverses the cycle multiple times.
