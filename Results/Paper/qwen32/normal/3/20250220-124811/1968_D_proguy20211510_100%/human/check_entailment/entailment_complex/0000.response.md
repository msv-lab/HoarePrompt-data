### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, followed by the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation:** For both Bodya and Sasha, the program calculates the path they will take based on the permutation `p` starting from their respective initial positions `P_B` and `P_S`. It does this by repeatedly moving to the next position indicated by `p` until a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is visited more than once).

3. **Score Calculation:** For each path, the program calculates the maximum possible score that can be achieved within `k` turns. This is done by considering all possible ways to stay or move in each turn and choosing the strategy that maximizes the score. The score is calculated as the sum of the values in `a` at the positions visited, taking into account the number of turns remaining.

4. **Comparison and Output:** After calculating the maximum possible scores for both players, the program compares the scores and prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input as specified, calculates the paths and scores accurately, and makes the correct comparison to determine the winner. The program also efficiently handles the constraints given in the problem statement, such as the maximum number of test cases and the maximum value of `n`.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct for the given problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
