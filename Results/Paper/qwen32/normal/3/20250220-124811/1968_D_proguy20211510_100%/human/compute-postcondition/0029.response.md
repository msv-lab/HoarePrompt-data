Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**

In simpler terms, the value at index `ps - 1` in the `vis` list has been set to 1, while all other values in `vis` remain 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
