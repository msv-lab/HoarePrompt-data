Output State: **`pathb` contains at least one value from `a` corresponding to a node visited before the cycle, `pb` is the node that completes the cycle, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`, `paths` includes three additional elements `a[ps - 1]` from each iteration, `ps` is the node that completes the cycle. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as specified by the else part, which in this case does nothing. `curr` is `pathb[i] * (k - i)`**.

In simple terms, the value of `preb` has been updated to `preb + pathb[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
