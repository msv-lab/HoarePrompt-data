To determine the final output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the provided states.

The loop continues to execute until it encounters a node that has already been visited (i.e., `vis[ps - 1] == 1`). The loop appends the current node value from `a` to `paths` and updates `ps` to the next node in the sequence using `p`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the first iteration, `paths` has one additional element (`a[ps - 1]`), and `ps` is updated.
- After the second iteration, `paths` has another additional element (`a[ps - 1]`), and `ps` is updated again.
- After the third iteration, `paths` has yet another additional element (`a[ps - 1]`), and `ps` is updated once more. At this point, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, indicating that the node completes the cycle.

Since the loop breaks when `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the loop will not execute any further iterations after the third iteration. Therefore, the final state of the variables will be the same as the state after the third iteration.

The final output state is:
- `pathb` remains unchanged as it contains values from `a` corresponding to the nodes visited before the cycle.
- `pb` remains unchanged as it is the node that completes the cycle.
- `vis` remains unchanged except for `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1.
- `preb` remains unchanged as it is the sum of all elements in `pathb`.
- `resb` and `ress` remain unchanged as they are the maximum values of `curr` calculated during the iterations.
- `pres` remains unchanged as it is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`.
- `i` remains unchanged as it is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`.
- `paths` includes three additional elements (`a[ps - 1]` from each iteration), and `ps` is the node that completes the cycle.

Output State: **`pathb` contains values from `a` corresponding to the nodes visited before the cycle, `pb` is the node that completes the cycle, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` and `ress` are the maximum values of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`, `paths` includes three additional elements `a[ps - 1]` from each iteration, and `ps` is the node that completes the cycle.**
