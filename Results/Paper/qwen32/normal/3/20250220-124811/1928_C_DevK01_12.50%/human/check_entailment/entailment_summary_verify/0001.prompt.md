You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and an integer `x`. It returns a list `M` for each tuple in `q` that contains all divisors `i` of `n` such that `i >= x - 1` and `n // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `n // i` values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the logic and ensure that it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the given pattern of "settling in".

The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions and follows the sequence:
\[ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \]

Given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \), we need to find all \( k > 1 \) such that:
- The position \( n \) within the repeating sequence corresponds to the number \( x \).

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).

2. **Initial Check**:
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 because the pattern of settling requires an even number of positions to fit the sequence.

3. **Finding Possible \( k \)**:
   - It calls `func_1` with parameters \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it calls `func_1` again with parameters \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - It combines the results and removes duplicates by converting to a set.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds divisors of the given number \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It includes both the divisor and its complement (i.e., \( q // i \)) if it is also a valid divisor.

### Correctness Verification

- The program correctly handles the initial check for odd \( y \) because the pattern requires an even number of positions.
- The function `func_1` correctly finds divisors of a number that meet the criteria.
- The combination of results from `func_1` with different parameters ensures that all possible \( k \) are considered.
- The removal of duplicates ensures that each \( k \) is counted only once.

### Test Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: \( n = 10 \), \( x = 2 \)
   - Expected Output: 4
   - The program should correctly identify \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \).

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: \( n = 3 \), \( x = 1 \)
   - Expected Output: 1
   - The program should correctly identify \( k = 2 \).

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: \( n = 76 \), \( x = 4 \)
   - Expected Output: 9
   - The program should correctly identify the valid \( k \) values.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: \( n = 100 \), \( x = 99 \)
   - Expected Output: 0
   - The program should correctly identify that no valid \( k \) exists.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: \( n = 1000000000 \), \( x = 500000000 \)
   - Expected Output: 1
   - The program should correctly identify \( k = 1000000000 \).

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles edge cases, such as when \( y \) is odd, and correctly finds all possible \( k \) values that fit the given constraints.
