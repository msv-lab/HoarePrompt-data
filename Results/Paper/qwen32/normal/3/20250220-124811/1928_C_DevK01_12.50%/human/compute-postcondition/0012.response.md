Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1) and the last element is `q`. `i` is 1, and if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then the current value of `q` modulo `i` is 0. Additionally, if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` includes `i` as the second-to-last element.**
