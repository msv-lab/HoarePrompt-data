### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of determining the number of possible values of `k` for which Vasya's position `n` and number `x` can be valid under the described settling pattern. However, there are several issues in the code that suggest it may not function as intended:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the argument `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`. However, the function's documentation suggests that `func_1` is intended to take a list of tuples, which is not the case here. The function seems to be designed to handle a single integer `q` and an integer `x`, not a list of tuples.

2. **Incorrect Use of `math.sqrt`**:
   - The code attempts to compute the square root of `q` using `math.sqrt(q)`. Since `q` is an integer, this is valid. However, the code then checks if `w == w // 1`, which is always true for integers, and if `w` is an integer, which is also always true since `w` is derived from the square root of an integer. This check is unnecessary and can be simplified.

3. **Logic for Finding Divisors**:
   - The loop in `func_1` iterates from `1` to `int(w // 1)`, which is equivalent to iterating from `1` to `int(w)`. This loop is intended to find all divisors `i` of `q` such that `i >= x - 1` and `q // i >= x - 1`. However, the loop only goes up to `int(w)`, which means it might miss some divisors if `q` has divisors greater than `w` and less than `q`.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `k` is not valid (e.g., `k <= 1`). The problem statement specifies that `k > 1`, but the program does not explicitly check for this.

5. **Combining Results from `func_1`**:
   - The program combines results from two calls to `func_1` and converts the result to a set to remove duplicates. However, the logic for combining these results is not clear and may not correctly account for all valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with input handling, unnecessary checks, incorrect loop bounds, and unclear logic for combining results, the program is not correct as it stands.

**Correctness: False**
