Let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that the loop variable `i` starts at 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `int(w // 1)`. Since `w` is an integer greater than 1, `int(w // 1)` is simply `w`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples.
- `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1).
- `i` is 2.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the loop variable `i` because it is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted.

Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` in the next iteration will be 3, assuming that `w` is greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1). `i` is 3.**
