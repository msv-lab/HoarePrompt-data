Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list; a `TypeError` occurs because `math.sqrt` is called on a list. Additionally, `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
