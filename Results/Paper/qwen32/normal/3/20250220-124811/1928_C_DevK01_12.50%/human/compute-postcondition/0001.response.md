The provided code attempts to execute `w = math.sqrt(q)`, where `q` is a list of tuples. However, the `math.sqrt` function expects a single number, not a list of tuples. This will result in a `TypeError` because `math.sqrt` cannot operate on a list.

Given the initial state and the operation, the code will not successfully execute as intended, and `w` will not be assigned a value. The variables `q` and `M` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list; a `TypeError` occurs because `math.sqrt` is called on a list.**
