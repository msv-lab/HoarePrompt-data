Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y` and its Parity Check**: The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, and the program checks if `y` is even. This is not the correct approach to determine the possible values of `k`. The correct approach involves understanding the periodicity of the sequence, which is `2k - 2`.

2. **Incorrect Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to find values of `k` that fit the criteria, but it incorrectly calculates these values. It uses the formula `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` to find divisors, but these formulas do not correctly relate to the problem's requirements.

3. **Logic for Finding `k`**: The program does not correctly implement the logic for finding all possible values of `k`. The correct approach involves iterating over possible values of `k` and checking if Vasya's position `n` and number `x` fit the pattern described in the problem.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k - 1:
            if position_in_period + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if 2 * k - 2 - position_in_period == x:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_k(n, x))
```

This corrected program iterates over possible values of `k` and checks if the position `n` and number `x` fit the pattern described in the problem. It correctly calculates the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
