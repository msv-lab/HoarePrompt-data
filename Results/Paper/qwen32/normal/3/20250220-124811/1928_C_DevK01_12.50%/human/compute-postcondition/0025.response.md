Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1). If `q % i == 0` and `i >= x - 1`, the second element of `M` is set to 3 and `M` now contains an additional element `undefined`. If `q % i == 0` and `i < x - 1`, `M` remains unchanged except for the first element being `w`. If `q % i != 0`, `M` remains unchanged. `i` is 3.**
