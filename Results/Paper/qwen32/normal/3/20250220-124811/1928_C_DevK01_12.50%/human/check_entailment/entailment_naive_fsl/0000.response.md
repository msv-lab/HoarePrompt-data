Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not properly implement the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case. The function `func_1` is intended to find divisors of a given number, but it does not correctly handle the logic for determining the valid `k` values based on Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x`.

Here are a few issues and test cases that demonstrate the incorrectness of the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but this does not align with the problem's logic for determining valid `k` values. The correct approach involves checking the periodicity of the sequence and the position within that sequence.

2. **Logic for Determining Valid `k` Values**: The program uses a function `func_1` to find divisors, but it does not correctly apply the conditions specified in the problem description. The conditions for `k` involve checking whether the position `n` falls within a segment of the sequence where the number `x` can appear.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is 1 or when `n` is small relative to `x`.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
For `n = 5` and `x = 3`, the valid `k` values are those where the sequence includes `3` at position `5`. The only valid `k` value is `3`:
- Sequence for `k = 3`: 1, 2, 3, 2, 1

However, the provided program would likely not output `1` for this case because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine valid `k` values.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these issues.
