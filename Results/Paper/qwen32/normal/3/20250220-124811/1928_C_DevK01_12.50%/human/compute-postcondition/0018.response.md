Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1). If `i >= x - 1`, the second-to-last element of `M` is `2`, and the last element of `M` is `q`. If `i < x - 1`, the second-to-last element of `M` remains unchanged, and the last element of `M` is `q`. `i` is 2.**
