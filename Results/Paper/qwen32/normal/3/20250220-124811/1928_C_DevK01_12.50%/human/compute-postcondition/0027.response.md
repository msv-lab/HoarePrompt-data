Output State: **The program returns a list `M` that starts with `w` and contains all divisors `i` of `q` such that `i >= x - 1` and `q // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `q // i` values.**

This means that `M` begins with the element `w` and is followed by pairs of divisors `i` and `q // i` of `q` that meet the specified conditions.
