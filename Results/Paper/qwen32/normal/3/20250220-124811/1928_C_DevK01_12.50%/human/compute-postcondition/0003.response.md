The code snippet `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `M` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `M` will contain one element, which is the value of `w`. The other variables `q` and the condition for `TypeError` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing the integer `w`; a `TypeError` occurs because `math.sqrt` is called on a list; `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
