You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and q contains between 1 and 100 tuples.
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing the integer `w` if `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list; a `TypeError` occurs because `math.sqrt` is called on a list.
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        
    #State: - `M` will start with `w` and will contain all divisors `i` of `q` such that `i >= x - 1` and `q // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `q // i` values.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is:
    #
    #Output State:
    return M
    #The program returns a list `M` that starts with `w` and contains all divisors `i` of `q` such that `i >= x - 1` and `q // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `q // i` values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and an integer `x`. It returns a list `M` for each tuple in `q` that starts with `w` and contains all divisors `i` of `n` such that `i >= x - 1` and `n // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `n // i` values.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `M` that starts with `w` and contains all divisors `i` of `q` such that `i >= x - 1` and `q // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `q // i` values.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
