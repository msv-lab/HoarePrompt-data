Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n`, `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(0, n - j):
    if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
        count += 1
    else:
        count = 0
    if count == j:
        print(count * 2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0. `count` is not equal to `j`. If `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` is true, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0 and `s[k]` is not a question mark, `s[k + j]` is not a question mark, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 1. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program returns nothing. Otherwise, the program does nothing and `count` retains its value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 2. If `count` was incremented by 1 for each of the conditions (`s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]`), and `count` equals `j`, the program returns nothing (None). Otherwise, the program does nothing.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
