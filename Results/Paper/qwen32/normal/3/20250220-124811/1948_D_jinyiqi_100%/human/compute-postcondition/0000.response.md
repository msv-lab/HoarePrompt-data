The code snippet converts the input string `s` into a list of characters. The variable `s` is now a list rather than a string. The value of `t` and the constraints on the test cases remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a list of characters, where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark. The total length of all lists `s` across all test cases does not exceed 5000.**
