Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 2. If `count` was incremented by 1 for each of the conditions (`s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]`), and `count` equals `j`, the program returns nothing (None). Otherwise, the program does nothing.**
