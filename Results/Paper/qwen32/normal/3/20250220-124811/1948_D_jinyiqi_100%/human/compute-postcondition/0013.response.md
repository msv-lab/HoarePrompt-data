Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2, `j` is 0, and `count` is 1 if either `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`. Otherwise, `count` is 0. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.**
