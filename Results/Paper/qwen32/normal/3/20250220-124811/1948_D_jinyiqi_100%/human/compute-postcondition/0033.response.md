The code snippet increments the variable `count` by 1. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0, `count` is 1. The condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` is true.**
