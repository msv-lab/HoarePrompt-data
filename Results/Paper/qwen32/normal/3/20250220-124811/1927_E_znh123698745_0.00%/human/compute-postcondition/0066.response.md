Postcondition: **the number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` are integers read from input; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, then `answer` is `[1, n]` and `a` is `[1, -2]`. Otherwise, `answer` is `[1, 2]` and `a` is `[2, -1]`.**
