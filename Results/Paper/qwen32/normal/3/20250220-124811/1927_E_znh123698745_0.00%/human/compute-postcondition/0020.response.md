The code appends the element at the index specified by the last element of `a` to `answer`. Given the initial state, `a[-1]` is `a[0]` because `a` initially contains only one element, which is `0`. Therefore, the element at index `0` of `array` (which is `1`) is appended to `answer`.

After the operation, `answer` will contain the element `n` (from the initial state) and the element `1` (from `array[0]`). The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1, making `a[0]` equal to `1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is 1; `answer` contains the elements `n` and `1`; `a` is a list containing the integer `1`.**
