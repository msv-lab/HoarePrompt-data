The code snippet modifies the last element of the list `a` by decrementing it by 1. 

Given the initial state, `a` can be either `[1, -2]` or `[2, -1]`. After the operation `a[-1] -= 1`, the values of `a` will be updated to `[1, -3]` if `a` was `[1, -2]`, or to `[2, -2]` if `a` was `[2, -1]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation, so the values of `answer`, `n`, `k`, `array`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`answer` is either `[1, n, n-1]` or `[1, n, n]`; `a` is either `[1, -3]` or `[2, -2]`; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is 3.**
