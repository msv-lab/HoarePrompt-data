The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **the number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 1`; `n` is greater than `iterations`; `k` are integers read from input; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[-1]]`; the last element of `a` is decreased by 1.**
