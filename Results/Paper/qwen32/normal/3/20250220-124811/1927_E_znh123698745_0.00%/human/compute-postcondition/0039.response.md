Postcondition: **`answer` is either `[1, n]` or `[1, 2]`, `a` is either `[1, -2]` or `[2, -1]`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, and `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, then `answer` is `[1, n]` and `a` is `[1, -2]`. Otherwise, `answer` is `[1, 2]` and `a` is `[2, -1]`.**
