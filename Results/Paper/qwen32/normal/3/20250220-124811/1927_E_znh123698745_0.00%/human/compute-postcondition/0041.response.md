The code appends the element from `array` at the index specified by the last element of `a` to `answer`. Given that `a` is either `[1, -2]` or `[2, -1]`, the last element of `a` will be either `-2` or `-1`. Since list indices in Python can be negative, `-1` refers to the last element and `-2` refers to the second-to-last element of `array`.

If `a` is `[1, -2]`, then `a[-1]` is `-2`, and `array[-2]` is the second-to-last element of `array`. If `a` is `[2, -1]`, then `a[-1]` is `-1`, and `array[-1]` is the last element of `array`.

Given that `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, if `a` is `[1, -2]`, `array[-2]` is `n-1`, and if `a` is `[2, -1]`, `array[-1]` is `n`.

Thus, if `a` is `[1, -2]`, `answer` becomes `[1, n, n-1]`. If `a` is `[2, -1]`, `answer` becomes `[1, n, n]`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `array`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`answer` is either `[1, n, n-1]` or `[1, n, n]`; `a` is either `[1, -2]` or `[2, -1]`; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is 3.**
