The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element at the index specified by `a[0]` from the `array` to the `answer` list. Given that `a[0]` is `1` and `array` is a list of integers from `1` to `n` inclusive, the element at index `1` of `array` is `2` (since list indices start at `0`). Therefore, `2` is appended to the `answer` list.

The variables `n`, `k`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `1` remain unchanged. The `array` and `a` lists also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`answer` is [1, 2], `a` is [1, -1], `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive**.
