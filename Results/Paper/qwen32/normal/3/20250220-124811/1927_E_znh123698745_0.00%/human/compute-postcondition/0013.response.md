The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), and `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to `n`, but since `i` is already at `n-1`, the loop will terminate after this iteration because the range is `range(1, n)`.

Hence, there is no valid state for `i` that would allow the loop to execute one more time. The loop will terminate after the current iteration where `i` is `n-1`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is `n-1`**
