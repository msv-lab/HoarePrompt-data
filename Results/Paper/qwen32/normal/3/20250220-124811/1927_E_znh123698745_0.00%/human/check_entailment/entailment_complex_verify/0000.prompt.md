You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])

                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even. The function will be called multiple times (up to 10^4 times) with different values of n and k, and the sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        
        print(*answer)
        
    #State: the `answer` list generated by the last execution of the loop, which is `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2 + 1]` if `n` is even, or `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., (n+1)//2, (n+1)//2]` if `n` is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple pairs of integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. For each pair, it generates and prints a specific permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n`. The permutation alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers, starting with 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all possible values of n and k. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. 

Let's analyze the program with a specific test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4 2
```
**Expected Output:**
A permutation of length 4 where the sums of all continuous segments of length 2 differ by no more than 1.

**Possible Correct Output:**
```
1 2 3 4
```
Here, the sums of the segments are:
- 1 + 2 = 3
- 2 + 3 = 5
- 3 + 4 = 7

This is not a k-level permutation because the sums (3, 5, 7) do not differ by no more than 1.

**Another Possible Correct Output:**
```
1 3 2 4
```
Here, the sums of the segments are:
- 1 + 3 = 4
- 3 + 2 = 5
- 2 + 4 = 6

This is also not a k-level permutation because the sums (4, 5, 6) do not differ by no more than 1.

**Another Possible Correct Output:**
```
1 4 2 3
```
Here, the sums of the segments are:
- 1 + 4 = 5
- 4 + 2 = 6
- 2 + 3 = 5

This is not a k-level permutation because the sums (5, 6, 5) do not differ by no more than 1.

**Another Possible Correct Output:**
```
1 2 4 3
```
Here, the sums of the segments are:
- 1 + 2 = 3
- 2 + 4 = 6
- 4 + 3 = 7

This is not a k-level permutation because the sums (3, 6, 7) do not differ by no more than 1.

**Another Possible Correct Output:**
```
1 3 4 2
```
Here, the sums of the segments are:
- 1 + 3 = 4
- 3 + 4 = 7
- 4 + 2 = 6

This is not a k-level permutation because the sums (4, 7, 6) do not differ by no more than 1.

**Another Possible Correct Output:**
```
2 1 4 3
```
Here, the sums of the segments are:
- 2 + 1 = 3
- 1 + 4 = 5
- 4 + 3 = 7

This is not a k-level permutation because the sums (3, 5, 7) do not differ by no more than 1.

**Another Possible Correct Output:**
```
2 4 1 3
```
Here, the sums of the segments are:
- 2 + 4 = 6
- 4 + 1 = 5
- 1 + 3 = 4

This is not a k-level permutation because the sums (6, 5, 4) do not differ by no more than 1.

**Another Possible Correct Output:**
```
2 3 1 4
```
Here, the sums of the segments are:
- 2 + 3 = 5
- 3 + 1 = 4
- 1 + 4 = 5

This is a k-level permutation because the sums (5, 4, 5) differ by no more than 1.

**Actual Output of the Provided Program:**
```
1 2 3 4
```
This is not a k-level permutation because the sums (3, 5, 7) do not differ by no more than 1.

Thus, the provided program does not generate a k-level permutation for all possible values of n and k, and hence it is incorrect.
