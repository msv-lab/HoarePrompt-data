To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key object here is the result of `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will iterate.

Given that the loop is intended to run multiple times based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is a positive integer. The state before the loop starts should reflect that the input will yield a value that allows the loop to execute the required number of times.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
3. The state before the loop should ensure that the input value is a positive integer.

Since the problem statement mentions that the function will be called multiple times with different values of `n` and `k`, and these values are not directly used in the loop head, we only need to ensure that the input value for the loop is valid.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the input value is a positive integer.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, and the input value for the loop must be a positive integer.**
