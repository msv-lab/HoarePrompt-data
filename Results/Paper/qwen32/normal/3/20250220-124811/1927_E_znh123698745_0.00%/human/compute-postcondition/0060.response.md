Postcondition: **the number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` are integers read from input; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `answer` is `[1]`; `a` is `[1, -1]`; `i` is such that `((-1) ** i == -1)`**

This postcondition retains all the conditions from the precondition and adds the condition that `i` is such that `((-1) ** i == -1)`, meaning `i` must be an odd number.
