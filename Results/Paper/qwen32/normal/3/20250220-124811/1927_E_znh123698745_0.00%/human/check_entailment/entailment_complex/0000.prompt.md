Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) â€”
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even. The function will be called multiple times (up to 10^4 times) with different values of n and k, and the sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        answer = [1]
        
        a = [1, -1]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        
        print(*answer)
        
    #State: the `answer` list generated by the last execution of the loop, which is `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2 + 1]` if `n` is even, or `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., (n+1)//2, (n+1)//2]` if `n` is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple pairs of integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. For each pair, it generates and prints a specific permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n`. The permutation alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers, starting with 1.
