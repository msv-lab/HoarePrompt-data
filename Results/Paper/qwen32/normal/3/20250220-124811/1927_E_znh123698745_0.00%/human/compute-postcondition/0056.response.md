Output State: **the number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 1`; `n` and `k` are integers read from input; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**

In this output state, the number of remaining iterations and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from the initial state. The new variable `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`.
