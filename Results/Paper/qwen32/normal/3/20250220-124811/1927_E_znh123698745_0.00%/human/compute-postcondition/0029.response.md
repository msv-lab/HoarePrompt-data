The code snippet creates a new list `array` that contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The values of `answer`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged. The new variable `array` is introduced with the specified range of values.

Output State: **`answer` is [1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2 + 1 if n is even]; `a` is [n//2 + 1, -n//2]; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**
