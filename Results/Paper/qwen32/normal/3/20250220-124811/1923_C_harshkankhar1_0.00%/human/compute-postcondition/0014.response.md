To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `b` is a list where:
   - `b[0]` is 0.
   - For `1 <= i <= n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values determined by the condition `a[i] > 1`.

2. `a` is a list of cumulative sums of its original elements.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*a)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
- We need to understand the structure of the list `a` based on the given conditions.

### Understanding List `a`:
- `a` is defined as a list of cumulative sums of its original elements. This means that each element in `a` is the sum of all elements up to that index in the original list (let's call it `original_a` for clarity).
- For example, if `original_a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `a` would be `[1, 3, 6, 10]` because:
  - `a[0] = original_a[0] = 1`
  - `a[1] = original_a[0] + original_a[1] = 1 + 2 = 3`
  - `a[2] = original_a[0] + original_a[1] + original_a[2] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
  - `a[3] = original_a[0] + original_a[1] + original_a[2] + original_a[3] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`

### List `b`:
- `b` is defined such that `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative sum of `x` values where `a[i] > 1`.
- However, the specific values of `b` are not directly relevant to the `print(*a)` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a`, which are cumulative sums of its original elements.

### Output:
Given the information, the exact numerical values of `a` cannot be determined without knowing the original list. However, we can describe the output format based on the given conditions.

Output: **a (where a is a list of cumulative sums of its original elements)**
