The value of `b[i]` is updated to be the value of `b[i - 1]` plus `x`. The value of `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else `x` is 2. The values of `n`, `a[i]`, and `b[i - 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else `x` is 2; `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x`.**
