Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else `x` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is determined based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. If this condition is true, `x` is assigned the value 1; otherwise, `x` is assigned the value 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged and still must be greater than or equal to 1.
