The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers and a series of queries. Each query specifies a range within the list. The function calculates and prints the cumulative sum of the list elements up to each index. Then, for each query, it checks if the sum of the elements in the specified range is at least as large as the count of elements greater than 1 in that range, excluding the case where the range consists of a single element, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
