The provided code snippet only reads a line of input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline`. This does not affect any variables or perform any calculations. It simply reads the next line of input and assigns it to the variable `input`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the variable `input` which holds the value of the next line read from the standard input.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) which are the elements of the array a. The following line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of the values of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of the values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. `input` is assigned the value of the next line read from the standard input.**
