The code snippet appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `num` are not specified in the initial state, but `i` is known to be 2. The list `arr` is modified to include this new tuple.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `arr` has an additional element `(1 + s, 2, num)` appended to it.**
