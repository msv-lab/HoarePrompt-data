To determine what will be printed by the `print(s - 1, s)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Breakdown of the Initial State:
1. **`i` is `N`**: This just indicates that `i` is set to some value `N`.
2. **`s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]` and `s` is greater than `l`**: Here, `s` is taken from a tuple in the `arr` list. The tuple is selected based on the minimum of `eli` and `LA`. `s` is the first element of this tuple and is known to be greater than `l`.
3. **`num` is `nums[N]`**: `num` is the element at index `N` in the `nums` list.
4. **`arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`**: This means each tuple in `arr` represents a segment of equal elements in `nums`.
5. **`LA` is `len(arr) - 1`**: `LA` is the last valid index of the `arr` list.
6. **`l` is the first integer from the input**: This is the first integer provided as input to the program.
7. **`r` is the second integer from the input**: This is the second integer provided as input to the program.
8. **`eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order**: `eli` is the insertion point for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted `arr` list.
9. **`e` is the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`**: `e` is the second element of the tuple selected from `arr` based on the minimum of `eli` and `LA`.
10. **`s` is not equal to 1**: This is an additional constraint on `s`.
11. **The state of the variables remains unchanged unless `tc` is greater than 5 and `ppp` is 23**: However, since the problem statement does not provide values for `tc` and `ppp`, we can assume that the state of the variables remains unchanged.

### Analysis:
Given the above, the key variable for the output is `s`. `s` is the first element of a tuple in `arr`, and it is known to be greater than `l` and not equal to 1. Since `s` is not explicitly given a value in the problem statement, we can only describe it in terms of the conditions provided.

### Output:
The `print(s - 1, s)` statement will print the value of `s - 1` followed by the value of `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of arr[min(eli, LA)] and s is greater than l and not equal to 1)**
