The variable `LA` is assigned the value of `len(arr) - 1`. This means `LA` will hold the index of the last element in the list `arr`. The values of `i`, `s`, `num`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is N, `s` is the last index where a change in nums occurred or N, `num` is nums[N], `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in nums, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
