Postcondition: **`i` is N, `s` is the last index where a change in `nums` occurred or N, `num` is `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, and `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` is 23, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables also remains unchanged as there is no else part.**
