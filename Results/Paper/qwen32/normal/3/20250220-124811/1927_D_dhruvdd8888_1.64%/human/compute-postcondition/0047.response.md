The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1, -1`. The initial state and the conditions provided do not affect the values being printed in this statement. The `print(-1, -1)` statement will execute regardless of the values of `i`, `s`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, and `e`, as well as the conditions involving `tc` and `ppp`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variable values or conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **-1, -1**
