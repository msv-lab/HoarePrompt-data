The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `nums` to the variable `num`. This means that `num` now holds the value of `nums[0]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the array `a` for a test case; `a`, `q`, and the queries remain unchanged; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`.**

In natural language: The value of `num` is now the first element of the list `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
