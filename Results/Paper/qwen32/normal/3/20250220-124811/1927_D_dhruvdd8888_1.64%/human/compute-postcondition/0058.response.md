Let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and their relationships:**
   - `i` is set to `N`.
   - `s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`.
   - `num` is `nums[N]`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers from the input.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `e` is the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`.

2. **Conditions and their implications:**
   - If `s` is greater than `l`, and `s` is equal to 1, then `s` is also greater than `l`. (This condition is redundant as `s` being 1 and greater than `l` would already imply `s > l`).
   - If `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1, then `s` is still greater than `l`.
   - If `s` is less than or equal to `l` and `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
   - If `s` is less than or equal to `l` and `e` is less than `r`, the state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether `e` is less than or greater than `N`.
   - If `tc` is greater than 5 and `ppp` is 23, the state of the variables remains unchanged in all cases.
   - Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as well.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(l, r)
```

### Determining the Output:
The variables `l` and `r` are directly taken from the input and do not depend on any changes based on the conditions provided in the initial state. The conditions described in the initial state do not alter the values of `l` and `r` in any way.

### Conclusion:
Since the values of `l` and `r` are not modified by any of the conditions, the print statement will simply output the values of `l` and `r` as they were input.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are the input integers)**
