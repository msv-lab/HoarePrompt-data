The given `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`. This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The `print` function will output the values `-1` and `-1` as specified.

Let's break down the context to ensure there's no misunderstanding:
- `i` is `N`
- `s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`
- `e` is the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`
- `num` is `nums[N]`
- `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`
- `l` and `r` are the new integers from the input
- `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order
- `tc` is greater than 5, or `tc` is less than or equal to 5 and `ppp` is unspecified

However, none of these variables or objects influence the `print(-1, -1)` statement. The statement is hardcoded to print `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
