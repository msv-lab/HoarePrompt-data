Output State: **`i` is N, `s` is the last index where a change in `nums` occurred or N, `num` is `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` is the first integer from the input, and `r` is the second integer from the input. Additionally, `tc` is greater than 5. If `ppp` is 23, then the state of the variables remains unchanged as described.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains exactly as described in the initial state.
