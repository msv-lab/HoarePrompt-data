The code appends `-1` to the list `nums`. Therefore, the list `nums` will now include `-1` as its last element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the array `a` for a test case; `a`, `q`, and the queries remain unchanged; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input with `-1` appended; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list.**
