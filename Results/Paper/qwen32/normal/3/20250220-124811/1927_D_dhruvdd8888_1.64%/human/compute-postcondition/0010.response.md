The code snippet appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple consists of `(1 + s, i, num)`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 0, and `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, but the value of `s` is not specified. Therefore, the first element of the tuple, `1 + s`, will be `1` plus whatever value `s` holds. The second element of the tuple is `i`, which is 0, and the third element is `num`.

The value of `N` must still be at least 0, and `i` remains 0. The condition `nums[i]` is not equal to `num` is still valid as no changes have been made to `nums` or `num`.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, 0, num)` appended to it.**
