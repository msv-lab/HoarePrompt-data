To determine the output of the given print statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Variables and their Values:**
   - `i` is `N` (where `N` is some integer index).
   - `s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`.
   - `e` is the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`.
   - `num` is `nums[N]`.
   - `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are new integers from the input.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `s` is greater than `l` and `s` is equal to 1, then `s` is also greater than `l`. (This condition is redundant since `s` cannot be both greater than `l` and equal to 1 simultaneously.)
   - If `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1, then `s` is still greater than `l`.
   - If `s` is less than or equal to `l` and `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
   - If `s` is less than or equal to `l` and `e` is less than `r`, the state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether `e` is less than or greater than `N`.
   - The state of the variables remains unchanged if `tc` is greater than 5, regardless of the value of `ppp`.
   - Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(s, e + 1)`

Given the conditions and the initial state, the values of `s` and `e` are determined by the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the `arr` list. The exact numerical values of `s` and `e` depend on the contents of `arr` and the value of `eli`.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `eli`, and `LA` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `s` and `e`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

**Output:**
The code prints the value of `s` (the first element of the tuple at `arr[min(eli, LA)]`) and the value of `e + 1` (where `e` is the second element of the same tuple).

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element of arr[min(eli, LA)] and e is the second element of arr[min(eli, LA)])**
