To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `N` is the length of the array `a`.
   - `nums` is a list derived from `a` with `-1` appended.
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `e` is initialized to 0.
   - `num` is initialized to `nums[0]`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `N + 1` iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = N`).
   - In each iteration, the loop checks if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`.
   - If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr` and updates `s` to `i`.
   - Regardless of whether `nums[i]` is equal to `num`, `num` is updated to `nums[i]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `N`.
   - `num` will be `nums[N]`.
   - `s` will be the index of the last change in `nums` (or `N` if no change occurred after the last element).
   - `arr` will contain tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`.

Given this understanding, the final state of the variables will be:

- `i` will be `N` (the loop has completed all iterations).
- `s` will be the last index where a change in `nums` occurred, or `N` if no change occurred after the last element.
- `num` will be `nums[N]`.
- `arr` will contain tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

Output State: **i is N, s is the last index where a change in nums occurred or N, num is nums[N], arr contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in nums.**
