The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs two values, `-1` and `-1`, regardless of the initial state described. This is because the `print` statement explicitly specifies `-1, -1` as the values to be printed, and does not reference any of the variables or objects defined in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `i` is `N`
   - `s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`
   - `e` is the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`
   - `num` is `nums[N]`
   - `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`
   - `l` and `r` are the new integers from the input
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order
   - `tc` is greater than 5, or `tc` is less than or equal to 5 and `ppp` is unspecified

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(-1, -1)` statement explicitly outputs `-1` and `-1`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects defined in the initial state, the output will always be `-1, -1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
