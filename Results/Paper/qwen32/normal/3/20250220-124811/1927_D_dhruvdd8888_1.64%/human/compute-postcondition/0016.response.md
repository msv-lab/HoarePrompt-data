The code snippet `s = i` assigns the value of `i` to `s`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `s` will also be 1. The other variables (`N`, `num`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 1, `num` is `nums[0]`, and `arr` has a new element `(1, 1, nums[0])` appended to it.**
