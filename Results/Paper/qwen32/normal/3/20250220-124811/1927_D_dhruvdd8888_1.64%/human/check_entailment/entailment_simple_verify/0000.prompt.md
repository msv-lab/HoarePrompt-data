You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by grouping consecutive identical elements in the array and then processing each query based on these groups. However, there are several issues with the logic that can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling:**
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the first group that starts within the query range `[l, r]`. However, it does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple groups within the query range.
   - The logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` is flawed. It only considers the first group and does not check for different elements within the query range.

2. **Edge Cases Not Covered:**
   - The program does not handle cases where all elements in the query range are the same.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the query range spans multiple groups of different elements.

3. **Incorrect Output Handling:**
   - The program does not correctly output `-1 -1` when no such pair exists within the query range.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following input:

```
1
5
1 2 2 2 1
3
1 5
2 4
4 5
```

The expected output is:

```
1 2
2 5
4 5
```

However, the given program will likely output incorrect results for this input. Specifically, for the query `2 4`, the program might output `-1 -1` because it does not correctly identify the pair `(2, 5)`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. For each query, iterate through the elements in the range `[l, r]` and check for the first pair of different elements.
2. If such a pair is found, output the indices of the pair.
3. If no such pair is found, output `-1 -1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    tc = int(input[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(tc):
        N = int(input[idx])
        idx += 1
        nums = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + N]))
        idx += N
        q = int(input[idx])
        idx += 1
        queries = []
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, input[idx:idx + 2])
            idx += 2
            queries.append((l, r))
        
        for l, r in queries:
            found = False
            for i in range(l - 1, r):
                for j in range(i + 1, r):
                    if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                        results.append(f"{i + 1} {j + 1}")
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version correctly handles all the cases by checking each pair of elements within the query range and outputs the correct result.
