Based on the provided initial state, the key variables are `l` and `r`, which are described as "the new integers from the input." The state of the other variables (`i`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `eli`, `tc`, `ppp`) is described in detail, but none of these affect the values of `l` and `r`.

The `print(l, r)` statement will output the values of `l` and `r` directly. Since the initial state specifies that `l` and `r` are the new integers from the input, the output will reflect whatever values `l` and `r` have been assigned from the input.

Thus, the output will be the values of `l` and `r` as provided in the input.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are the new integers from the input)**
