Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0 or 1, `num` is `nums[1]`. If `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous `num` (which was `nums[0]`), `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, 0, nums[0])` appended to it. If `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous `num`, `s` is 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `num` is now updated to `nums[1]`. The conditions regarding `arr` and `s` remain as described, depending on whether `nums[1]` is equal to `nums[0]`.
