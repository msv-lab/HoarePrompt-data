The code snippet assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `num`. Given that `i` is 2, `num` will now hold the value of `nums[2]`. The condition that checks if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num` is irrelevant here because the assignment happens regardless of the condition. The array `arr` remains unchanged as the condition does not affect the assignment operation. The value of `N` and its precondition (that `N` must be at least 2) remain valid and unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `num` is `nums[2]`, `arr` remains unchanged.**
