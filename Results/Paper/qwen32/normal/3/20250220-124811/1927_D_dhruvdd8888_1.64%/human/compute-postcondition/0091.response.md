Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers which are the elements of the array `a`. Then, it accepts an integer `q` representing the number of queries, followed by `q` lines each containing two integers `l` and `r` representing the boundaries of the query. The function returns the sum of the elements in the subarray `a[l-1:r]` for each query.**
