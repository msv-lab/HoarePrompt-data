The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1, -1`. The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the values being printed. The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `i`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `tc`, or `ppp`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print(-1, -1)` statement directly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`.
2. The initial state and the conditions described in the precondition do not influence the values being printed by this statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **-1, -1**
