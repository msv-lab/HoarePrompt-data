To determine the output of the `print(l, r)` statement, we need to understand the values of the variables `l` and `r` based on the given initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `i` is `N`
- `s` is the last index where a change in `nums` occurred or `N`
- `num` is `nums[N]`
- `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`
- `l` is the first integer from the input
- `r` is the second integer from the input
- `tc` is greater than 5
- `ppp` is 23

The key information for our task is that `l` and `r` are described as "the first integer from the input" and "the second integer from the input," respectively. Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not explicitly given in the initial state, we can only describe them as the first and second integers provided as input to the program.

Therefore, the output of the `print(l, r)` statement will be the first and second integers from the input.

Output: **l, r (where l is the first integer from the input and r is the second integer from the input)**
