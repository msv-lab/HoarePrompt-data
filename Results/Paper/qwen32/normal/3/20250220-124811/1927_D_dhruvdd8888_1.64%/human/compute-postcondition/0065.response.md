To determine the output of the `print(s - 1, s)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided and understand the values of the variables `s` and `i`.

### Analysis of the Initial State:
1. **`i` is N**: This indicates that `i` takes the value of `N`.
2. **`s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`**: `s` is derived from the first element of a tuple in the list `arr` at a specific index. The index is determined by the minimum value between `eli` and `LA`.
3. **`e` is the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`**: `e` is derived from the second element of the same tuple in `arr`.
4. **`num` is `nums[N]`**: `num` is the element at index `N` of the list `nums`.
5. **`arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`**: This implies that `arr` contains tuples, where each tuple represents a segment of `nums` with equal elements. For example, if `nums` is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`, `arr` might be `[(1, 2, 0), (2, 3, 0), (3, 1, 0)]`, where each tuple is `(value, length, some_other_value)`.
6. **`LA` is `len(arr) - 1`**: `LA` is the last index of the list `arr`.
7. **`l` and `r` are the new integers from the input**: These are new values provided as input.
8. **`eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order**: `eli` is the insertion index for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr` to keep `arr` sorted.
9. **Conditions for `s` and `e`**:
   - If `s > l` and `s == 1`, then `s > l` (This condition seems redundant since `s == 1` implies `s > l` if `l` is 0 or negative).
   - If `s > l` and `s != 1`, then `s > l` (Again, this condition is always true if `s > l`).
   - If `s <= l` and `e >= r`, the state remains unchanged.
   - If `s <= l` and `e < r`, the state remains unchanged regardless of whether `e` is less than or greater than `N`.
   - The state remains unchanged if `tc > 5` regardless of `ppp`.

### Determining the Values of `s` and `i`:
- `i` is explicitly given as `N`.
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at `arr[min(eli, LA)]`. This means `s` is the value of the segment at the insertion point or the last segment, whichever is smaller.

### Output Calculation:
Given the print statement `print(s - 1, s)`, we need to determine the values of `s - 1` and `s`.

- `s` is the first element of the tuple at `arr[min(eli, LA)]`.
- `s - 1` is simply `s` minus one.

### Final Output:
The output will be the values of `s - 1` and `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where `s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`)**
