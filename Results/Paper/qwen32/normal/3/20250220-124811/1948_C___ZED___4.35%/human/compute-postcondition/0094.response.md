The code snippet assigns the value `True` to the variable `no_path`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string, `no_path` is True**.
