t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The first row and the second row of the grid are represented by strings of length n, consisting of characters '<' and '>' only, indicating the direction of the arrows in the grid.
