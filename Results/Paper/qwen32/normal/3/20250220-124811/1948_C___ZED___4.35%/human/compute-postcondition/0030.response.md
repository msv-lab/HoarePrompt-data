Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `a` is the input string.
- `b` is the input string.
- The second-to-last character of `b` is '>'.
- `k` is 3.
- `no_path` is a boolean variable that is `True` if `a[k]` is equal to '>', otherwise `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet only involves printing the variable `k`. According to the initial state, `k` is explicitly defined as 3. There are no operations or conditions that change the value of `k` in the provided snippet. Therefore, the value of `k` remains 3.

### Conclusion:
The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is 3.

### Final Output:
Output: **3**
