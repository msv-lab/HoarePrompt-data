To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `k`, `n`, and implicitly the range parameters `0`, `n`, and `2`.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `for k in range(0, n, 2)`, which means `k` starts at 0 and increments by 2 until it reaches `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are input strings, and `no_path` is determined by the character at index `k` in `b`.

Since `i` and the strings `a` and `b` are not part of the loop head, their values do not need to be adjusted. The variable `t` is also not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was at a certain value, and since it increments by 2 in each iteration, we need to increase `k` by 2 for the next iteration.

Let's determine the new value of `k`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was some value, say `k_prev`.
- For the next iteration, `k` will be `k_prev + 2`.

The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is the upper bound of the range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `k` is `k_prev + 2`, where `k_prev` is the value of `k` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same.
- `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path` remain unchanged.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k` at the end of the previous iteration, we can express the new state in terms of the previous `k`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `k` is `k + 2`, `no_path` is False if the character at index `k + 2` in `b` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` remains True**.
