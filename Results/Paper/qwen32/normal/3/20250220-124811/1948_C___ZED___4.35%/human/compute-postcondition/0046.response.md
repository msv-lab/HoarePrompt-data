The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the input integer `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string, and `b` is the input string. If the second last character of `b` is not '>', no further changes occur. If the second last character of `b` is '>', and `n` is 1, no further changes occur. If the second last character of `b` is '>' and `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the largest odd number less than or equal to `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-3` if `n` is odd. If `no_path` is `True`, all characters `a[k]` in the specified range were equal to `'>'`. If `no_path` is `False`, at least one character `a[k]` in the specified range was not equal to `'>'`.**
