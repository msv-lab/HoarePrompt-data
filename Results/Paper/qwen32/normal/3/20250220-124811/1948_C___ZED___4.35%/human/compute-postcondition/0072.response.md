To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2.
- `a` is a new input string.
- `b` is a new input string.
- At least one character at even indices in `b` is not `'>'`.
- If `a[k]` is not `'>'`, then `no_path` is `False`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains `True`.
- `k` is set to 3.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(k)
```

**Analysis:**
- The variable `k` is explicitly set to 3 in the initial state.
- The `print(k)` statement directly prints the value of `k`.

Since `k` is explicitly defined as 3, the output of the `print(k)` statement will be the integer 3.

**Output:**
Output: **3**
