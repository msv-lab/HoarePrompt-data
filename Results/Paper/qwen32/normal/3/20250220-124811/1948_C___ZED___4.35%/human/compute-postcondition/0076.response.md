To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2.
- `a` and `b` are new input strings.
- At least one character at even indices in `b` is not `'>'`.
- If `a[3]` is not `'>'`, then `no_path` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains `True`.
- `k` is set to 5.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(k)` statement will print the value of the variable `k`. According to the initial state, `k` is explicitly set to 5.

### Conclusion:
The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is 5.

Output: **5**
