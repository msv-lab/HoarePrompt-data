The code snippet `cnt = n - len(a)` calculates the difference between the input integer `n` and the length of the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, where each integer `a_i` was originally `a_i + (i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`.
- `cur` is 0.

The only variable that changes in the code snippet is `cnt`, which is assigned the value of `n - len(a)`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, where each integer `a_i` was originally `a_i + (i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`**.
