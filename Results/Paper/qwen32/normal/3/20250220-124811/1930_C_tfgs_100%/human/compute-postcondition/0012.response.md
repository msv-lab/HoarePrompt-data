The code sorts the list `a` in descending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `counter`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to be in descending order based on its original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, where each integer `a_i` was originally `a_i + (i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`; `cur` is 0.**
