Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, where each integer `a_i` was originally `a_i + (i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`; `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        cur -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1
    cur += counter[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1, `cur` is the previous value of `cur` plus `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - 2*adv` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` elements, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1` plus `a[i]` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, otherwise `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged, `i` is greater than 0 such that `1 ≤ i < len(a)` if the if condition is met, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt)` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, `ans` now includes `a[i]` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1 for each processed element, `cur` is the running sum of the decremented counts of the elements in `a` minus `adv` plus `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is recalculated at the start of each iteration and is now `cnt - adv` if `i > 0`, `ans` is a list containing all the accumulated values based on the condition and the value of `adv` with the new element `a[i]` appended, `i` is the final index of the last processed element in `a` or the end of the list, and `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` for the last iteration if `i > 0`. The count of `a[i]` in `counter` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1 for each processed element, `cur` is the running sum of the decremented counts of the elements in `a` minus `adv` plus `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is recalculated as `cnt - adv` if `i > 0`, `ans` is a list containing all the accumulated values based on the condition and the value of `adv` with the new element `a[i]` appended, `i` is `i + 1`, and `adv` is 0 if `i > 0`. The count of `a[i]` in `counter` is decreased by 1. `cur` is now `cur + counter[a[i]]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
