The code snippet provided is:

```python
counter[a[i]] -= 1
```

This line of code decrements the count of the element `a[i]` in the `counter` object by 1. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that will be affected by this line of code is the `counter` object. The `counter` object is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the list `a`. By executing this line, the count of the specific element `a[i]` in the `counter` object will be reduced by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1, `cur` is `cur - adv` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - 2*adv` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` elements, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1` plus `a[i]` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, otherwise `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `i` is greater than 0 such that `1 ≤ i < len(a)` if the if condition is met, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt)` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`. `ans` now includes `a[i]` as its last element.**

In simpler terms, the frequency of the element `a[i]` in the `counter` object is reduced by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
