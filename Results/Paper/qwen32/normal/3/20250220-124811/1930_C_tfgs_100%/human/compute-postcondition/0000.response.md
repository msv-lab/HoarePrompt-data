Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10⁹; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10⁵.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is now assigned based on the input, while the conditions for `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
