The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `best_y`. This change does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `max_sum` is 0; `best_y` is 1; `x` is the second element in `test_cases`.**
