Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
