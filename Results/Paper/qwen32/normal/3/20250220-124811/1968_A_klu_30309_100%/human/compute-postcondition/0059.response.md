The given code snippet calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` and assigns it to the variable `gcd_val`. However, the variable `y` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot compute the exact value of `gcd_val`. Therefore, we will denote `gcd_val` as `math.gcd(x, y)` in our output state.

The other variables (`results`, `test_cases`, `x`, `max_sum`, and `best_y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`**
