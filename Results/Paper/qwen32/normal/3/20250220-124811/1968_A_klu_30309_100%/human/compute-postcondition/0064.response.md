Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
