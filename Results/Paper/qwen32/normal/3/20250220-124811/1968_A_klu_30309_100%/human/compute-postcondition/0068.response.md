Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation: The value of `current_sum` is updated to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. All other variables retain their initial state values.
