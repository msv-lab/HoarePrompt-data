To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step by step.

The loop iterates from `y = x - 1` down to `1`, and for each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y`. It then calculates `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` to `current_sum` and `best_y` to `y`, and then breaks out of the loop. If no `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum` during the iterations, `max_sum` and `best_y` retain their initial values.

Given that the loop breaks as soon as it finds a `current_sum` greater than `max_sum`, the loop will terminate after the first iteration where this condition is met. Therefore, the number of iterations does not necessarily correspond to the number of times the loop runs but rather to the number of times the loop body is executed before the break condition is satisfied.

Since the loop breaks after the first iteration where `current_sum` exceeds `max_sum`, the final state will be determined by the first such occurrence. If no such occurrence happens, `best_y` and `max_sum` remain `1` and `0` respectively.

Let's assume the loop runs for all iterations until `y` reaches `1` without finding a `current_sum` greater than `max_sum`. In this case, `best_y` and `max_sum` will not be updated from their initial values.

However, since the problem states that the loop has executed 3 times, it implies that the loop did not break within these 3 iterations. Therefore, `best_y` and `max_sum` will still be `1` and `0` respectively because no `current_sum` was greater than `max_sum` within these iterations.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the `results` list will have `best_y` (which is 1) appended to it, `test_cases` will still have at least one more element, `x` will remain the next element in `test_cases`, `max_sum` will remain 0, and `best_y` will remain 1.
