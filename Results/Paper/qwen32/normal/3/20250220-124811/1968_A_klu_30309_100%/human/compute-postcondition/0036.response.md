The code snippet `best_y = y` updates the value of `best_y` to the current value of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000), `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000), `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is the current `y`, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y` and is greater than `max_sum`.**

In simple terms, the value of `best_y` has been updated to the current value of `y`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
