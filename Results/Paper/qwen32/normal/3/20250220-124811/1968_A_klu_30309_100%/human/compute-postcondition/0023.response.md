Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; `best_y` is `y`.**

Explanation: The value of `best_y` is set to the current value of `y`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
