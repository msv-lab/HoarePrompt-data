The only variable in the loop head is `x` and the iterable is `test_cases`. This means we can only adjust the state of `x` and the state of `test_cases` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the last element of `test_cases` that was processed. For the loop to execute again, there must be another element in `test_cases` that `x` can take on in the next iteration. Therefore, `test_cases` must have at least one more element after the current `x`.

Since `x` was the last processed element, in the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in `test_cases`. We do not have specific information about the contents of `test_cases` other than it must have more elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**
