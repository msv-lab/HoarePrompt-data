The code snippet initializes a variable `max_sum` to 0. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer x where 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is 0.**
