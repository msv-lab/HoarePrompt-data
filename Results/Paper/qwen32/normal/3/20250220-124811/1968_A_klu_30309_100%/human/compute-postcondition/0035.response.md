Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000), `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000), `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is the current `y` that led to `current_sum`, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y` and is greater than `max_sum`.**

In simple terms, the value of `max_sum` is now updated to be equal to `current_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged.
