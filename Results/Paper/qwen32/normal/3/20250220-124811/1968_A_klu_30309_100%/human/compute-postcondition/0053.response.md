To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how it updates the variables.

The loop iterates over `y` starting from `x - 1` down to `1`. For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y`, computes `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`, and checks if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. If it is, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`. The loop breaks as soon as a new maximum is found.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop might have found the best `y` within these iterations. However, to ensure we have the final output state, we need to consider what happens after the loop completes all iterations.

### Final Output State Analysis:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`.
- `x` remains the second element in `test_cases`.
- `max_sum` will hold the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the loop.
- `best_y` will hold the `y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y`.
- `y` will be the last value checked by the loop, but it doesn't affect the final output state since the loop breaks on finding the first maximum.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute until it finds the first `y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y`, and then it breaks. Therefore, the final state will have `max_sum` and `best_y` updated to reflect this maximum value and corresponding `y`.

**Output State:**
Output State: **t remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); test_cases remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000); results contains the best_y for the first x in test_cases; x is the second element in test_cases; max_sum is the maximum value of gcd_val + y found during the loop; best_y is the y that maximizes gcd_val + y.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `t` and `test_cases` remain the same, `results` will have the best `y` for the first `x`, `x` remains the second element in `test_cases`, and `max_sum` and `best_y` will hold the maximum sum and corresponding `y` found during the loop iterations.
