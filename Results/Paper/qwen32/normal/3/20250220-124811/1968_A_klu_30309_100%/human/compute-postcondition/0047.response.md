Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `x` is the second element in `test_cases`; `y` is `y + 1`; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.**

Natural language: The value of `t` and `test_cases` remain the same. The `results` list still contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`. The variable `x` is still the second element in `test_cases`, and `y` has been incremented by 1. A new variable `gcd_val` is introduced, which holds the greatest common divisor of `x` and the incremented `y`.
