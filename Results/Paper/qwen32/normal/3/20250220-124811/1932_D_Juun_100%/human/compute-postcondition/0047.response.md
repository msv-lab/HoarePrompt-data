The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('IMPOSSIBLE')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the string to be printed is hardcoded and does not reference any of the variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
