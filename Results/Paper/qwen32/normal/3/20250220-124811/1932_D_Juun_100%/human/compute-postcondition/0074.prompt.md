You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16. The trump suit is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}. The description of 2n cards is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'} and the second character is a suit from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}.
def func_1():

    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:

    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():

    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `t` is 50, `n` is 8, `trump` is 'H', `trumps` is `[]`, `answers` is `['23', '45', 'HQ QH', 'NoneHA H', 'NoneSH KH']`, `suits` is {'C': None, 'D': ['6', '7'], 'H': None, 'S': None}, `answer` is 'NoneHA H'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value in any of the specified cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing.

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program returns nothing (None)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
