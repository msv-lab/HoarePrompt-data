Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump` is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; the description of 2n cards is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'} and the second character is a suit from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; if `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the `rank` of the current card; otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is either an empty list or a list with one additional string entry formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with the `suit` character; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value for the key `suit` is either `None` or `rank`; `rank` is the rank of the card (a character from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'}); and `suit` is the suit of the card (a character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}). If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` contains the `rank` of the current card. If `suit` does not equal `trump`, `answers` is updated with a string formed by the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with the `suit` character, and `suits[suit]` is set to `rank` if it was `None`, otherwise `suits[suit]` remains `None`.**
