Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was given; `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and if `maxi` is not 0, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer provided by the user. The values of `t`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `mini` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
