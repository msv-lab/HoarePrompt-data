The code snippet `res = input()` takes a new input string and assigns it to the variable `res`. This changes the value of `res` but does not affect the other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `arr`, `i`). The variable `i` is mentioned to be `i + 1` in the initial state, but since this operation is not part of the provided code snippet, `i` remains unchanged in this execution.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` is `[0]`, and `res` is the new input string.**
