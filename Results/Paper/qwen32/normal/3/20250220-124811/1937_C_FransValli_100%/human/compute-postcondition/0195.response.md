Output State: **For each test case, `maxi` is the index of the largest element in the permutation `p`, and `mini` is the index of the smallest element in the permutation `p`.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, for each test case, the algorithm will have identified the indices of the largest and smallest elements in the given permutation `p`. The variable `maxi` will hold the index of the largest element, and `mini` will hold the index of the smallest element.
