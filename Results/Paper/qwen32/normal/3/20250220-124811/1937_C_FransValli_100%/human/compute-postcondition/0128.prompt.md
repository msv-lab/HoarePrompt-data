Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and is reset to `[i]` if the user's input was `'<'`; `mini` is the first element of `arr`; `i` is `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` contains at least two elements; `mini` is `item` if `res` equals `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains the first element of `arr`; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is the user's input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` contains at least two elements; `mini` is the next element in `arr[1:]` if `res` equals `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains the first element of `arr`; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is the user's new input; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` contains at least two elements; `mini` is the next element in `arr[1:]` if `res` equals `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains the first element of `arr`; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is the user's new input; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`. If `res` equals `'>'`, then `mini` is updated to the next element in `arr[1:]`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the first element of `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
