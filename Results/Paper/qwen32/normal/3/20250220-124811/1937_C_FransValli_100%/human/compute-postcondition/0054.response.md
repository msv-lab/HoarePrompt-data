Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable seems to be related to the number of test cases or iterations.
2. **`n`**: An input integer. This could represent the number of elements in the list `arr` or some other parameter.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest index `i` (from 1 to \(n-1\)) for which the user's input was `'<'`. If no such input was given, `maxi` is `0`.
4. **`arr`**: A list with at least two elements. This list seems to contain elements that are being compared.
5. **`res`**: A variable that holds the result of some comparison, possibly `'>'` or `'<'`.
6. **`mini`**: This variable is set to the next element `item` in `arr` if `res` is `'>'`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the first element of `arr`.
7. **`item`**: The next element in `arr` after the current `item`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```
This statement will print:
- The character `'?'`.
- The value of `mini` twice.
- The value of `item` twice.

### Determining the Values:
- **`mini`**: 
  - If `res` is `'>'`, `mini` is set to `item`. 
  - Otherwise, `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
- **`item`**: The next element in `arr` after the current `item`. This suggests that `item` is being iterated through the list `arr`.

### Final Output:
Given the conditions, we can't know the exact values of `mini` and `item` without more specific information about the list `arr` and the value of `res`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

- If `res` is `'>'`, `mini` will be the same as `item`.
- If `res` is not `'>'`, `mini` will be the first element of `arr`.

Since the exact values of `mini` and `item` are not specified, we describe them in terms of the conditions provided.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where mini is the first element of arr if res is not '>', otherwise mini is the same as item, and item is the next element in arr after the current item)**
