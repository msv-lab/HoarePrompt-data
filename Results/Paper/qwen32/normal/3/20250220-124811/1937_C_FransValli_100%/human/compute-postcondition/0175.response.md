To determine the final state of the loop after all iterations, let's break down the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3.
   - `n` is the input integer (greater than 1).
   - `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given.
   - `arr` is `[0]`.
   - `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each `i`, the program prints a query and reads a response `res`.
   - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is set to `[i]`.
   - If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is extended with `i`.

3. **Final State**:
   - The loop will run `n-1` times.
   - The final value of `i` will be `n-1`.
   - The value of `maxi` will be the largest index for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given.
   - The value of `mini` will be the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found.
   - The array `arr` will contain all indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'`.

Given the behavior of the loop, after all iterations, the final state of the variables will be:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `maxi` will be the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given.
- `arr` will contain all indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'`.
- `mini` will be the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found.
- `i` will be `n-1`.

**Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` and `n` remain the same. `arr` will have all indices `i` where the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` where the response was `'<'`. `maxi` will be the largest index with a `'<'` response, and `mini` will be the last `'>'` response index or the first element of `arr` if no `'>'` response was given. The loop variable `i` will be `n-1`.
