To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: This is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). However, it is not used in the print statement.
2. **`n`**: It is mentioned that `n` is greater than 1, but it is also not used in the print statement.
3. **`res`**: This is the user's new input, but it is not used in the print statement.
4. **`i`**: This variable is defined as `i + 1`, but we do not know the initial value of `i`. Therefore, we can only express the final value of `i` in terms of its initial value.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```
- **`'?'`**: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- **`maxi`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will refer to it as `maxi`.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` is `i + 1`. Since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we will denote the initial value of `i` as `i_initial`. Therefore, the value of `i` that will be printed is `i_initial + 1`.

### Final Output:
Given the analysis, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? maxi maxi i_initial + 1 i_initial + 1 (where maxi is an undefined variable and i_initial + 1 is the incremented value of i)**
