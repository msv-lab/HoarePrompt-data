Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is 0; `arr` is reset to `[i]` because the user's input was `'<'`; `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is `'<'`.**
