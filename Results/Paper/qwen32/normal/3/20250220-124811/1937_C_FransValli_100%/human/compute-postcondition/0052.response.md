Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is a list with at least two elements. If `res` is `'>'`, `mini` is set to `item`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the first element of `arr`.**
