Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' with an additional 'Draw' appended, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simple terms, the `answers` list now has one more element, 'Draw', added to it. All other variables retain their previous values and constraints.
