Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and now also contains 'Alice', `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simple terms: The value of `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` remains equal to `t`, `clues` remains the same list of integers, `answers` now includes an additional element 'Alice', and `i` has been incremented by 1.
