The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and now includes 'Draw', `i` is `i + 1`.
