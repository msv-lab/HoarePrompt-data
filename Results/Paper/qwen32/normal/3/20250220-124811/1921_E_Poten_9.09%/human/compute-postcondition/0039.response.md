Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and it is not the case that `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`. Additionally, either both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]` and the current value of `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw' if `(clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true, otherwise `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw' if `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, otherwise `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob'.**
