Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`. If `clues[3] == clues[5]`, then `answers` is a list containing the string `'Bob'`. Otherwise, if `clues[3] < clues[5]`, the string `'Draw'` is added to `answers` if either `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. Otherwise, the string `'Bob'` is added to `answers`. If `clues[3] > clues[5]`, the string `'Draw'` is added to `answers` if either `clues[1] - clues[3]` or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, the string `'Bob'` is added to `answers`. If `clues[3]` is not greater than `clues[5]`, no changes are made to `answers`.**
