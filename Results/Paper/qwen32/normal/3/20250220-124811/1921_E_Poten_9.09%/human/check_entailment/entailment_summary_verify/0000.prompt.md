You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads six integers: `h` (height), `w` (width), `x_a`, `y_a` (coordinates of point A), and `x_b`, `y_b` (coordinates of point B). It then determines the outcome for each test case based on the provided coordinates and dimensions, and prints 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Let's analyze the logic and identify potential issues.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Initial Conditions and Moves**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the initial conditions of the game, especially the starting positions and the possible moves for Alice and Bob.
   - The program incorrectly checks conditions based on the parity (even/odd) of the initial positions without considering the actual moves and the structure of the game.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle edge cases, such as when Alice or Bob is already in a position where they can win in the next move or when they are close to the boundaries of the board.
   - For example, the program does not correctly handle cases where Alice or Bob can directly move to the opponent's position in the next turn.

3. **Complexity and Logic**:
   - The logic in the program is overly complex and does not follow a clear and systematic approach to determine the winner.
   - The program uses multiple nested conditions and checks that do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Example of Incorrect Output:

Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2 1 1 2 2
```
- According to the problem description, Alice starts at (1,1) and Bob starts at (2,2). Alice can move to (2,1), (2,2), or (2,3) (but (2,3) is out of bounds). Bob can move to (1,1), (1,2), or (1,3) (but (1,3) is out of bounds).
- Alice can move to (2,2) in one move, capturing Bob's chip and winning the game.
- However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" for this test case.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach to solve this problem involves simulating the game based on the possible moves and determining if Alice or Bob can force a win or if the game will end in a draw. This can be done using a strategy based on the positions and the possible moves, considering the boundaries of the board.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem's requirements and fails to produce the correct output for certain test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
