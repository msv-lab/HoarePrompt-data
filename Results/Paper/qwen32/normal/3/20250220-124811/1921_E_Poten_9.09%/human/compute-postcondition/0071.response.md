The code snippet appends the string `'Draw'` to the `answers` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2] <= clues[4]`, and `clues[0] != 1`. Additionally, one of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` is even and the other is odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1. The current state satisfies the condition that either `clues[5] - 2 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`.**
