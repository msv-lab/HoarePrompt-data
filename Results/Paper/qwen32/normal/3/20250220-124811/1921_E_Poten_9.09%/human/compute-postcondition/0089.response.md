Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' with 'Bob' appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state means that the variable `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, `test_cases` still holds the value of `t`, `clues` retains its list of integers from the input, `answers` now includes an additional element 'Bob', and `i` has been incremented by 1.
