Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and it is not the case that `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`. Additionally, either both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]` and the current value of `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]` with an absolute difference of 1 or less. If `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `answers` is ['Draw']. Otherwise, `answers` is ['Bob'].**
