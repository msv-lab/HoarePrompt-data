Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and it is not the case that `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`. Additionally, either both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`. `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`**
