Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads six integers: `h` (height), `w` (width), `x_a`, `y_a` (coordinates of point A), and `x_b`, `y_b` (coordinates of point B). It then determines the outcome for each test case based on the provided coordinates and dimensions, and prints 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' for each case.**
