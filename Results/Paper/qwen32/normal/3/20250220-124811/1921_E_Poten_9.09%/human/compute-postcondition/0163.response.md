Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is equal to `t` (indicating all iterations are completed), and `answers` is a list containing `t` elements, each either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', determined by the conditions specified in the loop.**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop are completed, `t` remains the same positive integer, `test_cases` is still equal to `t`, and `answers` will contain `t` results, each of which is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', based on the input `clues` for each iteration.
