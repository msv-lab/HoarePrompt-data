Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Let's analyze the logic and identify potential issues.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Initial Conditions and Moves**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the initial conditions of the game, especially the starting positions and the possible moves for Alice and Bob.
   - The program incorrectly checks conditions based on the parity (even/odd) of the initial positions without considering the actual moves and the structure of the game.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle edge cases, such as when Alice or Bob is already in a position where they can win in the next move or when they are close to the boundaries of the board.
   - For example, the program does not correctly handle cases where Alice or Bob can directly move to the opponent's position in the next turn.

3. **Complexity and Logic**:
   - The logic in the program is overly complex and does not follow a clear and systematic approach to determine the winner.
   - The program uses multiple nested conditions and checks that do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Example of Incorrect Output:

Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2 1 1 2 2
```
- According to the problem description, Alice starts at (1,1) and Bob starts at (2,2). Alice can move to (2,1), (2,2), or (2,3) (but (2,3) is out of bounds). Bob can move to (1,1), (1,2), or (1,3) (but (1,3) is out of bounds).
- Alice can move to (2,2) in one move, capturing Bob's chip and winning the game.
- However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" for this test case.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach to solve this problem involves simulating the game based on the possible moves and determining if Alice or Bob can force a win or if the game will end in a draw. This can be done using a strategy based on the positions and the possible moves, considering the boundaries of the board.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem's requirements and fails to produce the correct output for certain test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
