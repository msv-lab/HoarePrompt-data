Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and it is not the case that `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`. Additionally, either both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]` and the current value of `clues[3]` is less than the current value of `clues[5]`. The `answers` list contains either the string 'Draw' or the string 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw' if `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise it contains 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, then `answers` contains 'Draw' if `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise it contains 'Bob'.**
