Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, and `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. If `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, `answers` includes 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` includes 'Bob'.**
