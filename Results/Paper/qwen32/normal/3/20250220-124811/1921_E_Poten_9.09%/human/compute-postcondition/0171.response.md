Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts six integers: `h` (height), `w` (width), `x_a`, `y_a` (coordinates of point A), and `x_b`, `y_b` (coordinates of point B). It returns a value for each test case based on the given coordinates and dimensions. If the coordinates of point A are different from the coordinates of point B, it implies there is a valid pair of points, and the function returns a result accordingly.**
