Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game for all possible scenarios based on the given rules. The logic in the program is overly complex and does not accurately reflect the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Here are some issues and suggestions:

1. **Simplification of the Problem**: The problem can be simplified by observing the relative positions and the number of moves each player can make. If Alice starts above Bob, she can always try to move down towards Bob, and similarly, Bob can move up towards Alice. The key is to determine if Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position.

2. **Parity Consideration**: The program uses parity (even or odd row numbers) to determine the outcome, but this is not a sufficient condition to determine the winner. The parity of the row numbers does not directly correlate with the ability to win the game.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The program needs to calculate the vertical and horizontal distances between Alice and Bob and determine if Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position. This involves considering the number of moves each player can make and their relative positions.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, such as when Alice or Bob is on the first or last row, or when they are in the same column.

A correct approach would involve calculating the minimum number of moves each player needs to reach the other's position and then determining the winner based on these calculations.

Here is a simplified and corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    answers = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b = map(int, input().split())
        if x_a == x_b:
            if y_a == y_b:
                answers.append('Draw')
            elif y_a < y_b:
                if y_b - y_a > 1:
                    answers.append('Draw')
                else:
                    answers.append('Alice' if (x_a % 2 == 1) else 'Bob')
            else:
                if y_a - y_b > 1:
                    answers.append('Draw')
                else:
                    answers.append('Alice' if (x_a % 2 == 0) else 'Bob')
        elif x_a < x_b:
            if abs(x_b - x_a) > 1:
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                if y_a == y_b:
                    answers.append('Alice')
                elif y_a < y_b:
                    if y_b - y_a > 1:
                        answers.append('Draw')
                    else:
                        answers.append('Alice' if (x_a % 2 == 1) else 'Bob')
                else:
                    if y_a - y_b > 1:
                        answers.append('Draw')
                    else:
                        answers.append('Alice' if (x_a % 2 == 0) else 'Bob')
        else:
            if abs(x_a - x_b) > 1:
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                if y_a == y_b:
                    answers.append('Bob')
                elif y_a < y_b:
                    if y_b - y_a > 1:
                        answers.append('Draw')
                    else:
                        answers.append('Alice' if (x_a % 2 == 0) else 'Bob')
                else:
                    if y_a - y_b > 1:
                        answers.append('Draw')
                    else:
                        answers.append('Alice' if (x_a % 2 == 1) else 'Bob')
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)

func()
```

This simplified version considers the relative positions and the number of moves each player can make to determine the winner.
