In the given task, the `print` statement is `print('2 3')`. This statement explicitly prints the string `'2 3'`. 

The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `n`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is given as `print('2 3')`.
2. The string `'2 3'` is a literal and does not depend on any variables.
3. The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are defined in the initial state, but they are not referenced in the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'2 3'`.

Output: **2 3**
