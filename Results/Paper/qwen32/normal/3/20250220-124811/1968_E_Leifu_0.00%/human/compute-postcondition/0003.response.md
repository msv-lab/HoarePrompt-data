The provided initial state includes information about variables `t` and `n`, which represent the number of test cases and an input integer, respectively. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not use these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'1 1'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes `t` and `n`, but these variables are not referenced in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('1 1')`, which means it will output the string `'1 1'` exactly as it is.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t` or `n`, the output will be the string `'1 1'`.

Output: **1 1**
