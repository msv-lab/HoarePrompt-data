### Reasoning:
The given program is supposed to output a set of `n` points on an `n x n` grid that maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points.

Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it achieves the desired goal:

1. **Handling the first two points**: The program always starts by printing "1 1" and "1 2". These points are located in the first row, one next to the other, and their Manhattan distance is 1.

2. **Handling the third point**:
   - If `n == 3`, the program prints "2 3". This point is in the second row and the third column. The Manhattan distances from this point to the previous points are:
     - (1,1) to (2,3): `|1-2| + |1-3| = 3`
     - (1,2) to (2,3): `|1-2| + |2-3| = 2`
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances so far is {0, 1, 2, 3}.

3. **Handling points from the fourth to the nth point**:
   - For `n >= 4`, the program prints "2 4" and then "j j" for `j` ranging from 4 to `n`. These points are on the diagonal starting from (2,4) and going down to (n,n).
   - The point (2,4) will have Manhattan distances to the previous points:
     - (1,1) to (2,4): `|1-2| + |1-4| = 4`
     - (1,2) to (2,4): `|1-2| + |2-4| = 3`
     - (2,3) to (2,4): `|2-2| + |3-4| = 1`
   - The points (4,4) to (n,n) will have Manhattan distances to the previous points including each other, which will contribute to a variety of distances.

However, the program does not guarantee that the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances will be achieved. The pattern of points chosen does not necessarily cover all possible distances efficiently.

For example, for `n = 4`, the points chosen are (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4). This does not yield the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances. A better arrangement could be (1,1), (1,4), (4,1), (4,4), which would yield distances of 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not always produce the optimal solution for maximizing the set of distinct Manhattan distances. Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases.

### Correctness: **False**
