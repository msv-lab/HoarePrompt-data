In this task, we are given an initial state with some variables `t`, `n`, and `i` defined. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('1 2')`, which directly prints the string `'1 2'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` is an integer input.
   - `i` is defined as `k+1`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('1 2')`.
   - This statement prints the string `'1 2'` exactly as it is, without using any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `i`.

3. **Output:**
   - The output is simply the string `'1 2'`.

Given this analysis, the final output is:

Output: **1 2**
