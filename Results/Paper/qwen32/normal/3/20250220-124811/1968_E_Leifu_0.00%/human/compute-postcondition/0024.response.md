Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
- `n` is an integer that must be at least 4.
- `i` is `k+1`.

### Print Statement
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

### Analysis
The print statement concatenates the string representation of the variable `j` with a space and then with the string representation of `j` again. This means the output will be `j j` where `j` is converted to a string.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `j`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical or string value of `j`. The only thing we know is that `j` is being printed twice with a space in between.

### Conclusion
Since the value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `j`.

Output: **j j (where j is the value of the variable j)**
