In the given task, the for loop iterates with the variable `j` ranging from 4 to `n` (inclusive). The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are mentioned in the state, but only `j` is part of the loop head, which means we can only adjust `j` to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `j`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has a value that allowed the loop to execute. Since the loop runs from 4 to `n`, `j` must have been a value in this range.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range [4, `n`].

### Adjustment:
- **Adjust `j`**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we need to increase `j` by 1 from its previous value.
- **Check Range**: Ensure that the new value of `j` is still less than or equal to `n`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`. We need to ensure that `k + 1` is still within the range [4, `n`].

### Final State:
Since `i` is mentioned as `k + 1` in the provided state, it implies that `j` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an integer that must be at least 4; `i` is `k+1`; `j` is `i + 1`**.

However, since `i` is not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted directly, we should express the state in terms of `j`:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an integer that must be at least 4; `j` is `i + 1`**.

Given that `i` was `k + 1` and `j` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, `j` should now be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an integer that must be at least 4; `j` is `k + 2`**.

But to strictly adhere to the loop head variables, the correct state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an integer that must be at least 4; `j` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` is not part of the loop head, the most accurate state considering only the loop head variable `j` is:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an integer that must be at least 4; `j` is `j + 1`**.

However, to match the format and given context, the final state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an integer that must be at least 4; `j` is `i + 1`**.
