The provided initial state describes the setup of the program but does not affect the output of the `print` statement in the given code snippet. The code snippet simply prints the string 'YES' without referencing any of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state mentions that `t` is set to `t - 1`, but this does not influence the output of the `print` statement.
2. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are mentioned as integers provided in the input, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement directly outputs the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
