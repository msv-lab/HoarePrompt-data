The `print('NO')` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state description mentions `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` as integers provided in the input, and `t` is adjusted to `t - 1`. However, these variables are not used in the print statement provided. The print statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Therefore, the print statement will simply output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
