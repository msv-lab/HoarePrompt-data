Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is an integer provided in the input, `x` is an integer provided in the input and must be at least 0, `a` is an integer provided in the input, `z` is \((x + 1) + \frac{(k-1) \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{k-1}\right)^{x+1}\right)}{k-2}\), `i` is `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then no further changes occur. If `a` is less than `z`, then no further changes occur.**
