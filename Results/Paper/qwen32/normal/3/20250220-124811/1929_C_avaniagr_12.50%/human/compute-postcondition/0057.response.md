The code snippet reassigns the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` based on the input. The initial state mentions that `t` is `t - 1`, but since `t` is not involved in the provided code snippet, its value remains unchanged. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are reassigned to the integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input.**
In natural language: The value of `t` remains `t - 1` as it was initially. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated to the integers provided in the input.
