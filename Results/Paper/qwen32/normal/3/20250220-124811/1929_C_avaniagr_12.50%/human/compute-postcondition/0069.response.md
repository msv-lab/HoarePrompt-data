The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, so for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `x` does not need to be adjusted as it is the upper limit for the loop.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is an integer provided in the input, `x` is an integer provided in the input and must be at least 0, `a` is an integer provided in the input, `z` is 2, `i` is 2**
