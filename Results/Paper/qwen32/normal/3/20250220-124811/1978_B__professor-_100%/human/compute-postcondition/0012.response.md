The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Since `_` does not affect the state of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is `t` is greater than 0, we need to decrement `t` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then no further changes are made to `n`, `a`, or `b`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a`, and if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`. If `b - a` is less than `n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.**
