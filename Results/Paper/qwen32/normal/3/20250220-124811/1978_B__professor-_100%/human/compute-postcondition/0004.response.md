The given code snippet is `print(n * a)`. To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the variables involved:

- `n` is an integer.
- `a` is an integer.
- `t` is greater than 0, but it is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `b` is less than or equal to `a`, but it is also not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.

The expression `n * a` represents the product of `n` and `a`. Since we do not have explicit values for `n` and `a`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n * a (where n is an integer and a is an integer)**
