Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function is called `t` times, with `t` being the number of test cases provided first. For each test case, the function returns a value based on the provided integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
