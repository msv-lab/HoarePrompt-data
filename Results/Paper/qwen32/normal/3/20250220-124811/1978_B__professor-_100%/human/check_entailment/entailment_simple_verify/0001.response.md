### Reasoning:
The original assessment appears to be accurate. Let's break down the logic and verify it step-by-step based on the problem description and the annotated code:

1. **Case 1: \( b \le a \)**
   - If the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), selling any buns at the modified price would yield less profit than selling them at the usual price. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - Total profit = \( n \times a \).
   - The code correctly implements this as `print(n * a)`.

2. **Case 2: \( b - a \ge n \)**
   - If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the number of buns \( n \), it is optimal to sell all \( n \) buns at the modified prices starting from \( b \) down to \( b - n + 1 \). This ensures a higher profit because the price reduction per bun is less than the number of buns.
   - Total profit = Sum of an arithmetic series from \( b \) to \( b - n + 1 \) = \( \frac{n \times (2b - n + 1)}{2} \).
   - The code correctly implements this as `print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))`.

3. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \)**
   - If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is less than the number of buns \( n \), it is optimal to sell \( b - a \) buns at the modified prices and the remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - Total profit = Sum of an arithmetic series from \( b \) to \( a + 1 \) + \( a \times (n - (b - a)) \) = \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n \).
   - The code correctly implements this as `print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))`.

The annotations and the original assessment correctly identify and handle all possible scenarios. The program logic is consistent with the problem description, and the annotations validate the correctness of the code.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns.

Final: **True**
