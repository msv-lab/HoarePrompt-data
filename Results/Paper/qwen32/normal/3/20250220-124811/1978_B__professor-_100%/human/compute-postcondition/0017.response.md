Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integers read from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `n`, `a`, or `b`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`. If `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a` is less than `n`, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the program after the if-else block executes, covering all the specified conditions and outcomes.
