In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that is not used within the loop body. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned before the loop, but they are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1, because the loop will execute `t` times.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
