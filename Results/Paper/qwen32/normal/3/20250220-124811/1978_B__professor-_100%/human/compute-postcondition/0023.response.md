To determine what will be printed by the given print statement, let's break down the expression step by step:

The print statement is:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

Here's the breakdown of the expression:

1. **`(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`**: This part of the expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `a` to `b`. The formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Here, `k` is `(b - a)`, so this part calculates the sum of numbers from `a` to `b`.

2. **`a * n`**: This part of the expression multiplies the first term `a` by `n`.

3. **The entire expression**: The sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` is added to the product of `a` and `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1 (not directly used in the print statement).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.

Let's describe the output in terms of `a`, `b`, and `n`:

- `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of all integers from `a` to `b` inclusive.
- `a * n` adds `a` multiplied by `n` to this sum.

Final output:
Output: **the sum of all integers from `a` to `b` inclusive plus `a * n`** (where `a`, `b`, and `n` are the integers read from the input).
