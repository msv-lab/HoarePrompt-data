You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
Bob needs to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins each, where `i` ranges from 1 to `k`, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` coins each. We need to find the optimal `k` to maximize the profit.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the maximum profit based on the given conditions.

### Key Points to Verify
1. **Case 1:** `b <= a` - In this case, the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns should be sold at the usual price `a`.
2. **Case 2:** `b - a >= n` - Here, the benefit from selling the first `n` buns at the modified price is greater than or equal to the usual price, so all `n` buns should be sold at the modified price.
3. **Case 3:** `b - a < n` - In this scenario, we need to calculate the optimal `k` to maximize the profit. The program seems to be incorrectly calculating this case.

### Correctness Check
Let's analyze the provided program for correctness.

#### Case 1: `b <= a`
- The program correctly returns `n * a` as the profit.

#### Case 2: `b - a >= n`
- The program correctly returns the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and ending at `b - n + 1`, which is given by the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

#### Case 3: `b - a < n`
- The provided formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` is incorrect. This formula does not correctly compute the maximum profit for this case. The correct approach would be to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.

### Counterexample for Case 3
Consider the test case:
```
1
3 3 5
```
- According to the problem, the optimal `k` would be 2:
  - Selling 2 buns at modified prices: `5 + 4 = 9`
  - Selling 1 bun at usual price: `3`
  - Total profit: `9 + 3 = 12`
- The program calculates the profit as `(5 - 3) * (5 - 3 + 1) // 2 + 3 * 3 = 2 * 3 // 2 + 9 = 3 + 9 = 12`, which is correct in this case, but this is not a general solution.

However, let's consider another test case:
```
1
4 4 5
```
- The optimal `k` would be 1:
  - Selling 1 bun at modified price: `5`
  - Selling 3 buns at usual price: `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
  - Total profit: `5 + 12 = 17`
- The program calculates the profit as `(5 - 4) * (5 - 4 + 1) // 2 + 4 * 4 = 1 * 2 // 2 + 16 = 1 + 16 = 17`, which is correct in this case, but again, this is not a general solution.

The program does not correctly handle the general case for `b - a < n`. The correct approach would involve calculating the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence and comparing it with the profit from selling all buns at the usual price.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, specifically the case where `b - a < n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum profit for the case where `b - a < n`. It incorrectly calculates the profit using a formula that does not account for the optimal `k` to maximize the profit.
