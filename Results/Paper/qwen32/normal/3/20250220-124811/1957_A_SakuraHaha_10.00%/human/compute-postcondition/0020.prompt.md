You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The total number of test cases is given by the first integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) in the input.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (with `n` ≥ 1), `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their respective counts as values.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (with `n` ≥ 1), `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for all `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their respective counts as values.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of (count of each unique stick length) // 4 for all unique stick lengths in the list `a`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The function processes each test case and returns a value indicating whether it is possible to form a triangle using any three of the sticks from the given lengths. If it is possible to form a triangle, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
