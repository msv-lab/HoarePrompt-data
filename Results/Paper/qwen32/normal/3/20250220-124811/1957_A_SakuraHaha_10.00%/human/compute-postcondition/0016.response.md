Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (with `n` ≥ 1), `ans` is `ans` + `x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one unique stick length as a key and its respective count as a value, `x` is the next value in `cnt.values()`. The value of `ans` has been incremented by the integer division of `x` by 4.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been increased by the result of `x // 4`, where `x` is the count of a specific stick length from the dictionary `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
