You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The total number of test cases is given by the first integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) in the input.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (with `n` ≥ 1), `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their respective counts as values.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (with `n` ≥ 1), `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for all `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their respective counts as values.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of (count of each unique stick length) // 4 for all unique stick lengths in the list `a`)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only considers the possibility of forming squares (polygons with 4 sides) and does not account for forming other regular polygons such as triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc. 

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3
3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation: With three sticks of length 3, we can form an equilateral triangle (a regular polygon with 3 sides).

However, the provided program will output `0` for this input because it only checks for the number of squares that can be formed (i.e., it checks how many times a stick can form groups of 4).

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the general case of forming any regular polygon, only squares.
