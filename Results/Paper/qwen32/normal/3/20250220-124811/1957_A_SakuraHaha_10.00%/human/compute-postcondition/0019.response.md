Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The function processes each test case and returns a value indicating whether it is possible to form a triangle using any three of the sticks from the given lengths. If it is possible to form a triangle, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".**
