To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **t**: The number of test cases. It ranges from 1 to 100.
2. **n**: The number of sticks. It ranges from 1 to 100.
3. **a**: A list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks.
4. **cnt**: A dictionary where each unique stick length is a key, and the value is the count of how many times that length appears in the list `a`.
5. **ans**: The sum of `x // 4` for all `x` in `cnt.values()`, where `x` represents the count of each unique stick length.

The `ans` variable is calculated by iterating over the counts of each unique stick length in the `cnt` dictionary and performing integer division by 4 on each count. The results of these divisions are then summed up.

Since the exact values of `a` and `cnt` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the calculation process and the output in terms of the given variables.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialize `cnt`**: Count the occurrences of each stick length in the list `a`.
2. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - For each unique stick length in `cnt`, get its count `x`.
   - Compute `x // 4` (integer division of `x` by 4).
   - Sum all these results to get `ans`.

### Output Description:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique stick length by 4.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of (count of each unique stick length) // 4 for all unique stick lengths in the list `a`)**
