You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code:

    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The total number of test cases is given by the first integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) in the input.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (with `n` ≥ 1), `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their respective counts as values.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (with `n` ≥ 1), `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for all `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their respective counts as values.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of (count of each unique stick length) // 4 for all unique stick lengths in the list `a`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. It calculates how many sets of four sticks can be formed from each test case and prints the total number of such sets for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from a given set of sticks, where each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick and no stick can be reused. Regular polygons are defined by having all sides of equal length.

### Key Points:
1. **Regular Polygons**: The smallest regular polygon is a triangle (3 sides), but the problem implicitly assumes that the smallest polygon that can be formed is a square (4 sides) since the solution code counts in multiples of 4.
2. **Stick Usage**: Each stick can be used in exactly one polygon, and no breaking of sticks is allowed.
3. **Input Structure**: The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of stick lengths.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks and their lengths.
3. It counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary.
4. For each unique stick length, it calculates how many complete squares (4-sided polygons) can be formed using the sticks of that length.
5. It sums these counts to get the total number of polygons that can be formed.
6. It outputs the total count for each test case.

### Issues and Correctness:
- The program assumes that the smallest polygon is a square (4 sides). This is a reasonable assumption given the solution logic, but it might not align with the problem's intention if it allows polygons with fewer sides (like triangles).
- The program correctly counts the number of complete squares that can be formed from each stick length, which is the core task.
- The logic of the program is consistent with the problem's requirements for forming regular polygons using the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons (specifically squares) that can be formed with the given sticks. Given the assumptions and constraints, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
