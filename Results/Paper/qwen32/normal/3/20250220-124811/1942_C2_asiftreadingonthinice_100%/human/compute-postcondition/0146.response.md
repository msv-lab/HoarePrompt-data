Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are input integers. `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`. If `y >= i - 1`, then `y` is further decreased by `i - 1` and `ans` is incremented by `i`. If `y < i - 1`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans` is adjusted based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. `ii` is incremented by `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two elements such that `a[1] - a[0]` is even and not equal to 2, and `tmp` includes `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. `tmp` is sorted in ascending order.**
