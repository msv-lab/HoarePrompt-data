The value of `ans` is updated to be its initial value plus 7 plus `y`. Since `y` is defined as the initial value minus 4, the new value of `ans` can be expressed as the initial value plus 7 plus (initial value minus 4), which simplifies to the initial value plus the initial value plus 3, or 2 times the initial value plus 3. The value of `y` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 2 times the initial value plus 3, `y` is the initial value minus 4**.
