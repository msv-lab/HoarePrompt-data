The provided code snippet attempts to append a value to a list named `tmp`. However, in the initial state, `tmp` is not defined as a list. Assuming `tmp` was intended to be a list and was initialized before this code snippet, the code will add the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to `tmp`.

Given the initial state:
- `tt` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input.
- `y` is the third integer from the input.
- `ii` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input and sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 3.
- If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, if `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0`, `tmp` contains the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.

The code snippet modifies `tmp` by appending `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to it.

Output State: **`tt` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `ii` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements; `i` is 3; `tmp` contains the previous values plus the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**
