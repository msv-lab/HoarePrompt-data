The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `ans`, `y`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation. The only change is in the list `a`, which is now sorted.

Output State: **`ans` is 2 times the initial value plus 3, `y` is the third input integer, `ii` is 4, `tt` must be greater than 4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**
