The code snippet appends a value to the list `tmp`. The value is calculated as `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, where `i` is initially 2. This means the code calculates the integer division of the difference between the second and first elements of the sorted list `a` and appends this result to `tmp`.

Given that `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and has at least 2 elements, and `i` is 2, the specific value appended to `tmp` will be `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.

Output State: **`tt` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `ii` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `tmp` contains the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.**
