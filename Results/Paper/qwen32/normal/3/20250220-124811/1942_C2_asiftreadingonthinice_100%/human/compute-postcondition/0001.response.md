The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, which is the loop variable for the `range(tt)`. The loop will execute if `tt` is at least 1. The other variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `tt` is greater than or equal to 1. The other variables can remain as they are described in the problem statement.

State: **`tt` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `ii` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0**.
