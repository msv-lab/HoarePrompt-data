Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `ii`, `a` are as described in the precondition; `ans` is initialized to `x + y - 2` plus the count of pairs with difference 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. `tmp` is a sorted list of `(a[i] - a[i-1]) // 2` for even differences not equal to 2. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2, then `tmp` includes `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is any value, `t` is any value, `n` is 10, `x` is any value, `y` is any value, `ii` is any value, `a` is `[1, 5, 9]`, and `tmp` is `[2, 2]`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `ii - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - i + 1` and `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2` plus the count of pairs with difference 2 plus `i`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged and `ans` remains `x + y - 2` plus the count of pairs with difference 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is any value, `t` is any value, `n` is 10, `x` is any value, `ii` is any value, `a` is `[1, 5, 9]`, `tmp` is `[2, 2, 3]`, and `i` is 3. If `y` is greater than or equal to 2, then `y` is decreased by 2 and `ans` is increased by 3. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `y` or `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` is any value, `t` is any value, `n` is 10, `x` is any value, `ii` is any value, `a` is `[1, 5, 9]`, `tmp` is `[2, 2, 3]`, and `i` is 2. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by 2 and `y` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans` and `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
