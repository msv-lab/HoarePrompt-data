Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output state:

Initial State:
- `n` and `x` remain unchanged.
- `y` is reduced by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp` that were processed.
- `ans` is incremented by the sum of all `i` in `tmp` that were processed.
- `ii` is incremented by `len(a) - 1` for each iteration of the loop.
- `tt` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains the same sorted list of integers.
- `tmp` remains the same list of differences.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
ans += y
```

This code snippet simply adds the value of `y` to `ans`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. 

Given this, the output state will be:
- `ans` will be the original value of `ans` plus the value of `y`.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `ii`, `tt`, `a`, `tmp`) will remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `x` remain unchanged; `y` is reduced by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp` that were processed; `ans` is incremented by `y` plus the sum of all `i` in `tmp` that were processed; `ii` is incremented by `len(a) - 1` for each iteration of the loop; `tt` remains unchanged; `a` remains the same sorted list of integers; `tmp` remains the same list of differences.**

Natural language explanation:
The value of `ans` is now the original value of `ans` plus the value of `y`. All other variables remain in their previously described states.
