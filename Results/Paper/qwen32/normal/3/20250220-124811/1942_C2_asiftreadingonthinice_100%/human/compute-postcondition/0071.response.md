Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x + y - 2`. `y` is the third input integer, `ii` is 5, `tt` is greater than 4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least 2 elements. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` includes `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` as its last element. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.**
