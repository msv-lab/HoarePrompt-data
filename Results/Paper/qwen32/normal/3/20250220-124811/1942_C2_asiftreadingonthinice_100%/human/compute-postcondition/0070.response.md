The code snippet appends the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that the initial state specifies that `tmp` is either an empty list or contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` under certain conditions, executing this code will definitely add another value to `tmp`.

The values of `ans`, `y`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, and the sorted list `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x + y - 2`. `y` is the third input integer, `ii` is 5, `tt` is greater than 4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least 2 elements, and `tmp` is a list that includes `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` as its last element.**
