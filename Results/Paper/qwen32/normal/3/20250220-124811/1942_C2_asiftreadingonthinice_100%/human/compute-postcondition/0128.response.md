The given code snippet appends a calculated value to the `tmp` list. Specifically, it calculates `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` and appends this value to `tmp`. This calculation is based on the current value of `i`, which is assumed to have been incremented before this line of code is executed.

Here's the impact on the variables:
- `tmp` will now include an additional element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `ans`, `ii`, `tt`, `a`) remain unchanged in terms of their values and the conditions described for them.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is `x + y`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 1`. `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two elements, and `tmp` includes `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, plus the newly appended value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
