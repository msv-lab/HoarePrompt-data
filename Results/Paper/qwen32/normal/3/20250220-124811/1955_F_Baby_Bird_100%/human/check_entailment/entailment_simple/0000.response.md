To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and see if it aligns with the problem description and the provided example outputs.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of times Bob can win, which happens when the XOR of the remaining numbers in the sequence is zero. Here's the key insight:

- XOR of two identical numbers is zero.
- XOR of a number with itself an even number of times is zero.
- XOR of a number with itself an odd number of times is the number itself.

The numbers in the sequence can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The XOR of a sequence of numbers will be zero if the count of each number having an odd contribution to the XOR is even (since XOR is commutative and associative).

### Strategy to Maximize Bob's Wins

To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has an even count of numbers contributing an odd XOR value. The numbers 1 and 3 contribute an odd XOR value, while 2 and 4 contribute an even XOR value (since 2 and 4 are even numbers, their XOR with themselves any number of times will be even).

### Deriving the Formula

Given `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`:
- `p1` and `p3` contribute to the XOR if they are odd.
- `p2` and `p4` do not affect the parity of the XOR since they are even.

The goal is to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero. This happens when the count of `1`s and `3`s that contribute to the XOR is even.

The formula used in the program:
```python
sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))
```
- `x // 2` gives the number of pairs of `x`, which can be removed while keeping the parity of the count of `1`s and `3`s.
- `x % 2` gives the remainder when `x` is divided by 2, which is the count of numbers that cannot be paired.
- `(i < 3)` ensures that only `1`s and `3`s (indexed 0 and 2) are considered for the remainder term.

The total is then divided by 3 to get the number of games Bob can win.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the first example:
- Input: `1 1 1 0`
- Calculation:
  - `1 // 2 = 0`, `1 % 2 = 1` (for `1`s)
  - `1 // 2 = 0`, `1 % 2 = 1` (for `2`s)
  - `1 // 2 = 0`, `1 % 2 = 1` (for `3`s)
  - `0 // 2 = 0`, `0 % 2 = 0` (for `4`s)
  - Sum: `0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3`
  - Result: `3 // 3 = 1`
- Output: `1` (Bob wins once)

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the program is correct.

Reasoning: The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the parity of the counts of `1`s and `3`s and ensuring that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as many times as possible.
Correctness: **True**
