You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a result based on these counts and prints the result for each test case, separated by newlines.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the program is correct, we need to analyze the problem and the given solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win in a game where the winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of the numbers in a sequence. The numbers in the sequence can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Bob wins if the XOR of the numbers is zero.

The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if for each bit position, there is an even number of numbers contributing a 1 to that bit position. Here's how the numbers contribute to the XOR:
- 1 contributes 1 to the least significant bit (LSB).
- 2 contributes 1 to the second least significant bit (2nd LSB).
- 3 contributes 1 to both the LSB and the 2nd LSB.
- 4 contributes 1 to the third least significant bit (3rd LSB).

To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers such that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as many times as possible. Specifically, Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the counts of numbers contributing to each bit position are even.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution uses a mathematical approach to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Let's break down the logic:
- For each bit position, calculate how many numbers contribute a 1 to that bit position.
- The maximum number of times Bob can win is determined by how many times we can remove numbers such that the counts of numbers contributing to each bit position are even.

The formula used in the solution is:
\[ \text{sum}((3 \times (\text{count} // 2) + \text{count} \% 2 \times (\text{bit position} < 3)) \text{ for each bit position}) // 3 \]

Here's what this formula does:
- For each count of numbers (corresponding to the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4), calculate how many times we can remove pairs of numbers (which keeps the XOR even) plus an additional number if the count is odd and the bit position is less than 3 (since 4 does not contribute to the first two bits).
- Sum these values for all bit positions.
- Divide the sum by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

1. **Test Case:** `1 1 1 0`
   - Numbers: 1, 2, 3
   - XOR is non-zero initially.
   - Eve can remove one of the numbers to make the XOR zero.
   - Maximum times Bob can win: 1

2. **Test Case:** `1 0 1 2`
   - Numbers: 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4
   - XOR is non-zero initially.
   - Eve can remove one 1 and one 3 to make the XOR zero.
   - Maximum times Bob can win: 1

3. **Test Case:** `2 2 2 0`
   - Numbers: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3
   - XOR is zero initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs to keep the XOR zero.
   - Maximum times Bob can win: 3

4. **Test Case:** `3 3 2 0`
   - Numbers: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3
   - XOR is non-zero initially.
   - Eve can remove numbers to make the XOR zero.
   - Maximum times Bob can win: 3

5. **Test Case:** `0 9 9 9`
   - Numbers: 2, 2, ..., 2, 3, 3, ..., 3, 4, 4, ..., 4 (9 times each)
   - XOR is zero initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs to keep the XOR zero.
   - Maximum times Bob can win: 12

The solution correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.
