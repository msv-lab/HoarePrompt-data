Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, we calculate the new state as follows:

The code modifies the value of `cnt` based on the current values of `x` and `y`. The expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` determines the increment for `cnt`. Here, `math.ceil(x / y)` computes the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y`, and `(x % y == 0)` evaluates to `1` if `x` is exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., no remainder), otherwise it evaluates to `0`.

The initial state specifies that `cnt` is `-1`, and `x` and `y` are defined as `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, respectively. The code does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, or `y`, only `cnt`.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0); `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`.**
