### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is correctly implemented and can be used to find the GCD of two numbers.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given `n` and `m`.
   - The implementation of `func_2` seems incorrect. Let's break down the logic:
     - `cnt` is initialized to -1, which is unusual for a counter.
     - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
     - For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
     - It then increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
   - The logic of this function does not match the problem's requirements. It is not correctly counting the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

Let's analyze the annotated version of the code to understand the behavior of `func_2`:

```python
#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: `cnt` is updated to `-1 + sum(math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0) for i in range(1, m + 1))
    return cnt
    #The program returns `cnt` which is updated to `-1 + sum(math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0) for i in range(1, m + 1))`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `m`, and returns a count `cnt` which is calculated based on a summation involving the ceiling of a division and a condition check for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`. Specifically, for each `i`, it computes a value and accumulates it into `cnt`, which is then adjusted by subtracting 1 from the total sum.
```

The logic in `func_2` is not aligned with the problem statement. The problem requires checking pairs (a, b) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, `func_2` does not perform this check. Instead, it performs a different computation that does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in `func_2` does not align with the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
