The variable `x` is assigned the value of `n - (i * i - i)`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are positive integers within the specified range. The variable `cnt` remains -1 as it is not affected by the given code snippet. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown, but the expression for `x` includes it.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is -1; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**
