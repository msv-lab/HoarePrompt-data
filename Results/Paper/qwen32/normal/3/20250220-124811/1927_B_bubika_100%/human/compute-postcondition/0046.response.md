The code snippet `r += a[x]` adds the value of `a[x]` to the current value of `r`. Given the initial state, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, and `s` is a new list of integers obtained from space-separated input values.

Since `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`, `a[x]` refers to the element in list `a` at the same index `x`. The value of `r` will be updated to its current value plus this element.

Output State: **`s` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 element; `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`; `r` is updated to its current value plus `a[x]`.**
