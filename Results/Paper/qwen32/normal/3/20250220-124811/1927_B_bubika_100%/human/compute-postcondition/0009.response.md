The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` of the list `b` by 1. Given that `x` is 0, the value at index 0 of `b` will be incremented from 0 to 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `b` is a list where the first element is 1 and the remaining 25 elements are 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 element; `r` is the string representation of `s[0]`; `x` is 0**.
