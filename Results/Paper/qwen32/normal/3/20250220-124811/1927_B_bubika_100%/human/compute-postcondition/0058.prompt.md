Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, there exists a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    b = [0] * 26
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `b` is a list where each element at index `x` represents the count of the number `x` in the list `s`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `r` is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `a` corresponding to each number in `s`; `x` is the index of the last element in `s` in the list `b`; `i` is the last element in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t + 1`, `b` is a list of 26 zeros except `b[0]` which is `len(s)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `r` is `a[0] * len(s)`, `x` is `0`, `i` is the last element in the new `s`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is [0, 1, 2], `b` is [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 'abc', `x` is 2, `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
