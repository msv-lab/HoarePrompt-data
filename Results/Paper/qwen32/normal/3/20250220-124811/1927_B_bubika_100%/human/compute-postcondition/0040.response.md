The code snippet `b = [0] * 26` resets the list `b` to a new list of 26 zeros, disregarding its previous state where `b[0]` was `len(s)` and all other elements were zeros.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `r` is `a[0] * len(s)`, `x` is `0`, `i` is the last element in the new `s`**.
