The code snippet increments the value at index `x` in the list `b` by 1. Therefore, the value of `b[x]` changes, while other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the operation.

Output State: **`s` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 2 elements; `i` is the next element in the list `s`; `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`; `b[x]` is increased by 1; `r` is increased by `a[x]`.**

In simpler terms, the value at the position `x` in the list `b` is incremented by 1, and `r` is increased by the value of `a[x]`. All other variables retain their original values.
