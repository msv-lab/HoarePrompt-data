The code snippet provided uses the `bisect_left` function to find the insertion point for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`. This insertion point is stored in the variable `eli`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`.
- `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes.
- `s` will be the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e` will be the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `num` will be `nums[N]`, which is `-1`.
- `arr` will contain tuples representing the segments of `nums`.
- `LA` will be `len(arr) - 1`.
- `l` and `r` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input.
- `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`.

The only variable that changes after executing the given code snippet is `eli`, which is now the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the sorted list `arr`.

Output State: **`N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`; `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes; `s` will be the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `e` will be the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `num` will be `nums[N]`, which is `-1`; `arr` will contain tuples representing the segments of `nums`; `LA` will be `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input; `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`.**
