The code snippet appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `s` is 0, `i` is 1, and `num` is `nums[0]`. Therefore, the tuple that gets appended will be `(1 + 0, 1, nums[0])`, which simplifies to `(1, 1, nums[0])`.

The values of `N`, `i`, `s`, and `num` remain unchanged by this operation. Only the list `arr` is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer that must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `num` is `nums[0]`, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])`.**
