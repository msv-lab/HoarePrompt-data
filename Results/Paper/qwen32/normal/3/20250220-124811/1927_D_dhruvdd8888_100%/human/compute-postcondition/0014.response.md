The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `N` is at least 0, `s` is 0, and `num` is `nums[0]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The value of `N` remains the same.

State: **`N` is an integer that must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `num` is `nums[0]`**
