Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`; `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes; `s` will be the index of the last element in `nums` that was different from the previous element; `num` will be `nums[N]`, which is `-1`; `arr` will contain tuples representing the segments of `nums`; `LA` will be `len(arr) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1 or s > r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N or e < l:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`; `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes; `s` will be the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `e` will be the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `num` will be `nums[N]`, which is `-1`; `arr` will contain tuples representing the segments of `nums`; `LA` will be `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input; `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`. If `s > l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `r`. If `s > l` and `s` is `1` or `s > r`, then `s` satisfies the condition `s == 1 or s > r`. Otherwise, `s > l` and `s` is less than or equal to `r`. If `s <= l`, then `e` is either greater than or equal to `r` or less than `r` depending on the condition. Specifically, if `e >= r`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`; otherwise, `e` is less than `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`; `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes; `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `num` is `nums[N]`, which is `-1`; `arr` contains tuples representing the segments of `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input; `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`. The behavior does not change whether the condition `s > l` is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`; `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes; `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `num` is `nums[N]`, which is `-1`; `arr` contains tuples representing the segments of `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are the new values from the input; `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`. The if-else block does not alter any of the variables based on the given conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
