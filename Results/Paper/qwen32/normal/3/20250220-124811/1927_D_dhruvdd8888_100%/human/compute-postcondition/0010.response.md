The code snippet appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple contains three elements: `1 + s`, `i`, and `num`. Since `i` is 0 and `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, the value of `i` remains 0. The value of `N` is not affected by this operation. The value of `s` is not specified, so `1 + s` remains as `1 + s`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer that must be at least 0, `i` is 0, and `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`. The list `arr` has an additional element `(1 + s, 0, num)`.**
