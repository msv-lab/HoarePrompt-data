The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs two values: `-1` and `-1`. Let's analyze the initial state and the code to determine what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `N` is the initial length of the array `a`.
- `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes.
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `num` is `nums[N]`, which is `-1`.
- `arr` contains tuples representing the segments of `nums`.
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `l` and `r` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input.
- `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`. The values of the variables `N`, `i`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, and `eli` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement explicitly specifies the values to be printed.

**Output:**
Output: **-1, -1**
