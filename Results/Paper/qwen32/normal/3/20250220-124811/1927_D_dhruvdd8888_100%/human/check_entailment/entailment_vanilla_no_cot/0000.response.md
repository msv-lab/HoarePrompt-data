Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not produce the correct output for the given problem description. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Use of `bisect_left`**: The `bisect_left` function is used to find the position to insert a new element in a sorted list to maintain order. However, the way it is used here doesn't correctly identify the segment of the array that corresponds to the query range `[l, r]`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Pairs**: The logic for finding pairs of different elements within the query range `[l, r]` is flawed. The code does not correctly identify the first and last segments of the array within the range `[l, r]` and does not handle the case where there are multiple segments correctly.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle cases where the query range `[l, r]` consists of elements that are all the same. It should correctly output `-1 -1` in such cases.

4. **Appending `-1` to `nums`**: Appending `-1` to `nums` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the code that should work correctly for the problem:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q = int(input())
    
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split())
        l -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        r -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        
        # Find the first two different elements in the range [l, r]
        first = nums[l]
        found_second = False
        for i in range(l + 1, r + 1):
            if nums[i] != first:
                print(l + 1, i + 1)  # Output 1-based indices
                found_second = True
                break
        
        if not found_second:
            print(-1, -1)
```

This code correctly handles the problem by iterating through the query range `[l, r]` and finding the first two different elements. If no such elements are found, it outputs `-1 -1`.
