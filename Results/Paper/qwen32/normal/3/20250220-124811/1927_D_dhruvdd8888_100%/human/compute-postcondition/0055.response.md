To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(s, e + 1)`, let's break down the given initial state and identify the relevant values.

### Given Initial State:
1. **`N`**: The initial length of the array `a`, which remains the same.
2. **`i`**: Will be `N` after the loop finishes.
3. **`s`**: The first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
4. **`e`**: The second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
5. **`num`**: `nums[N]`, which is `-1`.
6. **`arr`**: Contains tuples representing the segments of `nums`.
7. **`LA`**: `len(arr) - 1`.
8. **`l` and `r`**: Two integers from the input.
9. **`eli`**: The index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `s` is derived from the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- The variable `e` is derived from the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- The `print` statement will output `s` and `e + 1`.

### Determining `s` and `e`:
- `eli` is the insertion index for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`. This means `eli` is the position in the sorted list `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would fit.
- `LA` is the last index of `arr` (i.e., `len(arr) - 1`).
- `min(eli, LA)` ensures that we do not go out of bounds of `arr`.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can only describe the print statement in terms of the given variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print(s, e + 1)` statement will print:
- `s`, which is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e + 1`, where `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

Thus, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and e is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
