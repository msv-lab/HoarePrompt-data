To determine the output of the `print(s - 1, s)` statement, we need to understand the values of `s` and `s - 1` based on the provided initial state.

1. **Identify `s`**:
   - `s` is defined as the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last valid index of the `arr` list.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain a sorted order.

2. **Determine the value of `min(eli, LA)`**:
   - Since `eli` is the insertion index for `(l, 0, 0)`, it could be any value from `0` to `LA + 1`.
   - `min(eli, LA)` ensures that we do not exceed the bounds of the `arr` list. If `eli` is greater than `LA`, it will be capped at `LA`.

3. **Extract the first element of the tuple at `min(eli, LA)`**:
   - The first element of the tuple at this index is `s`.

4. **Calculate `s - 1`**:
   - Once `s` is known, `s - 1` is simply one less than `s`.

Given that the exact values of `arr`, `l`, and the sorted order are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of `s`:

- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `s - 1` is one less than `s`.

Thus, the output will be `s - 1` followed by `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
