To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, e + 1)` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `N`: The initial length of the array `a`. This remains constant.
   - `i`: Will be `N` after the loop finishes.
   - `s`: The first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e`: The second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `num`: `nums[N]`, which is `-1`.
   - `arr`: Contains tuples representing the segments of `nums`.
   - `LA`: `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r`: New values from the input.
   - `eli`: The index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`.

2. **Key to the output:**
   - The `print(s, e + 1)` statement will print the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and the second element of that tuple plus one.

3. **Understanding `min(eli, LA)`:**
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `LA` is the last index of `arr` (i.e., `len(arr) - 1`).

4. **Determining the exact values:**
   - Since we don't have the exact values of `eli` and `LA`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`.

5. **Constructing the output:**
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `e + 1` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` plus one.

Given the above analysis, the output can be described as:

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and e is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
