The code snippet assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. The values of `N`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. The condition related to the list `arr` does not affect the current state as the code only updates `num`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer that must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `num` is `nums[0]`.**
