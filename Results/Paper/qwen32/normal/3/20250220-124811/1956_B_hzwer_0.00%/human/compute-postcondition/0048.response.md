Output State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. The specific value of `dp[1][n - 3]` is now `max(dp[2][n - 3], dp[3][n - 4] + 1)`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 3`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

In plain language: The value of `dp[1][n - 3]` has been updated to be the maximum of `dp[2][n - 3]` and `dp[3][n - 4] + 1`. All other parts of the initial state remain the same.
