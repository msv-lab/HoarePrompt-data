The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum value between `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Given that `cards.count(j + 1)` is equal to 1, this implies that the card with the value `j + 1` appears exactly once in the `cards` list. This detail does not directly affect the calculation of `dp[i][j]` in this specific line of code, but it is part of the initial state and remains valid.

Output State: **`dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. The value of `dp[i][j]` is now `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all values updated according to the loop's logic. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards.count(j + 1)` is equal to 1.**
