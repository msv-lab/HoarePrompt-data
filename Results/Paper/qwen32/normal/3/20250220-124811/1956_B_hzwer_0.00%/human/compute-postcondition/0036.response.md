Postcondition: **`dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all values updated according to the loop's logic. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `cards.count(j + 1)` is not equal to 1.**
