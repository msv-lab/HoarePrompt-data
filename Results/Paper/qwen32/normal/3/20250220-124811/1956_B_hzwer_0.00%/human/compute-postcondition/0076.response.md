Output State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. Specifically, for each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, if `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[0][j]` is equal to `dp[1][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[0][j]` is `max(dp[1][j], dp[2][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum of `dp[1][j]`, `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[1][j + 1]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is `0`, and `j` has iterated from `n - 1` down to `0`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `dp` table is completely filled in such a way that `dp[0][j]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected for each card type `j+1` considering the rules provided. The loop starts with `i` set to `n - 3` and iterates down to `0`, and for each `i`, it processes each `j` from `n - 1` down to `0`, updating the `dp` table accordingly.
