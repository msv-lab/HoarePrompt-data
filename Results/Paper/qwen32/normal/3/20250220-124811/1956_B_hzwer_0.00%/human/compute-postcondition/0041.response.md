Output State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 1]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][n - 1]` is `max(dp[2][n - 1], dp[3][n - 2] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][n - 1]` is the maximum of `dp[2][n - 1]`, `dp[3][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[2][n]`. The value of `dp[1][n - 2]` is now equal to `dp[2][n - 2]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 2`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

In simple terms, the value of `dp[1][n - 2]` has been updated to be equal to `dp[2][n - 2]`, while all other conditions and values remain the same.
