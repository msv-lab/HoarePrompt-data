Postcondition: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. Specifically, `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` is updated to `max(dp[n - 2][n - 3], dp[n - 1][n - 4] + 1)` if `cards.count(n - 2)` is 1, and to `max(dp[n - 2][n - 3], dp[n - 1][n - 4] + 1, dp[n - 2][n - 2])` otherwise. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is `n - 3`.**
