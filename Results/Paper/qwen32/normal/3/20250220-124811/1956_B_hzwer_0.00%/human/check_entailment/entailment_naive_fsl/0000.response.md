Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get if both players play optimally. The main issue is that the program uses dynamic programming in a way that does not account for the optimal strategies of both players, particularly how Nene minimizes your score while maximizing her own.

Here are some specific issues:
1. The program does not keep track of the cards that are on the table during the game.
2. The program does not simulate the turns of both players.
3. The program does not account for the fact that Nene plays optimally to minimize your score.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the problem:
Input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
3
1 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
0
1
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- For the first test case, both players have one of each card (1, 2, 3). Since no card appears more than once in either player's hand, no points can be scored.
- For the second test case, you have two 1s and one 2, and Nene has one 1 and two 2s. You can score 1 point by playing a 1 when Nene has already played a 1.

However, the provided code does not correctly simulate these scenarios and will likely produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

If you need a correct implementation, a more appropriate approach would involve simulating the game and using a strategy to maximize your points while considering Nene's optimal moves.
