To determine the necessary adjustments for the provided state to ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `j` and the range it iterates over.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will iterate from `n-1` down to `0` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least `1` because `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` will generate at least one value if `n - 1` is `0` or greater.

Given that the state before the loop starts is `n` is at least `3`, this condition is already satisfied, and the loop will execute. However, we need to ensure that `j` is set to the initial value of the range, which is `n-1`.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to ensure `j` is initialized to `n-1`.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is `0`, `j` is `n-1`**
