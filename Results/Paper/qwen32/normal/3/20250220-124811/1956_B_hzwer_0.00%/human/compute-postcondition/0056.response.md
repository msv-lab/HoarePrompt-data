The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 3` and `j` is `n - 1`. The value of `dp[i][j]` is now equal to the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`, which is `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the new state is:

Output State: **`dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. For each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, if `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[2][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][j]` is `max(dp[2][j], dp[3][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][j]` is the maximum of `dp[2][j]`, `dp[3][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[2][j + 1]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is `n - 1`. Additionally, `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, meaning `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[2][j]`. `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**
