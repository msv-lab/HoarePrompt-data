The code snippet provided reads the integer `n` from the standard input, which represents the number of cards each player receives in a test case. The initial state mentions that the function `func_1` takes no arguments and that the input format includes multiple test cases. The variable `n` is the first piece of data read for each test case.

After executing the line `n = int(input())`, the variable `n` is assigned the integer value read from the input. The other parts of the precondition, such as the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent lines of input for each test case, remain unchanged and are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value read from the input, representing the number of cards each player receives in the current test case. The number of test cases `t` and the subsequent lines of input for each test case remain unchanged.**
