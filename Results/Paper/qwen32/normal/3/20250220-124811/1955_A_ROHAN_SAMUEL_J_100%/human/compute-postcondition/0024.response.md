The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and doesn't represent any state that needs to be adjusted. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`, which is `n` in this context. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the state of `n`.

Given that the loop runs `n` times, at the start of each iteration, `n` should be decremented by 1 because one iteration has just completed. The other variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop iterations.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. The relationship between `2 * a` and `b` remains unchanged regardless of whether `n` is odd or even.

Since one iteration has just finished, `n` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4; `n` is decremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. The relationship between `2 * a` and `b` remains unchanged regardless of whether `n` is odd or even.**
