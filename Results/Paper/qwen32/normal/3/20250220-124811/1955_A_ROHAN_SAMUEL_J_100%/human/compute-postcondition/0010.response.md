To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a * n)`, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `n` is an even integer.
- The current value of `a` and `b` satisfies the condition 2 * a < b.

### Analysis:
- The print statement is `print(a * n)`.
- We need to determine the value of `a * n` based on the given conditions.

### Key Points:
- `n` is an even integer, but its exact value is not specified.
- `a` is an integer, and we know that 2 * a < b, but the exact value of `a` is not specified.
- The product `a * n` will be the output.

### Output Description:
Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables. The print statement will output the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a is an integer such that 2 * a < b, and n is an even integer)**
