To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The conditions on `n`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the expression `n // 2 * b` directly since the conditions are about the relationship between `2 * a` and `b` based on whether `n` is odd or even. These conditions do not influence the calculation of `n // 2 * b`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```
Here, `n // 2` is an integer division of `n` by 2, which means it will yield the floor value of `n / 2` (i.e., the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`). Then, this result is multiplied by `b`.

### Output Calculation:
- If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer `k` such that `n = 2 * k`.
- If `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be an integer `k` such that `n = 2 * k + 1`.

In both cases, `n // 2` is simply the integer part of `n / 2`.

Therefore, the expression `n // 2 * b` will be evaluated as:
- The integer part of `n / 2` multiplied by `b`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of `n // 2 * b`, which is the integer division of `n` by 2, then multiplied by `b`.

Output: **n // 2 * b (where n // 2 is the integer division of n by 2 and b is the given integer)**
