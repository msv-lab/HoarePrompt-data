Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The promotion price for two yogurts is `b` burles.
- The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each test case and calculates the minimum cost based on the following logic:
- If `n` is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying them individually (`2 * a`). If it is, it buys as many pairs as possible and pays for the remaining single yogurt at the regular price. Otherwise, it buys all yogurts at the regular price.
- If `n` is even, it performs a similar check and then buys all yogurts in pairs if the promotion price is cheaper, or individually otherwise.

### Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Verification:
1. **Odd `n`**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `a * n`.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. **Even `n`**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `a * n`.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b`.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- `n = 1`: The program correctly calculates `a * n` since `n` is odd.
- `n = 2`: The program correctly calculates `n // 2 * b` if `2 * a >= b`, or `a * n` if `2 * a < b`.
- `n = 3`: The program correctly calculates `n // 2 * b + a` if `2 * a >= b`, or `a * n` if `2 * a < b`.
- `n = 100`: The program correctly calculates `n // 2 * b` if `2 * a >= b`, or `a * n` if `2 * a < b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs as per the problem description. It calculates the minimum cost accurately for all values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if buying yogurts in pairs (using the promotion) is cheaper than buying them individually and calculates the minimum cost accordingly for both odd and even values of `n`.
