### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts given:
- `a`: the price of one yogurt.
- `b`: the price of two yogurts under promotion.

The objective is to find the minimum cost for each test case, considering both buying individual yogurts and buying pairs under promotion.

#### Program Analysis
The provided program iterates over the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`, and then determines the minimum cost based on the following logic:
1. If `n` is odd:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper, so the cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the cost is `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible and paying `a` for the last yogurt).
2. If `n` is even:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper, so the cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the cost is `n // 2 * b` (buying pairs of yogurts).

#### Verification Against Example
Let's verify the program logic against the provided example:

1. **Input:** `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the program calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
   - **Output:** `9` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the program calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Output:** `14` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the program calculates the cost as `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
   - **Output:** `15` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the program calculates the cost as `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
   - **Output:** `20` (Correct)

The original assessment correctly verifies the program logic against the example inputs and concludes that the program is correct.

#### Annotated Code Analysis
The annotations describe the program's state at key points:
- The program reads `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It checks if `n` is odd or even and calculates the minimum cost based on the conditions provided.

The annotations align with the program's logic and confirm that the program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. It handles both even and odd values of `n` and compares the cost of buying individual yogurts versus buying pairs under promotion.

**Correctness:** **True**

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
