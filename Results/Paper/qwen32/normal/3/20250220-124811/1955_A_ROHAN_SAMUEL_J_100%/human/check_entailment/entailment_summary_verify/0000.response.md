Let's carefully analyze the provided program and function summary to determine if the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

### Program Analysis:

The program processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it determines the minimum cost based on the following logic:
- If `n` is odd:
  - If `2 * a < b`, it buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price, resulting in a cost of `a * n`.
  - If `2 * a >= b`, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`b` burles per pair) and pays the regular price (`a` burles) for the remaining single yogurt, resulting in a cost of `n // 2 * b + a`.
- If `n` is even:
  - If `2 * a < b`, it buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price, resulting in a cost of `a * n`.
  - If `2 * a >= b`, it buys all `n` yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, resulting in a cost of `n // 2 * b`.

### Verification:

Let's verify the logic with the given examples and edge cases:

1. **Example Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `2 * a = 10` and `10 > 9`, it should buy 1 pair at `b = 9` burles.
     - Output: `9`
   - **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `2 * a = 10` and `10 > 9`, it should buy 1 pair at `b = 9` burles and 1 yogurt at `a = 5` burles.
     - Output: `14`
   - **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `2 * a = 10` and `10 < 11`, it should buy all 3 yogurts individually.
     - Output: `15`
   - **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `2 * a = 10` and `10 < 11`, it should buy all 4 yogurts individually.
     - Output: `20`

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **`n = 1`:**
     - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a` will always be greater than `a`, it should buy 1 yogurt at `a` burles.
     - Output: `a`
   - **`n = 2`:**
     - If `2 * a < b`, it should buy 2 yogurts at `a` burles each.
     - If `2 * a >= b`, it should buy 1 pair at `b` burles.
   - **`n = 100`:**
     - If `2 * a < b`, it should buy all 100 yogurts at `a` burles each.
     - If `2 * a >= b`, it should buy 50 pairs at `b` burles each.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all scenarios as per the logic described. It accurately determines whether buying yogurts in pairs (using the promotion) is cheaper than buying them individually and calculates the minimum cost accordingly for both odd and even values of `n`.

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if buying yogurts in pairs (using the promotion) is cheaper than buying them individually and calculates the minimum cost accordingly for both odd and even values of `n`. It handles all edge cases and test cases correctly.
