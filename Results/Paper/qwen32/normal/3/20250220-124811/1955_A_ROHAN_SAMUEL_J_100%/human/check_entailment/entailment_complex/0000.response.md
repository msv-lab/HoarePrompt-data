### Reasoning:

The program provided calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices `a` and `b`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price of one yogurt `a`, and the price of two yogurts `b`.

2. **Logic to Determine Minimum Cost:**
   - **Case 1: `n` is odd**
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion. Therefore, the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the cost is calculated as `(n // 2) * b + a`. Here, `n // 2` pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotion price `b`, and the remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price `a`.
   - **Case 2: `n` is even**
     - If `2 * a < b`, it again means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion. Therefore, the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the cost is `(n // 2) * b`. Here, all yogurts are bought in pairs at the promotion price `b`.

3. **Verification with Example:**
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`: Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the cost is `2 // 2 * 9 = 9`.
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`: Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the cost is `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`: Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`: Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.

The logic correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and makes the right decision based on whether buying two yogurts individually or in pairs is cheaper.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
