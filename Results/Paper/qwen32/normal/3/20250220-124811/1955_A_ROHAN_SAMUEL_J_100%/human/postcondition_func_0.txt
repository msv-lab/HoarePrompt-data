The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on whether `n` is odd or even and the relative values of `2 * a` and `b`. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it outputs `a * n`. Otherwise, it outputs `n // 2 * b + a` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2 * b` if `n` is even.
