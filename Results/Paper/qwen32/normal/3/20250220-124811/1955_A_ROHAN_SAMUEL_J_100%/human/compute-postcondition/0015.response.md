The loop head in the given for loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. Here, the only variable that is being manipulated is the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and not used within the loop body), and the range is determined by the input value.

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state of the program in any meaningful way (it is not used within the loop body), we only need to consider the state of the input value that determines the range of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has already executed once. This means that the input value (which determines the number of iterations) has been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the input value must still be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` represents the number of iterations (which is the input value), after one iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1. Thus, the new state should reflect that `t` is now `t - 1` and must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `n` is odd, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
