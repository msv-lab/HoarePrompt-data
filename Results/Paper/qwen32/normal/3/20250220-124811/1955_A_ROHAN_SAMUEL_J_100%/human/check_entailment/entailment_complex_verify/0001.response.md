### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program's logic and the annotated code to ensure that it correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The objective is to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.
   - The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The price of two yogurts under promotion is `b` burles.
   - The decision-making process involves:
     - If `n` is odd:
       - If `2 * a < b`, buy individual yogurts (`a * n`).
       - Otherwise, buy as many pairs as possible (`n // 2 * b`) and pay `a` for the last yogurt (`n // 2 * b + a`).
     - If `n` is even:
       - If `2 * a < b`, buy individual yogurts (`a * n`).
       - Otherwise, buy pairs of yogurts (`n // 2 * b`).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the logic for both even and odd values of `n`.
   - For odd `n`:
     - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - For even `n`:
     - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b`.

3. **Verification Against Example**:
   - The original assessment correctly verified the program logic against the provided example inputs.
   - The calculations were accurate for each test case:
     - **Test Case 1**: `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`
       - Result: `n // 2 * b = 9` (Correct)
     - **Test Case 2**: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`
       - Result: `n // 2 * b + a = 14` (Correct)
     - **Test Case 3**: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`
       - Result: `a * n = 15` (Correct)
     - **Test Case 4**: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`
       - Result: `a * n = 20` (Correct)

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the program's state and the logic applied at each step.
   - The annotations confirm that the program processes each test case correctly based on the conditions specified.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. It handles both even and odd values of `n` and compares the cost of buying individual yogurts versus buying pairs under promotion accurately.

**Final:** **True**
