### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine if Bob can cut a given rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle from those two smaller rectangles. The key observation here is that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle. This is because he can cut the rectangle along the even dimension, resulting in two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, then cutting the rectangle along either dimension will result in two rectangles of size \(1 \times \text{odd}\), which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle different from the original.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, and if so, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No". This matches the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
