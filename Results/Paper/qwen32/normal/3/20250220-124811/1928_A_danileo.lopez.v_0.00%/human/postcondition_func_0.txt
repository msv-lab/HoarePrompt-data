The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. For each test case, it checks if at least one of the dimensions is even and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value; it only outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case.
