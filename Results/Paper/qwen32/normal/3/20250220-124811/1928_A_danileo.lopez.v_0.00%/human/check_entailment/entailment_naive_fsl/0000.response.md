Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle from a given rectangle of size \(a \times b\) by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. The logic in the program checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even. If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle from these two pieces.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all cases:
1. If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \(a/2 \times b\). These two smaller rectangles can then be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(a/2 \times 2b\).
2. If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \(a \times b/2\). These two smaller rectangles can then be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(2a \times b/2\).
3. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then neither of the resulting smaller rectangles from any cut can be combined to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

The program handles all possible cases, including edge cases where \(a\) or \(b\) is 1 (since 1 is odd, the program correctly outputs "No" in such cases).

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
