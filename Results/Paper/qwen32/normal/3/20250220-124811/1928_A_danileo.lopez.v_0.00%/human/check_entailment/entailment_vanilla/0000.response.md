### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a different rectangle. The key observation is that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, it can be cut into two smaller rectangles of integer dimensions, which can then be rearranged to form a different rectangle. 

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If \(a\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of size \(a/2 \times b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of size \(a \times b/2\).
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer dimensions that can be rearranged into a different rectangle.

2. **Reassembling the Smaller Rectangles:**
   - If the rectangle is cut into two smaller rectangles of size \(a/2 \times b\) or \(a \times b/2\), these smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle, such as \(a/2 \times 2b\) or \(2a \times b/2\).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the answer is "Yes".
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the answer is "No".

The given program correctly implements this logic by checking if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If so, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

### Correctness:

The program accurately reflects the logic described above and correctly determines if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle.

**Correctness: True**
