The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the initial state's values for `a` and `b` are overwritten with the new input values. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` and `b` are the integers provided in the input. At least one of `a` or `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are odd integers.**
