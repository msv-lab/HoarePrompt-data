The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variables `a` and `b` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop will execute. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are two integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle**
