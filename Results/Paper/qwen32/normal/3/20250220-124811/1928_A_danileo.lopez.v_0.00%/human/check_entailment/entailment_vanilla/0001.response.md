Reasoning:

To determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original by cutting it and rearranging the pieces, we need to consider the possible ways of cutting the rectangle and the resulting dimensions of the new rectangle.

1. Bob can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically.
2. If the rectangle is cut horizontally, he gets two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a x (b/2)` and `a x (b/2)` (if `b` is even) or `a x (b//2)` and `a x (b-(b//2))` (if `b` is odd).
3. Similarly, if the rectangle is cut vertically, he gets two smaller rectangles of dimensions `(a/2) x b` and `(a/2) x b` (if `a` is even) or `(a//2) x b` and `(a-(a//2)) x b` (if `a` is odd).
4. To form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles, the combined area of the smaller rectangles must match the area of the new rectangle, and the dimensions of the new rectangle must be integers.
5. The critical insight here is that if either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle. This is because he can always cut the rectangle into two equal parts along the even dimension, and rearrange these parts to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. For example, a `2x6` rectangle can be cut into two `2x3` rectangles and rearranged into a `3x4` rectangle.
6. If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting the rectangle along either dimension will result in two rectangles with one odd and one even dimension, and these cannot be rearranged to form a rectangle with integer sides that is different from the original.

Given this understanding, the provided program correctly checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes", indicating that Bob can form a new rectangle. If both are odd, it prints "No", indicating that Bob cannot form a new rectangle.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
