Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he attempts to form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. The goal is to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles that differ only by a 90Â° rotation are considered the same.

### Key Observations:
1. **Even Dimension Case**: 
   - If either dimension \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles, which can be rearranged into a \(a/2 \times 2b\) rectangle.
   - Similarly, if \(b\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times b/2\) rectangles, which can be rearranged into a \(2a \times b/2\) rectangle.

2. **Odd Dimension Case**:
   - If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, any cut will result in two smaller rectangles with at least one odd dimension. These smaller rectangles cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
   - For example, a \(3 \times 3\) rectangle can only be cut into \(3 \times 1\) and \(3 \times 2\) (which is invalid since it doesn't split into two equal parts), or \(1 \times 3\) and \(2 \times 3\) (again invalid). The resulting \(1 \times 3\) and \(1 \times 3\) rectangles cannot form a new rectangle of different dimensions.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even. If so, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Function Summary:
The function summary correctly describes the logic of the program: it checks if at least one of the dimensions is even and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No".

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle from a given rectangle of size \(a \times b\) by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. It provides a logical explanation for why the program works for all cases.

### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even, which is the correct condition for Bob to be able to form a new rectangle. If either dimension is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, he cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
