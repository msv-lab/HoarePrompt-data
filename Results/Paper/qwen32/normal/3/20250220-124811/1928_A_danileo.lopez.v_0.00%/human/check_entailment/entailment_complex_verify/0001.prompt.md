You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input. For each test case, the program has read two integers `a` and `b`, and printed 'Yes' if at least one of `a` or `b` is even, or 'No' if both `a` and `b` are odd. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not retained after the loop completes; only the outputs ('Yes' or 'No') for each test case are produced.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. For each test case, it checks if at least one of the dimensions is even and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value; it only outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original by cutting it and rearranging the pieces, we need to consider the possible ways of cutting the rectangle and the resulting dimensions of the new rectangle.

1. Bob can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically.
2. If the rectangle is cut horizontally, he gets two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a x (b/2)` and `a x (b/2)` (if `b` is even) or `a x (b//2)` and `a x (b-(b//2))` (if `b` is odd).
3. Similarly, if the rectangle is cut vertically, he gets two smaller rectangles of dimensions `(a/2) x b` and `(a/2) x b` (if `a` is even) or `(a//2) x b` and `(a-(a//2)) x b` (if `a` is odd).
4. To form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles, the combined area of the smaller rectangles must match the area of the new rectangle, and the dimensions of the new rectangle must be integers.
5. The critical insight here is that if either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle. This is because he can always cut the rectangle into two equal parts along the even dimension, and rearrange these parts to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. For example, a `2x6` rectangle can be cut into two `2x3` rectangles and rearranged into a `3x4` rectangle.
6. If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting the rectangle along either dimension will result in two rectangles with one odd and one even dimension, and these cannot be rearranged to form a rectangle with integer sides that is different from the original.

Given this understanding, the provided program correctly checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes", indicating that Bob can form a new rectangle. If both are odd, it prints "No", indicating that Bob cannot form a new rectangle.

Therefore, the program is correct.
