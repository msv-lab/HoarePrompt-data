### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to ensure the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob can cut a rectangle of size `a x b` into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle. The key points are:
1. The cut must be parallel to one of the sides.
2. The resulting rectangles can be rotated and moved.
3. Two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90Â° rotation.

From the problem, we understand that:
- If either dimension (`a` or `b`) is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle by cutting the rectangle along the even dimension and rearranging the pieces.
- If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because any cut will result in two rectangles with one odd and one even dimension, which cannot be rearranged to form a rectangle with integer sides that is different from the original.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks if either `a` or `b` is even:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```
The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the program:
- It reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it checks if at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) is even.
- If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

#### Validation Against Problem Description:
The logic in the program aligns with the critical insight from the problem description:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle by cutting along the even dimension and rearranging the pieces.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because any cut will result in two rectangles with one odd and one even dimension, which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the logic in the program and its alignment with the problem requirements. The program accurately determines whether Bob can form a new rectangle based on the dimensions of the original rectangle.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
