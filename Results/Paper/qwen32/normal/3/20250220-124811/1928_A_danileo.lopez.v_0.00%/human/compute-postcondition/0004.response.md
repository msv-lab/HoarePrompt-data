The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides some context about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Let's break it down:
- The variable `t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The variables `a` and `b` are integers provided in the input, with at least one of them being even.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement `print('Yes')`. Thus, the output will simply be the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
