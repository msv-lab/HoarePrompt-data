The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `a`, `b`, and `m`. Here, `a` and `b` represent the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installation respectively, and `m` represents the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky. There are `t` such test cases (where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`). The function processes each test case and returns a value based on the inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, representing the frequency of launching fireworks and their visibility duration, respectively. It processes each test case and returns a value based on these inputs.**
