To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet, it's provided as part of the precondition).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(A + B)
```

### Explanation:
- **`A` Calculation**: `A` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, plus 1. This means `A` is the number of times `a` fits into `m` (rounded down) plus one.
- **`B` Calculation**: `B` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, plus 1. This means `B` is the number of times `b` fits into `m` (rounded down) plus one.

### Output Calculation:
The `print(A + B)` statement will output the sum of `A` and `B`.

### Final Output:
The output will be the sum of `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1`.

Output: **int(m / a) + int(m / b) + 2 (where A is int(m / a) + 1 and B is int(m / b) + 1)**

This format provides the most precise description possible based on the given information.
