You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        print(A + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18) where a and b represent the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installation respectively, and m represents the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.

    #State: `t` is 0; the loop has finished executing for all test cases; no further input values are read; the final outputs for all test cases have been printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program and the problem statement step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. Fireworks are launched by two installations at intervals `a` and `b` minutes, respectively. Each firework remains visible for `m + 1` minutes after it is launched.

### Key Points:
1. **Firework Visibility**: A firework launched at time `x` will be visible from time `x` to `x + m`.
2. **Multiple Launches**: Both installations launch fireworks at regular intervals.
3. **Simultaneous Visibility**: We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

### Approach:
To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously:
- **Launch Times**: Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times `0, a, 2a, 3a, ...`.
- **Launch Times**: Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times `0, b, 2b, 3b, ...`.
- **Visibility**: Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

The key insight is that we need to consider the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks from both installations.

### Calculation:
- The number of fireworks from the first installation that can be visible at any given time is `floor(m / a) + 1`.
- The number of fireworks from the second installation that can be visible at any given time is `floor(m / b) + 1`.

However, the program provided simply adds these two values together, which does not account for the overlap of visibility periods between fireworks from the two installations.

### Overlap Consideration:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculating the number of fireworks visible at the LCM time.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not account for the overlap of visibility periods and thus does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not consider the overlap of visibility periods between fireworks from the two installations.
