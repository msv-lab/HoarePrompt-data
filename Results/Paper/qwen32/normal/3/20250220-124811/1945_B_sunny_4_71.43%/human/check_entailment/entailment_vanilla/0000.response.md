Let's analyze the given Python program and the problem statement step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. Fireworks are launched by two installations at intervals `a` and `b` minutes, respectively. Each firework remains visible for `m + 1` minutes after it is launched.

### Key Points:
1. **Firework Visibility**: A firework launched at time `x` will be visible from time `x` to `x + m`.
2. **Multiple Launches**: Both installations launch fireworks at regular intervals.
3. **Simultaneous Visibility**: We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

### Approach:
To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously:
- **Launch Times**: Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times `0, a, 2a, 3a, ...`.
- **Launch Times**: Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times `0, b, 2b, 3b, ...`.
- **Visibility**: Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

The key insight is that we need to consider the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks from both installations.

### Calculation:
- The number of fireworks from the first installation that can be visible at any given time is `floor(m / a) + 1`.
- The number of fireworks from the second installation that can be visible at any given time is `floor(m / b) + 1`.

However, the program provided simply adds these two values together, which does not account for the overlap of visibility periods between fireworks from the two installations.

### Overlap Consideration:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculating the number of fireworks visible at the LCM time.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not account for the overlap of visibility periods and thus does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not consider the overlap of visibility periods between fireworks from the two installations.
