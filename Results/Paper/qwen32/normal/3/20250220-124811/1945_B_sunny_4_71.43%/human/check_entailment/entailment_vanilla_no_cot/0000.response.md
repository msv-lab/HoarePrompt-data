Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is simply the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility time `m`. However, it does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and how fireworks from both installations overlap within the visibility period. The correct approach involves calculating the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and then adjusting for overlaps.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        # Number of fireworks launched by each installation
        A = (m // a) + 1
        B = (m // b) + 1
        
        # Number of overlapping fireworks
        overlap = (m // lcm_ab) + 1
        
        # Maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
        result = A + B - overlap
        print(result)

func()
```

This program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap of fireworks from both installations and adjusts the total count accordingly.
