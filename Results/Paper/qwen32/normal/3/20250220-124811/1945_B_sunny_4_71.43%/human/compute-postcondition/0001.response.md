The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts since it is a throwaway variable used in the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers representing the frequency of launching fireworks and the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky**
