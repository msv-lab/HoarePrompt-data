Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` that do not remain the same when reversed, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is equal to the length of `rev_val`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_res` is a concatenated string of elements in `operational_list` that remain the same when reversed plus the processed elements from `rev_val` (converted back to their original form or reversed as appropriate), `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list`. If 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power` is less than the integer value of `rev_res`, then the condition holds true; otherwise, it does not.**
