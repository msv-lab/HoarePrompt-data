The given code snippet appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. Here's the specific impact on the variables:

- `rev_val` is updated to include the reversed string of `x`. If `rev_val` was initially an empty list or contained the string `'0'`, it will now contain that initial value followed by the reversed string of `x`.

The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the string `'0'` and the reversed string of `x`, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is `next_x` (the next element in `operational_list`), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `next_x`, `y` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer value of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `next_x`, then `rev_res` is `'0' + next_x` if `rev_res` was `'0'` or `next_x` if `rev_res` was an empty string. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the string `'0'` and `rev_res` is an empty string.**

In simpler terms: `rev_val` now contains the reversed string of `x` appended to its previous contents. All other variables remain as they were initially described.
