Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where reversing changed the length, `rev_res` is a concatenation of strings from `operational_list` where reversing did not change the length, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 1, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where reversing changed the length and must have at least one element, `rev_res` is a concatenation of strings from `operational_list` where reversing did not change the length, plus the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or plus the reverse of `val_in` if `x` is odd, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 1, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, and `val_in` is the integer representation of the `x`-th element of `rev_val` if `x` is even, or the value at index `x` of `rev_val` if `x` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where reversing changed the length and must have at least one element, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `val_in` is the integer representation of the `x`-th element of `rev_val` if `x` is even, or the value at index `x` of `rev_val` if `x` is odd, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 1, `rev_res` is a concatenation of strings from `operational_list` where reversing did not change the length, plus the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or plus the reverse of `val_in` if `x` is odd, plus the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or plus the reverse of `val_in` again if `x` is odd, `x` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is incremented by 1. If `x` is even, `val_in` is assigned the integer value of `rev_val[x]` and `rev_res` is updated to include the string representation of `val_in`. Otherwise, `val_in` is assigned the value of `rev_val[x]` and `rev_res` is updated to include the reverse of `val_in` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
