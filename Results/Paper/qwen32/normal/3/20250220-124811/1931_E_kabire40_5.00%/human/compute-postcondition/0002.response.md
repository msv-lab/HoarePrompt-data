The given code snippet initializes a variable `rev_res` to an empty string. This affects only the `rev_res` variable, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `rev_val` is an empty list; `rev_res` is an empty string.**
