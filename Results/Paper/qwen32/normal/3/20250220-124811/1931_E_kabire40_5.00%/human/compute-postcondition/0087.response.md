Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `rev_val`, `list_len`, `max_power` retain their initial values. `x` is the index of the next element in `rev_val` (i.e., `x + 1`). If `x` is even, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]` and `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value with the string representation of `val_in`. Otherwise, `val_in` is the element at index `x` in `rev_val` and `rev_res` includes the original string of `val_in` appended to it.**
