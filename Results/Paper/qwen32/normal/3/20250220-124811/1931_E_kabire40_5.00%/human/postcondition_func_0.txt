The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines whether to print "Sasha" or "Anna" based on the reversed values of the integers in `a` and the value of `m`. Specifically, it reverses each integer in `a`, sorts the reversed integers of certain lengths, and constructs a result string. If the integer value of this result string exceeds `10` raised to the power of `m`, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Anna".
