The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which is an element from `operational_list`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `x` to the next element in `operational_list`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in `operational_list`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the y-th element of `operational_list`.
- `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 2, which implies that `y` is out of bounds for the current list, meaning the previous iteration was the last one.

However, to find the state for the next iteration, let's assume we are in a scenario where `y` is within the bounds of `operational_list` and we need to move to the next element.

Let's denote the length of `operational_list` as `len_list`. If `y` was the index of the last element processed, then the next `x` should be the next element in the list, i.e., `operational_list[y + 1]`.

Since `y` is the length of `operational_list` + 2, and we need to consider the next valid element, we should adjust `y` to be within the bounds of `operational_list`. The next valid `y` should be the current `y - 2` (since `y` was out of bounds by 2).

So, the next `x` should be `operational_list[y - 2 + 1]` which simplifies to `operational_list[y - 1]`.

However, since `y` is out of bounds, let's consider the next valid iteration where `y` is within bounds. If `y` was the last valid index, then the next iteration would not execute. But for the sake of the task, let's assume `y` is adjusted to the next valid index.

Let's assume `y` is adjusted to be the index of the next element to be processed. Therefore, `y` should be `y - 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is the (y-1)-th element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` read in reverse order, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 1, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line and must contain at least `y-1` strings. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is either `x` or `'0' + x` and `rev_val` is either an empty list or contains ["0"]. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` contains either `["0", x_reversed]` or `[x_reversed]` where `x_reversed` is the string `x` reversed.**

Note: Since `y` was initially out of bounds, the loop would not execute another iteration with the given `y`. The state provided is a hypothetical next iteration where `y` is adjusted to be within bounds.
