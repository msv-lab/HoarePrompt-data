Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for all j from 0 to n-1, `eta` is a list containing all values of `j` for which `q[j] > 0`, and `j` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `eta` will contain all unique values from the list `w` (since `q[j]` is incremented for each occurrence of `j` in `w`). The variables `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, and `w` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `j` will have the value `n` after the loop finishes.
