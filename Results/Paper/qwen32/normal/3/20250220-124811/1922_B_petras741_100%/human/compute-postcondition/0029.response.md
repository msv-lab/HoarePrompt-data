To determine the output of the provided print statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

1. **Variable Initialization and Input**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `buffer` is an empty list.
   - `n` is a new input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `w` is a list of integers derived from the input.
   - `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except for each `q[w[j]]` which is incremented by 1 for all \(j\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `eta` is a list containing all values of `j` for which `q[j] > 0`.
   - `j` is initialized to `n`.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is given to be 1.
   - `rho` is the count of the smallest integer in `w` that appears at least once.

2. **The Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)`.

3. **Calculating the Output**:
   - The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from `n` items without regard to the order of selection. This is the combination formula \(C(n, 3) = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}\).
   - Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, the output will be in terms of `n`.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output the value of the combination formula \(C(n, 3)\).

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5)**
