The code snippet calculates the length of the list `eta` and assigns it to the variable `eta_ln`. The values of `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of `eta_ln`, which holds the length of `eta`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.**
