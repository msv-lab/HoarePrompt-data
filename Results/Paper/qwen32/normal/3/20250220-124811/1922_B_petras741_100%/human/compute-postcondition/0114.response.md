The code snippet appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, but the increment operation is not part of the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `eta` now contains the value of `j`. 

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `j` is incremented by 1, `eta` contains the value of `j`.**
