The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, and `n` is a new input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\). If `q[j] > 0`, then `eta` contains the value of `j`. However, we are only concerned with the loop head variables `j` and `n` for the next iteration.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `j` is `j + 1`**
