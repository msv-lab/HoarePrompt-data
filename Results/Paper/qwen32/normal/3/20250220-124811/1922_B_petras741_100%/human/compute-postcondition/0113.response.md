The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has taken on a value such that the loop has not yet terminated. To proceed to the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given that `n` is a new input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), and the condition for appending `j` to `eta` is that `q[j]` is greater than 0, this condition does not affect the state of `j` itself, only what happens inside the loop body.

State: **`n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `j` is incremented by 1** 

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we adjust `j` accordingly.

State: **`n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `j` is `j + 1`** 

To be more explicit, if `j` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `j` is 4** (if `j` was 3 previously)

But since we do not know the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we express the state in terms of the increment:

State: **`n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `j` is incremented by 1** 

For the sake of clarity in the final format, we can express it as:

State: **`n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `j` is `j + 1`**

However, to match the format of previous examples:

State: **`n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `j` is incremented by 1**
