Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing all indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]`, `res` is updated to include `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` added to its previous value.**

The value of `res` has been updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values.
