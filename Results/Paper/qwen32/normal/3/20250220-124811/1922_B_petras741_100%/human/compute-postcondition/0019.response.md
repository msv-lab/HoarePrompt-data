The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop definition, `j` ranges from 0 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `j` equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for all j from 0 to n-1. If `q[j] > 0`, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j`. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list, `j` is 1**
