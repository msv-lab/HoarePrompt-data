The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1**
