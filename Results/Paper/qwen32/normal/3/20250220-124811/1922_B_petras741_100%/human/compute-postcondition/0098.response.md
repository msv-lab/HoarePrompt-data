The code provided only reads a new value for `n` from the input. This new value of `n` will replace the previous value of `n` provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, and `res` are calculated as described in the initial state. If `n` is less than 3, no additional changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`.**
