Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `eta` list will contain all the indices from 0 to `n` for which the corresponding value in `q` is greater than 0. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states as they are not modified within the loop.
