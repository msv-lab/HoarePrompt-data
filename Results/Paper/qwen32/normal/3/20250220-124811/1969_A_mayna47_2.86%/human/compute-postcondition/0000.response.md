The code snippet provided only reads an integer `n` from the input. It does not affect the values of `t` or `p`. Therefore, the value of `n` is updated based on the input, but `t` and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i.**
