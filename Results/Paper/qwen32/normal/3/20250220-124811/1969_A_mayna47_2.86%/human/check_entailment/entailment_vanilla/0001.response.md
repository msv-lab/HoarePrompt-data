Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation. The goal is to find the smallest number of invitations that ensure at least 2 friends attend.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. Reads the number of friends, `n`.
2. Reads the list of best friends, `p`, and stores it in the list `v` with an offset (so `v[i]` corresponds to `p_i`).
3. If `n == 2`, it prints `2` because both friends must be invited.
4. Otherwise, it checks if there is a triplet of friends `i, v[i], v[v[i]]` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a triplet exists, it means that inviting these three friends will ensure that at least two of them (the middle two) will come to the party, and it prints `2`.
5. If no such triplet is found, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Analysis
The program correctly handles the case when `n == 2` by directly printing `2` because both friends must be invited for either to come to the party.

However, the program's logic for `n > 2` is flawed. The program checks for a specific triplet condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` and concludes that inviting these three friends will ensure that at least two of them come to the party. This is not necessarily true for all configurations of best friends. 

For example, consider the case `n = 4` with `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, no such triplet `v[v[v[i]]] == i` exists, but inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 is sufficient because friends 1 and 2 will come to the party. The program would incorrectly print `3` in this case.

Additionally, there are configurations where only 2 invitations are needed, but the program might print `3` because it doesn't find the specific triplet condition.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all cases and might give incorrect results for certain configurations of best friends. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
