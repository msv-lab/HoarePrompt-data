Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= n, `p_i` != i; `v` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next n elements are integers read from the input. It is not the case that `v[v[v[i]]] == i` for the current `i`.**
