Output State: **The program returns nothing (None)**

Explanation: The provided code snippet ends with a `return` statement without any value specified, which means the function will return `None` by default. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `p`, `v`, or `i` are used in the return statement, so their specific values do not affect the output.
