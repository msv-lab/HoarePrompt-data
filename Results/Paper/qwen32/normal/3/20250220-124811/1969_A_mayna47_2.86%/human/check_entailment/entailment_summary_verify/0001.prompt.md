You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. It then prints either `2` or `3` based on a specific condition involving the list `p`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation. The goal is to find the smallest number of invitations that ensure at least 2 friends attend.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. Reads the number of friends, `n`.
2. Reads the list of best friends, `p`, and stores it in the list `v` with an offset (so `v[i]` corresponds to `p_i`).
3. If `n == 2`, it prints `2` because both friends must be invited.
4. Otherwise, it checks if there is a triplet of friends `i, v[i], v[v[i]]` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a triplet exists, it means that inviting these three friends will ensure that at least two of them (the middle two) will come to the party, and it prints `2`.
5. If no such triplet is found, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Analysis
The program correctly handles the case when `n == 2` by directly printing `2` because both friends must be invited for either to come to the party.

However, the program's logic for `n > 2` is flawed. The program checks for a specific triplet condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` and concludes that inviting these three friends will ensure that at least two of them come to the party. This is not necessarily true for all configurations of best friends. 

For example, consider the case `n = 4` with `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, no such triplet `v[v[v[i]]] == i` exists, but inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 is sufficient because friends 1 and 2 will come to the party. The program would incorrectly print `3` in this case.

Additionally, there are configurations where only 2 invitations are needed, but the program might print `3` because it doesn't find the specific triplet condition.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all cases and might give incorrect results for certain configurations of best friends. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
