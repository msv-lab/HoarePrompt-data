The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 1.

The other variables (`t`, `lex`, `cases`, `arr`, `i`, `k`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1] or [26], `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**
