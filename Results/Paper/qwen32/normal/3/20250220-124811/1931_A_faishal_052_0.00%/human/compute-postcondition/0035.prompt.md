Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the integer 1. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the integer 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then `lex` is now `lex - 1` (and thus less than or equal to 25), otherwise `lex` is `lex - 26`. `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`, and `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25 then `lex` is now `lex - 1` (and thus less than or equal to 24), if `lex` was initially between 26 and 51 then `lex` is now `lex - 27` (and thus less than or equal to 24), if `lex` was initially between 52 and 77 then `lex` is now `lex - 26` (and thus less than or equal to -1), if `lex` was initially between 78 and 103 then `lex` is now `lex - 52` (and thus between 26 and 51), `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, `[26, 26, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, or `[26, 26, 26]`, and `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
