The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the `for` loop, `j` iterates over the range `[0, 1]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 0, as the loop will then iterate over the next value in the range.

The other variables `t`, `lex`, `cases`, `arr`, `i`, and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input minus 1 if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, otherwise `lex` is `lex - 26`, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1, 1], [26, 1], [1, 26], or [26, 26] depending on the initial value of `lex`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 3**
