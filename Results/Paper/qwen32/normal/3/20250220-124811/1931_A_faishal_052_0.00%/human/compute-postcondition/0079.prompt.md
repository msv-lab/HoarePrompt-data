Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, lex is the integer value provided by the user input, cases is greater than 2, arr is [], `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1] or [26], `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `lex` is now `lex` minus 1 and `arr` is [1]. If `lex` was originally greater than 26, `arr` is [26] and if `lex` was less than 52, `lex` is now `lex` minus 26 and is greater than 0 but less than 26. Otherwise, `lex` is `lex` minus 26 and is greater than 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input minus 1 if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, otherwise `lex` is `lex - 26`, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1, 1], [26, 1], [1, 26], or [26, 26] depending on the initial value of `lex`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value: if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, it is decreased by 2 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise it is decreased by 27. If `lex` was greater than 26, it is decreased by 52 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise it is decreased by 52. `cases` is greater than 2. `arr` is either [1, 1, 1], [26, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], [26, 26, 1], [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26] depending on the initial value of `lex`. `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
