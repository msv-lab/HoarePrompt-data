The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must have been 0 (since the loop iterates twice, from `j = 0` to `j = 1`).

To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` should be 1.

The variables `t`, `lex`, `cases`, and `arr` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the integer 1. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the integer 26, `j` is 1**
