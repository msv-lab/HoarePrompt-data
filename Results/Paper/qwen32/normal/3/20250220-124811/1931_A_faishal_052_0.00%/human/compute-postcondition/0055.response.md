The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Given that `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, after subtracting 26, the new value of `lex` will be greater than 0 but less than 26. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is [26], `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3.**
