The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3, but since the loop condition is `k < 3`, the loop will not execute again after `k` is 3. However, we need to adjust the state as if we are moving to the next iteration before the loop terminates.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then `lex` is now `lex - 2` (and thus less than or equal to 24), otherwise `lex` is `lex - 27` if it was initially between 26 and 51, or `lex - 52` if it was initially between 52 and 77, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, or `[1, 26, 26]`, and `j` is 1, `k` is 3**
