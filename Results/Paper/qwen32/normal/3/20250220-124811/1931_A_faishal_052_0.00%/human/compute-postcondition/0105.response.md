The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit `2`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by `1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 1 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer greater than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2. Additionally, if `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, the last element of `arr` is 26**
