Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 25 then `lex` is now `lex - 1` (and thus less than or equal to 24), otherwise `lex` is `lex - 27`, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, or `[26, 26, 1]`, and `j` is 2.**

Natural Language: The value of `lex` has been decremented by 1. If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25, it is now `lex - 1` and thus less than or equal to 24. If `lex` was initially greater than 25, it is now `lex - 27` since it was previously decremented by 26 in the initial state and then by 1 in the code snippet. The values of `t`, `cases`, `arr`, and `j` remain unchanged.
