Let's analyze the program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: An integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `n` (3 <= n <= 78) representing encoded words.
2. **Output**: For each integer `n`, output the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to `n`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it tries to determine the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to the given integer `lex`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, an empty list `arr` is created to store the positions of the letters.
2. **First Two Letters**: The program loops twice to determine the positions of the first two letters:
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 1.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it appends 26 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 26.
   - If `lex` is greater than 51, it appends 26 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 26.
3. **Third Letter**: The remaining value of `lex` is directly appended to `arr`.
4. **Sorting and Output**: The list `arr` is sorted, and the corresponding letters (by converting each number to a character using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`) are printed in order.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Determining Letters**: The current logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. It does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might output "aav" instead of "aaa", but it does so by appending 1 twice and then 22, which is not the smallest possible combination.
2. **Sorting**: Sorting the list `arr` after appending the values does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word because the order of appending the values is not considered.

### Correct Approach:
To ensure the lexicographically smallest word, the program should:
- Start by assigning the smallest possible values (1) to the first two letters.
- Adjust the third letter to make the sum equal to `lex`.
- Ensure that the letters are in non-decreasing order to maintain lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the program logic, it does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
