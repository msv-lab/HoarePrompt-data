The given loop iterates exactly 3 times, as indicated by `for k in range(3)`. Each iteration of the loop prints a character based on the values in the `arr` list. Since the loop runs exactly 3 times, there is no further iteration beyond `k=3`.

Here is the output state after the loop completes all iterations:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, lex is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then lex is now lex - 2 (and thus less than or equal to 24), otherwise lex is lex - 27 if it was initially between 26 and 51, or lex - 52 if it was initially between 52 and 77, cases is greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list that is either [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 26], or [1, 26, 26], and j is 1, k is 3**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value: it is reduced by 2 if it was initially 26 or less, by 27 if it was between 26 and 51, or by 52 if it was between 52 and 77.
- The variable `cases` remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to 1.
- The variable `arr` remains unchanged and is one of the three possible lists: `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, or `[1, 26, 26]`.
- The variable `j` remains unchanged and is still 1.
- The loop variable `k` is 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
