Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `cases` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    arr = []
    lex = int(input())
    for j in range(2):
        if lex <= 26:
            arr.append(1)
            lex = lex - 1
        elif lex < 52:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
        else:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
    arr.append(lex)
    arr.sort()
    for k in range(3):
        print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, lex is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then lex is now lex - 2 (and thus less than or equal to 24), otherwise lex is lex - 27 if it was initially between 26 and 51, or lex - 52 if it was initially between 52 and 77, cases is greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list that is either [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 26], or [1, 26, 26], and j is 1, k is 3

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value but is less than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, lex, 26]`, or `[lex, 26, 26]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2. The loop will have printed the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` in sequence.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: 'az' + chr(lex + 96)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
