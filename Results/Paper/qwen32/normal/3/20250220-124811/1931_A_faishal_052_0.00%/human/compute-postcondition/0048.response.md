The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is in the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive). Therefore, `j` must be 0 for the loop to start executing.

The other variables (`t`, `lex`, `cases`, `arr`, `i`, and `k`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, lex is the integer value provided by the user input, cases is greater than 2, arr is [], `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3**
