The code snippet `lex = int(input())` assigns a new integer value to `lex` based on the user input. The initial state of `lex` is not relevant after this assignment, as it is overwritten by the input value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, lex is the integer value provided by the user input, cases is greater than 2, arr is [], `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**.
