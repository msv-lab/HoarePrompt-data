The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value but is less than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, lex, 26]`, or `[lex, 26, 26]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2**
