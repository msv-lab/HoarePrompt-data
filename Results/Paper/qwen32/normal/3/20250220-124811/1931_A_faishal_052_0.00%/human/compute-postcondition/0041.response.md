To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value:
  - If `lex` was initially \(\leq 26\), then `lex` is now `lex - 2`.
  - If `lex` was initially between 26 and 51, then `lex` is now `lex - 27`.
  - If `lex` was initially between 52 and 77, then `lex` is now `lex - 52`.
- `cases` is an integer that is \(\geq 1\).
- `arr` is a list that can be one of the following: `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, or `[1, 26, 26]`.
- `j` is 1.
- `k` is 2.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```
- `arr[k]` refers to the element at index `k` in the list `arr`. Since `k` is 2, we are looking at the third element of `arr`.
- The third element of `arr` can be 1, 26, or 26 (depending on which of the three possible lists `arr` is).
- `chr(arr[k] + 96)` converts the ASCII value to a character:
  - If `arr[k]` is 1, then `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is 'a'.
  - If `arr[k]` is 26, then `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is 'z'.

### Conclusion:
Given that `arr` can be `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, or `[1, 26, 26]`, the third element (`arr[k]` where `k` is 2) can be either 1 or 26. Therefore, the print statement will output either 'a' or 'z'.

### Output:
Output: **a or z (depending on the value of arr)**
