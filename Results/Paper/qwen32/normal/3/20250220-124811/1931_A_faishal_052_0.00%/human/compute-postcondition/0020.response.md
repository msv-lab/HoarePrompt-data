Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the integers 1 and 26. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the integers 26 and 26, `j` is 1.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The value of `lex` remains an input integer. The value of `cases` remains greater than or equal to 1. The list `arr` now contains an additional element, the integer 26. If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, `arr` now contains the integers 1 and 26. If `lex` was greater than 26, `arr` now contains the integers 26 and 26. The value of `j` remains 1.
