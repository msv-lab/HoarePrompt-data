The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `cases` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value but is less than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, lex, 26]`, or `[lex, 26, 26]`, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2. The loop will have printed the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` in sequence.**
