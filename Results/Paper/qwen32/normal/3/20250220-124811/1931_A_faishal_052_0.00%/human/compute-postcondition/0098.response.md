The code appends the integer `26` to the list `arr`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `lex`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer greater than 26 but less than 52, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 4 elements where the last element is 26, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2.**
