Let's break down the given information step by step to determine what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. However, `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
   - `lex` is adjusted based on its original value (decremented by 1 or 26 for each iteration), but we don't have the original value of `lex`.
   - `cases` is greater than 2, but `cases` is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
   - `arr` is a sorted list with 3 elements (the first two being either 1 or 26, and the third being `lex`).
   - `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 2. However, `i` and `j` are not used in the provided code snippet.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `k` is 2, so `arr[k]` refers to the third element of the list `arr`.
   - `arr` is a sorted list with 3 elements where the first two are either 1 or 26, and the third being `lex`. Since `arr` is sorted and the first two elements are either 1 or 26, the third element `lex` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 26 (assuming `lex` is within the typical range for a letter in the alphabet).
   - The expression `chr(arr[k] + 96)` converts the value of `arr[k]` (which is `lex`) to its corresponding ASCII character. The ASCII value for 'a' is 97, so adding 96 to `lex` will map `lex` to the correct letter in the alphabet. For example, if `lex` is 1, `chr(1 + 96)` will be 'a'; if `lex` is 2, `chr(2 + 96)` will be 'b', and so on up to `lex` being 26, which will map to 'z'.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The code will print the character corresponding to the value of `lex` in the alphabet.

Given the constraints and the code, the output will be the character that corresponds to the value of `lex` after adding 96 to it. Since we don't have the exact value of `lex`, we can describe the output in terms of `lex`.

Output: **[character corresponding to lex in the alphabet] (where lex is the third element of the sorted list `arr`)**
