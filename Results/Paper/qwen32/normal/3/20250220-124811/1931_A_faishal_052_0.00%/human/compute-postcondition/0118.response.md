The code snippet provided decrements the value of `lex` by 26. We need to consider the initial state of `lex` to determine the new value of `lex` after this operation.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `lex` is an input integer minus 1 if it was originally <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer in the range 0 to 25 if it was originally in the range 27 to 51, or greater than 0 if it was originally > 51
- `cases` is greater than 2
- `arr` is a list with at least 6 elements where the last element is 26 and the second-to-last element is 26 if `lex` (after decrementing by 1) is greater than 25 and less than 51
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 2
- `k` is 2

After executing `lex = lex - 26`, the value of `lex` will change based on its initial value:
- If `lex` was originally in the range 0 to 25 (which means the original `lex` was in the range 1 to 26), then `lex` will become negative.
- If `lex` was originally in the range 26 to 50 (which means the original `lex` was in the range 27 to 51), then `lex` will become 0 to 24.
- If `lex` was originally greater than 50 (which means the original `lex` was greater than 51), then `lex` will remain greater than 24.

The values of `t`, `cases`, `arr`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The condition for `arr` being a list with at least 6 elements where the last element is 26 and the second-to-last element is 26 if `lex` (after decrementing by 1) is greater than 25 and less than 51 will also be updated based on the new value of `lex`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `lex` is an integer that is either negative if it was originally in the range 0 to 25, in the range 0 to 24 if it was originally in the range 26 to 50, or greater than 24 if it was originally greater than 50; `cases` is greater than 2; `arr` is a list with at least 6 elements where the last element is 26 and the second-to-last element is 26 if the new `lex` is in the range 0 to 24, `i` is 3; `j` is 2; `k` is 2.**
