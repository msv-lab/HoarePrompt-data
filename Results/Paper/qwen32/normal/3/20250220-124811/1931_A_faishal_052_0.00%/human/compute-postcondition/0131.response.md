Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `lex` is adjusted based on its original value (decremented by 1 or 26 for each iteration).
- `cases` is greater than 2.
- `arr` is a sorted list with 3 elements (the first two being either 1 or 26, and the third being `lex`).
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Analysis:
- `arr` is a sorted list with 3 elements. The first two elements are either 1 or 26, and the third element is `lex`.
- `k` is 2, so `arr[k]` refers to the third element of `arr`, which is `lex`.
- The function `chr()` converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
- `arr[k] + 96` means we are adding 96 to the value of `lex` to get the ASCII value of the corresponding character.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `arr` is sorted and the first two elements are either 1 or 26, the third element `lex` must be between 1 and 26 (inclusive).
- Adding 96 to `lex` will give us an ASCII value corresponding to a lowercase letter (since ASCII values for 'a' to 'z' are 97 to 122).
- Therefore, `chr(arr[k] + 96)` will convert `lex` to its corresponding lowercase letter.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `lex`.

### Output:
Output: **[character corresponding to lex] (where lex is the third element of the sorted list arr, and is between 1 and 26)**

Since the exact value of `lex` is not specified, we can describe the output in terms of `lex`.

### Final Output:
Output: **character corresponding to lex (where lex is the third element of the sorted list arr, and is between 1 and 26)**
