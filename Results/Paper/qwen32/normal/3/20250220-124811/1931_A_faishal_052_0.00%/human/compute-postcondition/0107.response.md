Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 2 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer greater than 25, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements where the last element is 1, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2. Additionally, if `lex` (after decrementing by 1) is greater than 25 and less than 51, the second-to-last element of `arr` is 26.**

In simpler terms, `lex` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. If `lex` was initially between 26 and 51 (inclusive), it is now between 25 and 50 (inclusive).
