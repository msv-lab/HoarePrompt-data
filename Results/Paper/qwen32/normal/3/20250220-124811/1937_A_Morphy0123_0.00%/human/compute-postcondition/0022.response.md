The code snippet `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`, converting the input to an integer. The variables `n_cases` and `i` are not affected by this line of code. The variable `power` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` is the integer value provided by the user input; `power` remains unchanged.**
