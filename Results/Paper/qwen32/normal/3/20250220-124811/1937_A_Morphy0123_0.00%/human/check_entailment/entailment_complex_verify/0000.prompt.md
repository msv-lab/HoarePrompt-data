You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), representing the length of the array a.

    #State: `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is equal to `n_cases` after all iterations have completed; for each of the `n_cases` iterations, the program has read an integer `n` from the input, and printed `2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the position of the number 1 after performing the described swap operations for all potential cases.

Let's analyze the logic of the program and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Initial Setup**: The array is initialized such that `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.

2. **Swap Operation**: For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the operation `swap(i)` is performed. This operation swaps `a_d` and `a_i` where `d` is the largest divisor of `i` other than `i` itself.

3. **Objective**: After performing all the swap operations, we need to find the position `j` such that `a_j = 1`.

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating powers of 2. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the swap operations and does not handle all edge cases.

### Issues with the Provided Code:
- The code calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` and prints `2 ** power` as the result. This logic does not correctly simulate the swap operations and does not yield the correct position of 1 in all cases.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the test case `n = 5`:
- Initially, the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- After `swap(2)`, the array becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`.
- After `swap(3)`, the array becomes `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`.
- After `swap(4)`, the array becomes `[3, 4, 2, 1, 5]`.
- After `swap(5)`, the array remains `[3, 4, 2, 1, 5]` because 5 has no divisors other than 1 and 5.

The final position of 1 is at index 4, not `2 ** power` for any power.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the swap operations for each `i` from 2 to `n` and track the position of the number 1.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            position_of_1 = 1
            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                largest_divisor = 1
                for j in range(2, i):
                    if i % j == 0:
                        largest_divisor = j
                if largest_divisor == position_of_1:
                    position_of_1 = i
                elif largest_divisor == i:
                    position_of_1 = 1
            print(position_of_1)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected code correctly simulates the swap operations and finds the correct position of 1 for all test cases.
