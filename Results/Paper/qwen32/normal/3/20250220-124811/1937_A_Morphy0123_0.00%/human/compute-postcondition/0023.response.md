The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes several variables (`n_cases`, `i`, `n`, `power`), but the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. Therefore, the output is simply the integer `1`.

Here's the detailed explanation:
- The variable `n_cases` represents the number of test cases.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0.
- The variable `n` is an integer value provided by user input.
- The variable `power` remains unchanged.

None of these variables affect the `print(1)` statement. The statement directly prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
