The loop head in the provided `while` loop is `power < log2(n)`. Therefore, we need to adjust the states of `power` and `n` to ensure that the condition `power < log2(n)` holds true for the next iteration.

From the provided state:
- `power` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`. Since `power` is currently 2, we need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 2. This means `n` must be greater than 4 (since `log2(4) = 2`).

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` must be greater than 4; `power` is 2**.
