To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition: `power` and `n`.

The loop condition is `while power < log2(n):`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than the base-2 logarithm of `n`.

Given:
- `power` is currently 3.
- `n` must be greater than 4.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `power` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than 4, so the smallest possible value for `n` is 5.

Calculate `log2(n)` for `n = 5`:
- `log2(5) ≈ 2.32`

Since `power` (which is 3) is not less than `log2(5)` (which is approximately 2.32), the loop will not execute if `n` is 5.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `n` such that `log2(n)` is greater than `power`, which is 3.

Let's find the smallest `n` for which `log2(n) > 3`:
- `log2(n) > 3` implies `n > 2^3`
- `n > 8`

Therefore, the smallest integer `n` that satisfies this condition is 9.

So, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 8.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` must be greater than 8; `power` is 3.**
