Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is not yet initialized.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^(`power` + 1) is greater than or equal to `n`.
- `power` has been decremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine `power`**:
   - `power` is defined as the smallest integer such that 2^(`power` + 1) ≥ `n`.
   - This implies that 2^`power` < `n` but 2^(`power` + 1) ≥ `n`.
   - After the definition, `power` is decremented by 1. Therefore, `power` now satisfies 2^`power` < `n` and 2^(`power` + 1) < `n` is not guaranteed; instead, 2^(`power` + 1) < 2^n but 2^(`power` + 2) ≥ `n`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(2 ** power)` will output the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^(`power` + 1) ≥ `n` and has been decremented by 1, 2^`power` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `n`.

### Output:
Output: **2^power (where 2^power is the largest power of 2 that is less than n)**
