Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is equal to `n_cases` after all iterations have completed; for each of the `n_cases` iterations, the program has read an integer `n` from the input, and printed `2 ** power` where `power` is the largest integer such that 2^(`power` + 1) is greater than or equal to `n`, unless `power` was originally equal to `n`, in which case `2 ** power` is printed.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop variable `i` will have reached the value of `n_cases`, indicating that the loop has processed all the test cases. For each test case, the program reads an integer `n` and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.
