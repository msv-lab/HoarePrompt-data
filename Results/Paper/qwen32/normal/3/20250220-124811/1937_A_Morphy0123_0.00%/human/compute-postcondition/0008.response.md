The value of `power` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `power` is 1, after the operation, `power` becomes 2. The other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is not yet initialized; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `power` is 2**.
