Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and the logic to determine what will be printed.

1. `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration, but it is also not directly used in the provided code snippet.
3. `n` is the integer value provided by the user input.
4. `power` is calculated as `ceil(log2(n))` and is also explicitly stated to be equal to `n`.

The key point here is that `power` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`. Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` is equivalent to `2 ** n`.

Thus, the print statement `print(2 ** power)` will print `2` raised to the power of `n`, where `n` is the integer value provided by the user input.

Output: **2 ** n (where n is the integer value provided by the user input)**
