Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` remains unchanged unless `n` is 1, in which case no further changes to `n` are specified; `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power ≥ `n` if `n` is not equal to 1. If `n` is 1, `power` is not defined. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power ≥ `n` minus 1, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**
