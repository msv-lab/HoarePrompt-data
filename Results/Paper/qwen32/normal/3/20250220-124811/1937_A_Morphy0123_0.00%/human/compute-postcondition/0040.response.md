The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but its specific value is not provided. The variable `n_cases` remains unchanged as an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is an input integer.**
