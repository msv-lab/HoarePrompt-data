The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about variables like `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`, but these do not influence the output of the `print(1)` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a range between 1 and 10,000.
2. The variable `i` is mentioned to be not yet initialized.
3. The variable `n` is currently set to the integer value 1.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print(1)` statement. The statement directly prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
