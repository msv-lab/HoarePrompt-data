To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `power` and `n`. According to the loop condition, the loop will continue to execute as long as `power` is less than `log2(n)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `power` is 3.

We need to ensure that `power` is still less than `log2(n)` for the loop to execute one more time. Since `power` is currently 3, we need to make sure that `log2(n)` is greater than 3. This means `n` must be greater than \(2^3\), which is 8.

Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 8 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` must be greater than 8; `power` is 3**
