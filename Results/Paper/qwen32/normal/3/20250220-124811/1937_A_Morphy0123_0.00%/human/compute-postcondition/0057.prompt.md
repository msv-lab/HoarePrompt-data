Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        while power < log2(n):
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is not yet initialized; `n` is an integer. If `n` is 1, the program does not modify any variables. Otherwise, `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `power` is the largest integer such that 2^(`power` + 1) is greater than or equal to `n`. If `power` was originally equal to `n`, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` is the integer value provided by the user input. If `n` equals 1, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is set to the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of `n` minus 1, unless `power` equals `n`, in which case `power` remains `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` remains unchanged unless `n` is 1, in which case no further changes to `n` are specified; `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power ≥ `n` if `n` is not equal to 1. If `n` is 1, `power` is not defined. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power ≥ `n` minus 1, and `power` is not equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
