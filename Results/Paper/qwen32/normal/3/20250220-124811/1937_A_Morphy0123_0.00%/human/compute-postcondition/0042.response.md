The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `power`. The variables `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is an input integer; `power` is 1.**
