The code snippet `current_key = num % x, num % y` updates the value of `current_key`. The new value of `current_key` is a tuple where the first element is `num % x` and the second element is `num % y`. The values of `num`, `x`, and `y` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least three elements; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is `2 * residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`; `r_x` is `-arr[2] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[2] % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is `arr[2]`.**
