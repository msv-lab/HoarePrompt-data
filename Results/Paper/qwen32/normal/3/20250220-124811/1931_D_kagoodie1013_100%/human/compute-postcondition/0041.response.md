Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `r_y` is recalculated using the expression `num % y`. Since `num` is already defined as `arr[2]`, the new value of `r_y` will be `arr[2] % y`.

Hereâ€™s the updated state:
- `r_y` is recalculated to `arr[2] % y`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least three elements; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`; `r_x` is `-arr[2] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[2] % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[2] % x, arr[2] % y)`; `num` is `arr[2]`.**
