Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each element in `arr`; `residue_map` has keys for each unique pair `(num % x, num % y)` with their values representing the number of occurrences of each pair in `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed for all elements in `arr`, the `count` variable will hold the total number of times pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` have been seen before in the loop. The `residue_map` will keep track of how many times each unique pair `(num % x, num % y)` appears in the list `arr`. The `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will remain unchanged from their initial state except for the `count` and `residue_map` which are updated during the loop's execution.
