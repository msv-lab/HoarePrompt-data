### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to examine the logic and the implementation of the `func_1` function, which processes each test case and counts the number of beautiful pairs.

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Beautiful Pair Definition**:
   - A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Mathematical Transformation**:
   - For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), we need \((a_i \mod x) + (a_j \mod x) \equiv 0 \mod x\). This can be rewritten as \(a_i \mod x = -a_j \mod x\).
   - For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), we need \((a_i \mod y) - (a_j \mod y) \equiv 0 \mod y\). This can be rewritten as \(a_i \mod y = a_j \mod y\).

3. **Efficient Counting**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the number of times each pair of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen so far.
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates \(r_x = -num \% x\) and \(r_y = num \% y\).
   - It then checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before using `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`. If it has, it increments the count by the number of times this pair has been seen.
   - Finally, it updates the `residue_map` with the current residue pair \((num \% x, num \% y)\).

#### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the program against the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - \(n = 6\), \(x = 5\), \(y = 2\), \(a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]\).
   - Beautiful pairs: \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\) and \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\).
   - The program correctly identifies these pairs and counts them.

2. **Other Test Cases**:
   - The program processes each test case similarly and correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs based on the provided logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The use of residue pairs and a dictionary to keep track of their occurrences ensures that the solution is efficient and correct.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
