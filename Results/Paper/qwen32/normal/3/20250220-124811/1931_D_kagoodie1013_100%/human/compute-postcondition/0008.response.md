The code snippet provided calculates `current_key` as a tuple containing `num % x` and `num % y`. However, `num` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `num` should be `arr[0]` based on the context of `r_x` being calculated as `-arr[0] % x`, we will proceed with that assumption.

Given that `arr` has at least one element, `arr[0]` is defined, and `x` and `y` are positive integers, the values of `num % x` and `num % y` can be calculated directly.

Let's denote `arr[0]` as `first_element` for clarity.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` (an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` (an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers, each integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `test_cases` must have at least one tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is `-arr[0] % x`; `r_y` is `x % y`; `current_key` is `(first_element % x, first_element % y)`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `test_cases` remains the same as the initial state, `results`, `count`, and `residue_map` remain unchanged, `r_x` and `r_y` remain as calculated, and `current_key` is a new variable that holds the tuple `(first_element % x, first_element % y)` where `first_element` is the first element of `arr`.
