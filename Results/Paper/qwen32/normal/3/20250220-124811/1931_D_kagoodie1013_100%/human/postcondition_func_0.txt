The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it computes a count based on specific residue conditions and returns a list of these counts. If the input list of test cases is empty, the function returns an empty list.
