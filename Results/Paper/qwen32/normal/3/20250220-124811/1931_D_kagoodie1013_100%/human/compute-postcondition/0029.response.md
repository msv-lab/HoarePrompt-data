The code snippet calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and assigns it to the variable `r_y`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The precondition specifies that `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` contains the current value of `count`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, and `r_x` is the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least one element; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`; `r_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.**
