The code snippet provided is `r_x = -num % x`. This line recalculates the value of `r_x` using the current value of `num` and `x`.

Given the Initial State:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least three elements.
- `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`.
- `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
- `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`.
- `r_x` is the remainder of `-arr[2]` divided by `x`.
- `r_y` is `arr[2] % y`.
- `current_key` is `(arr[2] % x, arr[2] % y)`.
- `num` is `arr[2]`.
- The value of `residue_map[current_key]` has been incremented by 1.

The code `r_x = -num % x` will change the value of `r_x` to the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`. Since `num` is `arr[2]`, the new value of `r_x` will be `-arr[2] % x`.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `residue_map`, `r_y`, `current_key`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least three elements; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`; `r_x` is `-arr[2] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[2] % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[2] % x, arr[2] % y)`; `num` is `arr[2]`.**
