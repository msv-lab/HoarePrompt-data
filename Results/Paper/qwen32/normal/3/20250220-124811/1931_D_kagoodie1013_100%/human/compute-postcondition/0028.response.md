The code snippet provided is:
```
r_x = -num % x
```

Given the initial state, the variable `num` is not defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, `num` likely refers to one of the elements in the tuples within the `test_cases` list. Since `num` is not specified, we will assume `num` is a variable that will be defined in the context of the loop or function that this code is part of. For the purpose of this task, we will proceed with the assumption that `num` is a valid integer.

The operation `-num % x` calculates the negative of `num` modulo `x`. This means it first negates the value of `num` and then finds the remainder when the negated value is divided by `x`.

Since `r_x` is being assigned the result of this operation, the value of `r_x` will be the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least one element; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`.**
