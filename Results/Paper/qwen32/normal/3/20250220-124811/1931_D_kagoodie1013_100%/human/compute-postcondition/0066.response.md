The code snippet updates the `current_key` variable to be a tuple consisting of the remainder of `num` when divided by `x` and the remainder of `num` when divided by `y`.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are already defined, and `num` is the next element in `arr`. The variables `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `residue_map`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and the previous `current_key` do not change in this code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` is a dictionary where the key `(num % x, num % y)` has its value incremented by 1; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

In simple terms, `current_key` is now set to a new tuple `(num % x, num % y)`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
