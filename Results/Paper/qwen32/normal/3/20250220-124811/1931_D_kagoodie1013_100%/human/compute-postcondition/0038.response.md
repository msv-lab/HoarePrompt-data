Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least one element; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`; `r_x` is the remainder of `-arr[1]` divided by `x`; `r_y` is `arr[1] % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y)`; `num` is `arr[1]`. The value of `residue_map[current_key]` has been incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value associated with `current_key` in the `residue_map` dictionary has been increased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
