The code snippet increments the `count` variable by the value retrieved from `residue_map` using the key `(r_x, r_y)`. If the key does not exist in the dictionary, `get` returns 0. Since `residue_map` is initially an empty dictionary, the value for the key `(r_x, r_y)` will be 0.

Therefore, `count` remains 0 as it was initially.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` (an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` (an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers, each integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `test_cases` must have at least one tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is `-arr[0] % x`; `r_y` is `x % y`.**
