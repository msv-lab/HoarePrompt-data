The code snippet updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count associated with the `current_key` by 1. The `current_key` is composed of the remainders of `num` when divided by `x` and `y`. 

Given that `residue_map` was initially an empty dictionary, the first time this code runs, it will set `residue_map[current_key]` to 1. If `current_key` already exists in `residue_map`, its value will be incremented by 1.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `r_x`, `r_y`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least one element; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`; `r_x` is the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`; `r_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**.
