Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is a dictionary with each residue pair `(num % x, num % y)` mapped to the number of times it has been encountered.**

In simple terms, the variable `count` has been reset to 0, while all other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `residue_map`) remain unchanged.
