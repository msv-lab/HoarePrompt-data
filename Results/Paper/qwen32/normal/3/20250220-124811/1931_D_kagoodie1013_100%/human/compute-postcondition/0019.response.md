Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` has the key `(first_element % x, first_element % y)` with its value incremented by 1 and the key `current_key` with its value incremented by 1; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[2] % x, arr[2] % y)`; `num` is `arr[2]`.**

Explanation: The variable `count` is incremented by the value retrieved from `residue_map` using the key `(r_x, r_y)`. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given line of code.
