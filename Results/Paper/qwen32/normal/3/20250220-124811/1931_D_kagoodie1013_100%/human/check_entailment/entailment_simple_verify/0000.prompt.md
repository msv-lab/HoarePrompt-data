You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`. This is done correctly by splitting the input string and mapping the values appropriately.

2. **Logic for Finding Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the number of pairs `(num % x, num % y)` encountered so far.
   - For each number `num` in the array, it calculates `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`. The reason for using `-num % x` is to ensure that the condition `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` when combined with the stored residues.
   - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it means there are numbers previously encountered that can form a beautiful pair with the current number, so it adds the count of such pairs to the total count.
   - It updates `residue_map` with the current number's residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. It efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs using a dictionary to store and look up residues, which ensures that the solution works within the given constraints.

Since the program correctly handles the input, logic, and output as per the problem description, it is correct for all potential cases.
