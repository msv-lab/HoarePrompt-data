The code snippet assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `cliquess[left + mid + 2]` is set to `clique`.

The initial state specifies that `cliques[left + mid + 2]` is already `clique`, so the assignment does not change the value of `cliques[left + mid + 2]`. Therefore, no changes occur to the state of the variables.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `cliques[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `arr[left + mid]` is `big_element`; `cliques[left + mid]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 1]` is `big_element - 1`; `cliques[left + mid + 1]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 2]` is `big_element - 2`; `cliques[left + mid + 2]` is `clique`; `i` is 2.**
