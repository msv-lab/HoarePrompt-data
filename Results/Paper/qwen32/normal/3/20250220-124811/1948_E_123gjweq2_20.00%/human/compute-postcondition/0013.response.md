The provided code snippet is `cliquess[left + i] = clique`. This line of code assigns the value of `clique` to the index `left + i` in the `cliquess` list. Given the initial state, `clique` is an integer, and `left + i` is a valid index in the `cliquess` list.

Since the line of code does not change the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, `arr`, or `i`, those variables remain unchanged. The only change is that the element at index `left + i` in the `cliquess` list is now set to the value of `clique`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
