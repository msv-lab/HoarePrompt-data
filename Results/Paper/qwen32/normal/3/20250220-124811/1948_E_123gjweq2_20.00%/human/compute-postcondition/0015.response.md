The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range of the loop is determined by `not_mid`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `not_mid` must be at least 1. 

Given the initial state, `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`. To ensure `not_mid` is at least 1, we need to check the conditions under which this expression holds true.

Since `right - left >= 2`, let's analyze the expression:

- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`

For `not_mid` to be at least 1:
\[ right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2 \geq 1 \]

This inequality is always true when `right - left >= 2` because the smallest value for `right - left` is 2, which makes `mid` equal to 1 and `not_mid` equal to 2.

Therefore, the initial conditions already ensure that `not_mid` is at least 1, and no further adjustments are needed for `i` or `not_mid` specifically. However, we need to ensure that the initial state of `i` is correctly set before the loop starts, which is typically 0 for a `for` loop in Python.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `cliques[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `i` is 0**
