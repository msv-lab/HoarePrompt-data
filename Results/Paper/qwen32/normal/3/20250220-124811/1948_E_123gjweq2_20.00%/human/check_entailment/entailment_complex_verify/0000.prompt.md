You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2n.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2n, `cliques` is the ceiling of `n / k`, `arr` is a list of `n` elements where each segment of `k` consecutive elements is filled with the corresponding clique number (1, 2, ..., `cliques`), `cliquess` is a list of `n` elements where each segment of `k` consecutive elements is filled with the corresponding clique number (1, 2, ..., `cliques`), `i` is `cliques - 1`.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: [1 repeated k times, 2 repeated k times, ..., cliques repeated (n - (cliques-1)*k) times] (where cliques is the ceiling of n/k)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is the ceiling of n / k)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 ... 1 (k times) 2 2 2 ... 2 (k times) ... cliques cliques ... cliques (remainder times if remainder > 0, otherwise cliques-1 cliques ... cliques (k times)) (where each number from 1 to cliques appears k times, filling up to n elements)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and `2n` inclusive. It calculates the ceiling of `n / k` to determine the number of cliques. The function then creates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, each of length `n`, and fills them with numbers representing the clique to which each index belongs, with each clique number repeated up to `k` times. Finally, it prints the list `arr`, the number of cliques, and the list `cliquess`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), and clique is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices in the range [left, right] will be assigned.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `cliques[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for `i` in `[0, not_mid)`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, not_mid)`; `i` is `not_mid - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` modifies a portion of the array `arr` by assigning values from `left + 1` to `right + 1` in a specific pattern to the elements in the range from `left` to `right` (inclusive). It also assigns the given `clique` number to each element in this range in the array `cliquess`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are some issues:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without declaring them as global. This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior because these variables are not initialized within the functions.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliques`**: The calculation of `cliques` in `func_1` is incorrect. The number of cliques is not simply the ceiling of `n / k`. The problem requires a more nuanced approach to determine the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints.

3. **Incorrect Array Assignment**: The function `make_array` does not correctly assign the values to `arr` and `cliquess`. The logic for assigning values and cliques does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the results directly from the functions, which is not suitable for handling multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The results should be collected and printed after processing all test cases.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is small or `k` is large, the current logic may not produce the correct number of cliques or the correct partition.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program might output:

```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```

However, this output might not satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs of vertices. For instance, for `i = 1` and `j = 3`, `|1 - 3| + |3 - 5| = 2 + 2 = 4`, which is equal to `k`, but the vertices 1 and 3 are in different cliques (1 and 2 respectively), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description and fails to handle various edge cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.
