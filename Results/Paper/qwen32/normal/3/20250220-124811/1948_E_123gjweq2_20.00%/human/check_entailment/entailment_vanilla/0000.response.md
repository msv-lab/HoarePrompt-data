Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
    - This function is intended to assign integers to vertices and partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques.
    - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which seems like a reasonable initial guess for the minimum number of cliques, but it does not guarantee the optimal solution.
    - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, which are supposed to store the integer assignments and clique assignments for each vertex, respectively.
    - It then calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the start and end indices of the vertices in the current clique and the clique number.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
    - This function assigns integers to the vertices in the range `[left, right]` and assigns them to the specified `clique`.
    - It calculates `small_element`, `big_element`, and the midpoint `mid` of the range.
    - It assigns the first `mid` elements in ascending order starting from `small_element` and the remaining elements in descending order starting from `big_element`.
    - It assigns the clique number to each vertex in the range.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Global Variables**:
    - The `arr` and `cliquess` variables used in `make_array` are not defined within its scope. They are expected to be global variables, but they are not declared as such. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for Assigning Integers and Cliques**:
    - The logic for assigning integers and cliques does not guarantee that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
    - The program assigns integers in a specific pattern (ascending and then descending) but does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds for all pairs of vertices in each clique.

3. **Output**:
    - The program does not ensure that the output format is correct or that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to produce a correct solution for all test cases. The logic for assigning integers and cliques is flawed, and the program does not handle the constraints properly.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
