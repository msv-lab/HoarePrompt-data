The code snippet modifies the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`. Given the initial state, we know the values of `left`, `mid`, `i`, and `big_element`.

- `left` is an integer such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`
- `right - left >= 2`
- `clique` is an integer
- `small_element` is `left + 1`
- `big_element` is `right + 1`
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`
- `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`
- `cliques[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`
- `arr[left + mid]` is `big_element`
- `cliques[left + mid]` is `clique`
- `i` is 1

Given these conditions, the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` changes to `big_element - i`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `cliques[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `arr[left + mid]` is `big_element`; `cliques[left + mid]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 1]` is `big_element - 1`; `i` is 1.**
