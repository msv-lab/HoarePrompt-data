Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are some issues:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without declaring them as global. This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior because these variables are not initialized within the functions.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliques`**: The calculation of `cliques` in `func_1` is incorrect. The number of cliques is not simply the ceiling of `n / k`. The problem requires a more nuanced approach to determine the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints.

3. **Incorrect Array Assignment**: The function `make_array` does not correctly assign the values to `arr` and `cliquess`. The logic for assigning values and cliques does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the results directly from the functions, which is not suitable for handling multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The results should be collected and printed after processing all test cases.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is small or `k` is large, the current logic may not produce the correct number of cliques or the correct partition.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program might output:

```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```

However, this output might not satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs of vertices. For instance, for `i = 1` and `j = 3`, `|1 - 3| + |3 - 5| = 2 + 2 = 4`, which is equal to `k`, but the vertices 1 and 3 are in different cliques (1 and 2 respectively), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description and fails to handle various edge cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.
