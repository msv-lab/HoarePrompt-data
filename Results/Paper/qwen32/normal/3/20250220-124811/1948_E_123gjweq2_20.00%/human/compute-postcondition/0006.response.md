The code modifies the elements of the array `arr` starting from the index `left` up to `left + i`. Specifically, it sets `arr[left + i]` to `small_element + i`. Given the initial state, `small_element` is `left + 1`, so `arr[left + i]` becomes `(left + 1) + i`.

Let's break it down:
- `left` and `right` remain integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`.
- `clique` remains unchanged.
- `small_element` remains `left + 1`.
- `big_element` remains `right + 1`.
- `mid` remains `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` remains `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.
- `arr[left + i]` is updated to `(left + 1) + i`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i`.**
