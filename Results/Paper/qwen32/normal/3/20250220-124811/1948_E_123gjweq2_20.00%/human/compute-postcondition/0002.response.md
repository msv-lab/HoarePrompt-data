The code calculates the midpoint between `small_element` and `big_element` and assigns it to `mid`. Given the initial state, `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`. Therefore, `mid` will be calculated as `((right + 1) - (left + 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(right - left) // 2`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices in the range [left, right] will be assigned, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.**
