To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the given initial conditions and the loop's behavior.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Loop Range:** The loop runs for `mid` iterations, where `mid = (right - left) // 2`.
- **Loop Body:**
  - For each iteration `i` in the range `[0, mid)`, the following assignments are made:
    - `arr[left + i] = small_element + i` which translates to `arr[left + i] = (left + 1) + i`
    - `cliquess[left + i] = clique`

### Output State after All Iterations:
- **`arr` Modifications:**
  - The first `mid` elements starting from `left` will be set to the values `(left + 1), (left + 2), ..., (left + mid)`.
- **`cliquess` Modifications:**
  - The first `mid` elements starting from `left` will be set to the value `clique`.

### Final Output State:
- The variables `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged.
- The `arr` array will have the first `mid` elements starting from index `left` set to consecutive values starting from `(left + 1)`.
- The `cliquess` array will have the first `mid` elements starting from index `left` set to the value `clique`.

### Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop completes all its iterations, the first `mid` elements of the `arr` array starting from index `left` will be filled with consecutive integers starting from `(left + 1)`. Similarly, the first `mid` elements of the `cliquess` array starting from index `left` will all be set to the value of `clique`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid`) remain unchanged.
