### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Issues Identified in the Program:

1. **Global Variables**:
   - The variables `arr` and `cliquess` are used in both `func_1` and `make_array` without being declared as global. This will lead to `UnboundLocalError` because these variables are not recognized within the local scope of the functions.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliques`**:
   - The calculation of `cliques` using `ceil(n / k)` is a simplification that does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques. The number of cliques should be determined based on the constraints `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs of vertices.

3. **Incorrect Array Assignment**:
   - The function `make_array` does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices in the same clique. The current logic for assigning values and cliques is flawed.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the results directly from the functions, which is not suitable for handling multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The results should be collected and printed after processing all test cases.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is small or `k` is large, the current logic may not produce the correct number of cliques or the correct partition.

#### Function Summary Analysis:

- **Function `make_array`**:
  - The function `make_array` is supposed to fill a portion of `arr` and `cliquess` with specific values and clique numbers. However, the logic provided does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

#### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program might output:

```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```

However, this output might not satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs of vertices. For instance, for `i = 1` and `j = 3`, `|1 - 3| + |3 - 5| = 2 + 2 = 4`, which is equal to `k`, but the vertices 1 and 3 are in different cliques (1 and 2 respectively), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description and fails to handle various edge cases. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
