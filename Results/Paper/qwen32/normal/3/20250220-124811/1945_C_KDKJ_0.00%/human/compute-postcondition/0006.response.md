To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the number of times the loop runs, which is determined by the input to `int(input())`. Let's denote this input by `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, calling `func_1()` in each iteration.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the variable `count` is incremented in each iteration of the loop. After 3 iterations, `count` is 2, implying that `count` was initialized to 0 before the loop started. Therefore, after `n` iterations, `count` will be `n-1`.

Since the problem does not specify any other variables or state changes within `func_1()`, we will assume that `func_1()` does not affect any variables outside of itself and `count` is the only variable that changes as a result of the loop.

Thus, after `n` iterations, the output state will be:

Output State: **`count` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all the iterations as specified by the input `n`, the variable `count` will have a value of `n-1`.
