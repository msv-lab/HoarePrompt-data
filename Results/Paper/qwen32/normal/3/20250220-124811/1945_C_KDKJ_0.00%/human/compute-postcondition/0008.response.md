Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It performs a loop that runs a number of times specified by the user input, calling `func_1` during each iteration. The final state of the program after it concludes depends on the actions performed by `func_1` during each iteration, but `func_2` itself does not return any specific value.**
