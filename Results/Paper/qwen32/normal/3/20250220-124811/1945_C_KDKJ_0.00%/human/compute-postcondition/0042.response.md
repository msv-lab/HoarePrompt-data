The code snippet updates the value of `rsum` by subtracting `lsum` from `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], ..., [count_0, count_not_0]]`; `ans` is 0; `satisfy` is 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `left` is `S[1][0]`; `lsum` is `left + S[1][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`; `rsum` is `n - lsum`. If either `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` holds true, the condition remains as is. Otherwise, `ans` satisfies the condition `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`**
