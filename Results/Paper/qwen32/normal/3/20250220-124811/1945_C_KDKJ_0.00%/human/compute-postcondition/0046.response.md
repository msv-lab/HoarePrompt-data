Postcondition: **`S` is `[[0, 0], ..., [count_0, count_not_0]]`; `ans` is 1 if `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)` holds true when `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `satisfy` is 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `left` is `S[1][0]`; `lsum` is `left + S[1][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`; `rsum` is `n - lsum`. The condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` remains unchanged. If neither condition is true, `ans` is updated based on the comparison `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`.**
