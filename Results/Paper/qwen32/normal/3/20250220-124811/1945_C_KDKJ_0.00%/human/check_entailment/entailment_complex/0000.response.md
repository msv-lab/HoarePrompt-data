### Reasoning:

The given code is designed to solve the problem of determining the optimal position to build a road that divides the village into two sides, such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side of the street. Let's break down the code and verify its correctness:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Input**: Reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
    - **Process**:
        - Initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]`. This list will store cumulative counts of '0's and '1's as it iterates through the string `a`.
        - Iterates through each character in `a`. For each character:
            - If the character is '0', it increments the count of '0's.
            - If the character is '1', it increments the count of '1's.
            - Appends the updated counts to `S`.
        - Initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the optimal position to place the road.
        - Iterates through each possible position `i` where the road could be placed:
            - Calculates the number of '0's (`left`) and the total number of elements (`lsum`) to the left of the road.
            - Calculates the number of '1's (`right`) and the total number of elements (`rsum`) to the right of the road.
            - Checks if the number of '0's to the left is at least half of the total elements to the left (`left * 2 >= lsum`) and if the number of '1's to the right is at least half of the total elements to the right (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
            - If both conditions are satisfied, checks if this position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found optimal position `ans`. If it is, updates `ans`.
    - **Output**: Prints the optimal position `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Process**: Reads the number of test cases and runs `func_1` for each test case.
    - **Output**: None, but `func_1` prints the result for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
    - The function correctly calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's using the list `S`.
    - It checks the conditions for each possible position `i` to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
    - It correctly finds the position `i` closest to the middle of the village that satisfies the conditions.
- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
    - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes it to find the optimal position for the road, and outputs the result. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
