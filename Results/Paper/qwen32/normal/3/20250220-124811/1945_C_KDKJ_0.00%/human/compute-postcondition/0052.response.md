The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the conditions of the loop. Therefore, none of the variables in the initial state are changed by this statement.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], ..., [count_0, count_not_0]]`; `ans` is 1 if `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)` holds true when `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `satisfy` is 0; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `left` is `S[2][0]`; `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`. The condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` remains unchanged.**
