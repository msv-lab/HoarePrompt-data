The code snippet `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the values of the last element in the list `S` to the variables `x` and `y`. Given the initial state, the last element of `S` is `[x, y]`. After the assignment, the variables `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last element of `S`.

If `s` equals '0', then `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`. Since the assignment `x, y = S[-1]` does not change the values of `x` and `y` in the list `S`, the values of `x` and `y` remain the same as they were before the assignment.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of houses, `a` is a non-empty string input by the user, `s` is the second character of the string `a`, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`. If `s` equals '0', `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`.**
