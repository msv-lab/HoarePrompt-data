To determine the output state, we need to know the definition of the function `func_1()`. Since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables or any return values. However, based on the given initial state and the function call, we can infer that `func_1()` might modify the variable `count` or introduce new variables, but without the function definition, we can only assume that `count` might be altered.

Given the lack of function details, let's consider the most straightforward scenario where `func_1()` does not modify any variables or introduce new ones. If `func_1()` does not change `count`, then `count` remains 2. If `func_1()` modifies `count`, we would need the function's definition to determine the new value of `count`.

Since the function definition is not provided, we will assume `func_1()` does not change `count` and does not introduce any new variables or return any values.

Output State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 1, and the remaining number of iterations is greater than 0; `count` is 2.**
