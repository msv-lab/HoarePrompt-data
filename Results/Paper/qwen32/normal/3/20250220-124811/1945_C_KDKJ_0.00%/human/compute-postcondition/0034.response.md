Postcondition: **`S` is `[[0, 0], ..., [count_0, count_not_0]]`; `ans` is an integer such that `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`; `satisfy` is 0; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `left` is 0; `lsum` is 0; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`; `rsum` is `n`. Additionally, `left * 2` is greater than or equal to `lsum` and `right * 2` is greater than or equal to `rsum`. The current value of `ans` satisfies the condition `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`**
