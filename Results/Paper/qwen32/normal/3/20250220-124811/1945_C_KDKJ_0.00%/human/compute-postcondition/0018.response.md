The code snippet `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the values of the last sublist in the list `S` to the variables `x` and `y`. Given the initial state where `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]`, the last sublist is `[x, y]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `x` and `y` will take the values from the last sublist of `S`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `x` and `y` in the last sublist, we can only say that `x` and `y` are assigned the values from that sublist. The values of `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of houses, `a` is a non-empty string input by the user with at least 3 characters, `s` is the third character of the string `a`, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]`, `x` and `y` are the values from the last sublist of `S`**.
