To determine the Output State, we need to understand the impact of `func_1()` on the existing state. However, the initial state does not include any variables or values that `func_1()` might affect, and the function `func_1()` itself is not defined in the provided context. Therefore, we can only assume that `func_1()` does not change any existing variables or introduce new ones based on the given information.

Since there are no variables or values mentioned in the initial state that `func_1()` could affect, and no specific behavior of `func_1()` is provided, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer.**
