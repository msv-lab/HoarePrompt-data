Postcondition: **`S` is `[[0, 0], ..., [count_0, count_not_0]]`; `ans` is 2 if `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)` holds true, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `satisfy` is 0; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `left` is `S[2][0]`; `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`. The condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` remains unchanged.**
