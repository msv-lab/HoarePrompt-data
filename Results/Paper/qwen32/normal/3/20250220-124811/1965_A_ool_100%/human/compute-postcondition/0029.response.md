Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in the list represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function returns the string 'Alice' in Case_1, and in Case_2, it returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the value of `A` after it may have been flipped by `not_c`.**
