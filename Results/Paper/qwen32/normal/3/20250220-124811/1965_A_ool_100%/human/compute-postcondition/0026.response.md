The code snippet `A = not A` flips the boolean value of `A`. If `A` was `True`, it becomes `False`, and if `A` was `False`, it becomes `True`. 

Given the initial state, `A` is either `True` or `False` based on the number of unique elements in `set_` (excluding the first element). Since `not_c` remains `True` and the loop has completed all iterations without setting `not_c` to `False`, `not_c` remains unchanged.

If `A` was `True`, after the execution of the code, `A` becomes `False`. If `A` was `False`, after the execution of the code, `A` becomes `True`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`not_c` is `True`, `A` is `False` if it was `True` initially, and `A` is `True` if it was `False` initially.**
