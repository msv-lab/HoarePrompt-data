To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

The loop iterates over the `set_` list starting from the second element (index 1) and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If it finds such a difference, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it toggles the value of `A` (`A = not A`).

From the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
1. After the first iteration, `A` is `True` and `not_c` is `False` if there was a gap greater than 1 between the first two elements of `set_`.
2. After the second iteration, `A` is `False`.
3. After the third iteration, `A` is `True`.

This pattern indicates that `A` alternates between `True` and `False` with each iteration.

The loop will continue until it either finds a gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_` or until it has iterated through all elements in `set_`.

**Final Output State:**
- If `not_c` remains `True` after all iterations, it means there were no gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`. In this case, `A` will be `True` if the number of iterations (excluding the first element) is odd, and `False` if it is even.
- If `not_c` becomes `False` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks, and `A` will be `True` if the number of completed iterations (excluding the first element) is odd, and `False` if it is even.

Given the information and the pattern observed, the final output state can be described as follows:

If the loop completes all iterations without setting `not_c` to `False`, `A` will be `True` if the number of unique elements in `set_` (excluding the first element) is odd, and `False` if it is even. `not_c` will be `True`.

If the loop breaks due to finding a gap greater than 1, `not_c` will be `False`, and `A` will be `True` if the number of completed iterations (excluding the first element) is odd, and `False` if it is even.

Since the exact number of unique elements in `set_` is not provided, we will assume the loop completes all iterations without breaking. Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `A` is `True` if the number of unique elements in `set_` (excluding the first element) is odd, and `False` if it is even; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is `True`.**

In simpler terms, `A` will be `True` or `False` based on the number of unique elements in `set_` (excluding the first element), and `not_c` will be `True` if no gaps greater than 1 were found between consecutive elements.
