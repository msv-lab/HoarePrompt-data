The only variable in the loop head is `heap[0]`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. At the end of the last iteration, `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `heap[0]` remains less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since we are only allowed to adjust `heap[0]`, we can simply keep `heap[0]` as it is or adjust it to a value that is still less than or equal to `current_median`. For the loop to execute one more time, `heap[0]` must satisfy the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes the value `smallest + 1` such that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`**
