The code snippet `n, arr = test_cases[i]` assigns the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` to `n` and the second element (which is a list) to `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `n` (previous value), `arr` (previous value), `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, `operations`) remain unchanged except for `n` and `arr`.

Given that `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple and `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple, the output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of operations performed.**
