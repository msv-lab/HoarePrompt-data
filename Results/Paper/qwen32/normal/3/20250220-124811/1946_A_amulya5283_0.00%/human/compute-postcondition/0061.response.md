To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Given the current state:
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added.
- `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`.
- `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` must be true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `heap[0]` (the smallest element in the heap)
   - `current_median` (the median of the array `arr`)

2. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `heap[0]` should be less than or equal to `current_median`.
   - Since `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, we can ensure that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median` by adjusting `heap[0]` directly.

### Adjustment:
- We can set `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`.

### Final State:
- Since `heap` is a heapified list and `heap[0]` is the smallest element, we can adjust `heap[0]` to be any value less than or equal to `current_median`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added such that `heap[0] <= current_median`, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the second smallest element in the original heapified `arr[median_index:]`**
