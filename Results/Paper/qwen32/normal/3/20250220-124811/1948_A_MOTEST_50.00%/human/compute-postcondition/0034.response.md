Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an input integer and not equal to 1.
- `s` is the string "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".
- If `n` is even:
  - `ans` is set to "AABBCC".
  - `x` is set to 3.
  - `j` is set to 2.
- If `n` is odd:
  - `ans` is set to "AAABBBCCDDEE".
  - `x` is set to 5.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `ans`, `x`, and `j` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of these variables and will always output `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
