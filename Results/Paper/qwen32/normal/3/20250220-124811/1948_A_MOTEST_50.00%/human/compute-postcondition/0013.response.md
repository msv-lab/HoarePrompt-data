The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `x` was 0, so the new value of `x` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an even integer and not equal to 1, `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", `ans` is "AA", `x` is 1, `j` is 0.
