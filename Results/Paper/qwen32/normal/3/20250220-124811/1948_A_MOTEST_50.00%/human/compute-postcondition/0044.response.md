The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. The initial value of `x` is 0, so after the increment, `x` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is "AA"; `x` is 1**.
