You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n`. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by a constructed string of length `n` using uppercase letters from the alphabet, ensuring that the string is balanced with pairs of letters. If `n` is odd, the string starts with "AAA" followed by pairs of letters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Key Points:
1. **Special Character**: A character is special if it has exactly one neighbor that is the same as itself.
2. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= t <= 50` (number of test cases)
   - `1 <= n <= 50` (number of special characters required)
3. **Output**:
   - If no such string exists, print "NO".
   - Otherwise, print "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Observations:
- For `n = 1`, it is impossible to have a single special character because having one special character would require at least two characters, and both would have to be the same, making both characters special.
- For `n > 1`:
  - If `n` is even, we can construct a string such that every pair of consecutive characters is the same, and the pattern alternates, ensuring each character has exactly one neighbor that is the same. For example, for `n = 4`, the string "AABBCC" works.
  - If `n` is odd, we need to ensure that we still have exactly `n` special characters. We can start with "AAA" (which has 2 special characters) and then follow the same pattern as for even `n` for the remaining `n-2` special characters. For example, for `n = 5`, the string "AAABBCC" works.

### Program Analysis:
- The program starts by clearing the console, which is not necessary for solving the problem and can be ignored for correctness.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of special characters `n`.
- If `n == 1`, it correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character.
- For `n > 1`, it constructs the string:
  - If `n` is even, it constructs a string with pairs of consecutive identical characters.
  - If `n` is odd, it starts with "AAA" and then constructs the rest of the string similarly to the even case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the edge cases and constructs valid strings for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
