To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code snippet on the variables. 

The code snippet is:
```python
ans += s[x] * 2
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` must be at least 4.
- `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".
- `i` is 2.
- `ans` is "AA".
- `x` is increased by 1, so `x` is now 1 (assuming it was 0 before the increment).
- `j` is 1.

The code snippet appends to `ans` the character at index `x` in the string `s`, repeated twice. Since `x` is 1, the character at index 1 in `s` is "B". Therefore, "BB" is appended to `ans`.

Thus, `ans` changes from "AA" to "AABB".

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `x`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 4, `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", `i` is 2, `ans` is "AABB", `x` is 1, `j` is 1.**
