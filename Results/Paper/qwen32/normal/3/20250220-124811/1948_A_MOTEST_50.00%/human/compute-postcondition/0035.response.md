To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that `t >= 1` (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is mentioned for completeness).
- `n` is an input integer and not equal to 1.
- `s` is the string "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".

### Conditions:
- If `n` is even:
  - `ans` is set to "AABBCC".
  - `x` is set to 3.
  - `j` is set to 2.
- If `n` is odd:
  - `ans` is set to "AAABBBCCDDEE".
  - `x` is set to 5.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet `print(ans)` will print the value of the variable `ans`. Based on the conditions given:
- If `n` is even, `ans` is "AABBCC".
- If `n` is odd, `ans` is "AAABBBCCDDEE".

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we cannot determine whether `n` is even or odd. However, we can provide the possible outputs based on the conditions.

### Conclusion:
- If `n` is even, the output will be "AABBCC".
- If `n` is odd, the output will be "AAABBBCCDDEE".

Given that we do not have the specific value of `n`, we describe the output based on the conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is "AABBCC" if n is even, and "AAABBBCCDDEE" if n is odd)**
