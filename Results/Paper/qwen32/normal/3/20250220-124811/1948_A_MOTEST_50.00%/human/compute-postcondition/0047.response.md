The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `x` was 1, so the new value of `x` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is "AABB"; `x` is 2; `j` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is "AABB"; `x` is 2; `j` is 1.**
