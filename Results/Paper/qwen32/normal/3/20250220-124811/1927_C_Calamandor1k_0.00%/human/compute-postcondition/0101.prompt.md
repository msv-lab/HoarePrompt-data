Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of the list `a`; `len_b` is the length of the new list `b`; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0; `d` is `k // 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
    if len_a > i + 1:
        if a[i] <= k:
            count_a += 1
    if len_b > i + 1:
        if b[i] <= k:
            count_b += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `len_a` greater than 0; `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input with `len_b` being 0 or any positive integer; `d` is `k // 2`; `i` is 0. If `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, `count_a` is set to 1 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_a` is set to 0. If `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, `count_b` is set to 1 if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_b` remains 0. If `len_b` is not greater than `i + 1`, `count_b` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `len_a` greater than 0; `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input with `len_b` being 0 or any positive integer; `d` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1. If `len_a > i + 1` and `a[i] <= k`, then `count_a` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count_a` remains unchanged. If `len_b > i + 1` and `b[i] <= k`, then `count_b` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count_b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `len_a` greater than 0, `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input with `len_b` being 0 or any positive integer, `d` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 2. If `len_a > i + 1` and `a[i] <= k`, `count_a` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_a` remains unchanged. If `len_b > i + 1` and `b[i] <= k`, `count_b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_b` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
