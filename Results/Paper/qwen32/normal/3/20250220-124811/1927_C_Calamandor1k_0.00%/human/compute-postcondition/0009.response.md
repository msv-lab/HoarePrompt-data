Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1; `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0; `d` is `k // 2`; the current value of `i` is such that `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`.**
