Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `len_a` greater than 0; `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input with `len_b` being 0 or any positive integer; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0; `d` is `k // 2`; `i` is 0 and `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`.**
