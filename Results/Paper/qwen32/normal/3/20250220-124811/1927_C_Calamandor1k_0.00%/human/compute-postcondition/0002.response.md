The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will include the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input.**
