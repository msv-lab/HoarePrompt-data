Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1; `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1; `i` is incremented by 1; `count_a` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `count_a` has been increased by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
