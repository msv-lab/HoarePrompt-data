### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get in a card game where you and Nene each have `n` cards, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. The points are awarded when you place a card on the table that matches a card already on the table.

The key insight is that you can score a point only when you place a card that has already been placed by Nene. Since Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, the best strategy for you is to try and match pairs where possible.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
   - It counts the number of integers in `a` that appear exactly twice using a `Counter`.
   - It calculates the number of such pairs.
   - It returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. This makes sense because you can only score points on your turns (half of the total turns), and the maximum number of points you can score is limited by the number of pairs you have.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, a)` and stores the result.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

### Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided test cases.

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `4`, `1 1 2 3`
   - Pairs in your hand: `1` (appears twice)
   - Minimum of pairs and `n // 2`: `min(1, 4 // 2) = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `8`, `7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5`
   - Pairs in your hand: `8` and `5` (appear twice each)
   - Minimum of pairs and `n // 2`: `min(2, 8 // 2) = 2`
   - Expected Output: `2`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `8`, `7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6`
   - Pairs in your hand: `4` (appears twice)
   - Minimum of pairs and `n // 2`: `min(1, 8 // 2) = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `1 2 3`
   - Pairs in your hand: `None` (no number appears twice)
   - Minimum of pairs and `n // 2`: `min(0, 3 // 2) = 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `1`, `1`
   - Pairs in your hand: `None` (no number appears twice)
   - Minimum of pairs and `n // 2`: `min(0, 1 // 2) = 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get based on the given logic. It handles all the test cases as expected.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
