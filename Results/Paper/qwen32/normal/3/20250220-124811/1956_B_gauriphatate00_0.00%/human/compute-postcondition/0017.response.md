The code snippet appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list. This means that `results` will now have an additional element, which is the result of the function call `func_1(n, a)`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, and `t`) remain unchanged as they are not modified in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `idx` is `3 + n + n`; `t` must be greater than 1; `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**.
