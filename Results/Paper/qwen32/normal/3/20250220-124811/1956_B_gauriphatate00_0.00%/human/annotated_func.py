#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. It returns the minimum value between the number of integers in `a` that appear exactly 2 times and half of `n`.

    for result in results:

    #State: results is a list containing all elements corresponding to the number of iterations, and `result` is each element in the list sequentially.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input data representing multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of cards `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it computes and prints a result indicating the distribution of cards to two players such that each player receives `n` cards and the sum of the cards each player receives is as close as possible.
