Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]` from the last iteration, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]` from the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `idx` is `1 + Î£(n_i) for i in range(t)`, `t` is the total number of iterations, and `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)` for each of the `t` iterations.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` is the second element in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing at least three elements, `result` is the third element in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
