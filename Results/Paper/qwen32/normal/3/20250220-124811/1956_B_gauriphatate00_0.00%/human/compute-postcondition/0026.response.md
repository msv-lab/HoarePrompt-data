The `print(result)` statement is attempting to print a variable named `result`. However, based on the initial state provided, there is a variable named `results` (plural) which is a list containing at least one element. The variable `result` (singular) is not mentioned or defined in the initial state.

Given the information:
- `results` is a list with at least one element.
- `result` is not defined.

Since `result` is not defined in the initial state, this code will raise a `NameError` because the variable `result` is not found. However, based on the task instructions, we should describe the output as precisely as possible using the given information.

Output: **NameError: name 'result' is not defined**
