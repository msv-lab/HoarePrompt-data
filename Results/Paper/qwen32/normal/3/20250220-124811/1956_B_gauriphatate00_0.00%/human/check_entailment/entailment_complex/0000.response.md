### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score in a card game where each player has `n` cards, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck. The key is to understand how Nene, playing optimally, will minimize your score while maximizing her own.

#### Analysis of `func_1(n, a)`:
- **Input**: `n` is the number of cards each player has, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the cards in your hand.
- **Process**: 
  - It counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand (`pairs`).
  - It returns the minimum between `pairs` and `n // 2`.
- **Output**: This is the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally. The logic is that you can score a point for each pair of cards you have if Nene doesn't block them by playing the same card first. Since Nene plays optimally, she will block your pairs if she can, but you can still secure points for pairs that she cannot block entirely.

#### Analysis of `func_2()`:
- **Input**: Reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- **Process**:
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `a` of cards in your hand.
  - It calls `func_1(n, a)` to compute the result for that test case.
  - It stores the result in a list and prints all results at the end.
- **Output**: Prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum number of points you can score by considering the number of pairs you have and the fact that Nene will block your pairs optimally.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in implementing the logic described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
