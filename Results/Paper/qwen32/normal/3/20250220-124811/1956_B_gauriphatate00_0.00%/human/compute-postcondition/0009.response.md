The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` converts a slice of the `data` list (from index `idx` to `idx + n`) into integers and assigns it to the variable `a`. 

Given the initial state, `idx` is 2, and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`. This means that the slice `data[2:2 + n]` will be taken, converted to integers, and stored in `a`. The other variables (`data`, `t`, `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `idx` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**
