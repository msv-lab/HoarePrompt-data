Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2 * n]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `idx` is `4 + 2 * n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so `idx` becomes `3 + 2 * n + 1`, which simplifies to `4 + 2 * n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
