Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the given program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, you and Nene, who each receive `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards. Each card has an integer from `1` to `n`, and each integer appears exactly twice. Players take turns placing cards on a table, and a player earns a point if the card they place has already been placed on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can achieve if you play optimally.

### Key Observations

1. **Pairs and Points**: The maximum number of points you can earn is limited by the number of pairs of cards you have, because you can only earn a point when you place a card that has already been placed. If you have `k` pairs, you can earn at most `k` points.

2. **Nene's Optimal Play**: Nene will play in a way that maximizes her score and minimizes yours. However, since you are only interested in the maximum number of points you can earn, you can focus on maximizing the number of pairs you can use to earn points.

3. **Turns and Strategy**: Since there are `2n` turns in total, and each player takes `n` turns, you and Nene will each place `n` cards on the table. If you have `k` pairs, you can place `k` cards that will earn you points, and the remaining `n-k` cards will not earn you points.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions:

- **`func_1(n, a)`**: This function calculates the maximum number of points you can earn. It counts the number of pairs in your hand and returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. The reason for returning `min(pairs, n // 2)` is that you can only earn a point for each pair you have, but since there are `n` turns per player, you can only place `n` cards in total. Therefore, the maximum number of points you can earn is limited by the number of pairs you have and the number of turns you get, which is `n // 2`.

- **`func_2()`**: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Verification

The logic in `func_1` is correct because it accurately calculates the maximum number of points you can earn based on the number of pairs in your hand and the constraints of the game. The input handling in `func_2` is also correct, as it reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

### Conclusion

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the analysis above.

Correctness: **True**
