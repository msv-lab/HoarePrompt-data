Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of the function `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list. The values of `n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, and `t` remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains one element, which is the output of `func_1(n, a)`.
