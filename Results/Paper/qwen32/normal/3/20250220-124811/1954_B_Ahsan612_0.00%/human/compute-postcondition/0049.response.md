The value of `same` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `ar`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `ar` must have a length greater than 1, and the current value of `ar[i]` equals `num`; `same` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `ar` must have a length greater than 1, and the current value of `ar[i]` equals `num`; `same` is incremented by 1.**
