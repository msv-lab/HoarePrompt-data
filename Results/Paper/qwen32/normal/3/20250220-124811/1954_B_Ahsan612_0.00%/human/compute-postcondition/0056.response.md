The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` remain unchanged unless they were affected by conditions outside the provided code snippet. Given the initial state, `i` will now be 2 or 3, depending on its initial value.

Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `ar` has a length greater than 1, `same` is 1 if `ar[i]` did not equal `num` initially, otherwise `same` is incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` did not equal `num`, `num` is set to `ar[2]` and `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the previous value of `same`.**
