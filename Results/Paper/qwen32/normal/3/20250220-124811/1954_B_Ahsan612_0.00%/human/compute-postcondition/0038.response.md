To determine the output of the `print(minn)` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`ar`**: This is a list of elements that is being iterated over in a loop.
2. **`i`**: This is a loop counter that will continue until it equals the length of `ar`.
3. **`same`**: This variable holds the count of consecutive elements equal to `num` at the end of the last sequence of equal elements.
4. **`minn`**: This variable holds the minimum count of consecutive equal elements encountered during the entire iteration. It is explicitly stated that `minn` is not equal to `inf`, meaning it has been updated at least once during the iteration.
5. **`num`**: This variable holds the last unique number encountered in the list.

The loop will iterate through the list `ar`, counting sequences of consecutive equal elements and updating `minn` with the minimum count of such sequences encountered. After the loop terminates, `i` will be equal to the length of `ar`, and the final value of `minn` will be the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found in the list.

Given the precondition, the value of `minn` is a specific integer that represents the smallest number of consecutive equal elements found in the list `ar`.

Since the exact list `ar` and its contents are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `minn`. However, we know that `minn` holds the minimum count of consecutive equal elements encountered during the iteration.

Therefore, the output of the `print(minn)` statement will be the value of `minn`, which is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the list `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the list `ar`)**
