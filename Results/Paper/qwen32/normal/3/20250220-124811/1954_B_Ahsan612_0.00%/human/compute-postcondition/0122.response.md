Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum length of any contiguous subarray within `a` that contains only identical elements. If no such subarray exists, it prints `-1`.**
