You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum length of any contiguous subarray within `a` that contains only identical elements. If no such subarray exists, it prints `-1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic Error in Counting Minimum Elements to Remove:**
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same (`minn`) and uses this to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. However, this approach is flawed.
   - The program only considers the minimum length of consecutive identical elements but does not account for the possibility of removing elements in a way that disrupts the "beautiful" condition more effectively.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing fewer elements than the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The program will determine that the minimum length of consecutive identical elements is 1, but the correct answer is 1, as removing any single element (e.g., the middle `1`) will make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Incorrect Output for Single Element Arrays:**
   - The program outputs `-1` for single-element arrays, which is incorrect. A single-element array is already non-beautiful by definition, so the correct output should be `0`.

4. **Incorrect Output for Arrays with All Elements Identical:**
   - The program outputs `-1` for arrays where all elements are identical, which is incorrect. As explained in the problem statement, an array with all identical elements cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so the correct output should be `-1`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` as removing any single element (e.g., the middle `1`) will make the array non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one needs to identify the longest sequence of elements that can be made identical by the given operation and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to disrupt this sequence. This involves a more complex analysis of the array structure and cannot be solved simply by finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
