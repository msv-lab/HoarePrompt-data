Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input value must be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The input value `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1. `i` is 2. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 and `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `minn` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented to 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: 
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`, `len(ar)` must be `len(ar) + 1`. If `ar[i] == num`, `same` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, an `IndexError` is raised and `same` is 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
