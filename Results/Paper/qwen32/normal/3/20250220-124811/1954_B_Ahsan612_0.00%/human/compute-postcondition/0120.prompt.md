Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will continue until `i` is equal to the length of `ar`. `same` will hold the count of consecutive elements equal to `num` at the end of the last sequence of equal elements. `minn` will hold the minimum count of consecutive equal elements encountered during the entire iteration, updated to be the minimum between its current value and `same` if `minn` was not initially `inf`. `num` will hold the last unique number encountered in the list. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it remains `inf`; otherwise, it is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements. `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` after the loop terminates.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is 1 if the last sequence of consecutive elements in `ar` has only one element, or it is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements if they are more than one, `minn` is either `inf` or a finite value that is less than or equal to the current value of `same`, and `num` is the last unique number encountered in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ar` is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3], `i` is 7, `same` is 2, `num` is 3, `n` is unchanged. If `minn` is infinity, the condition `minn == inf` is true. Otherwise, `minn` is 2 and `minn` is not equal to infinity.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
