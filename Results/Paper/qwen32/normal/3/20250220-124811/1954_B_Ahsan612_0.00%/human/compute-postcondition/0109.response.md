Output State: **`ar` must have at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is either 4 or 5, `same` is either 1 or 3, `minn` is either 1 or `inf`, `num` is `ar[i]`, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given that `same` is either 1 or 3, and `minn` is either `inf` or 1, the new value of `minn` will be 1 if `same` is 1 or 3, and it will remain `inf` only if both `minn` and `same` were `inf` initially, which is not possible since `same` cannot be `inf`. Therefore, `minn` will be 1 after the execution of the code.
