The code `num = ar[i]` attempts to access the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. However, the initial state specifies that `i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`. This means that `i` is out of the bounds of the list `ar` since list indices in Python are zero-based and the maximum valid index is `len(ar) - 1`. Accessing an index out of bounds will result in an `IndexError`.

Given the precondition, the code will raise an `IndexError` and `num` will not be assigned a value. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged state of the variables and the error condition.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`, `len(ar)` must be `len(ar) + 1`, an `IndexError` is raised**.
