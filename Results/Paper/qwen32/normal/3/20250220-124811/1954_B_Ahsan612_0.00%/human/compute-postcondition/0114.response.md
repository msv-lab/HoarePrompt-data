The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given that `minn` is initially 2 and `same` is also 2, the result of `min(minn, same)` is 2. Therefore, `minn` remains 2.

The other variables (`ar`, `i`, `num`, `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`ar` is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3], `i` is 7, `same` is 2, `minn` is 2, `num` is 3, `n` is unchanged.**
