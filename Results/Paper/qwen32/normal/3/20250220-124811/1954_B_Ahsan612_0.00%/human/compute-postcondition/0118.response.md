Given the initial state:
- `ar` is the list `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]`
- `i` is the integer `7`
- `same` is the integer `2`
- `minn` is the integer `2`
- `num` is the integer `3`
- `n` is unchanged (but its value is not specified in the precondition, so it is irrelevant for this task)
- `minn` is not equal to infinity

The `print(minn)` statement will output the value of the variable `minn`.

From the initial state, we know that `minn` is explicitly given the value `2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(minn)` statement will be:
Output: **2**
