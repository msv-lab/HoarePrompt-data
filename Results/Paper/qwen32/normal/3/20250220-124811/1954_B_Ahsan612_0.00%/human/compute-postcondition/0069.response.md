The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the variable `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value and the value of `same`. The other variables (`i`, `ar`, `num`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `ar` has a length greater than `i`, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.**
