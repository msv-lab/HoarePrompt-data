Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. The provided program, however, calculates the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of identical elements and prints this value. This value does not necessarily indicate the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove such that we cannot apply the given operation to make all elements the same. This involves finding the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements and considering the possibility of breaking this subarray by removing elements. The program should calculate the longest subarray of identical elements and then determine the minimum removals needed to disrupt this subarray.

For example, in the fourth test case, the array is `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The longest subarray of identical elements is `[3, 3, 3]` (which appears twice). To make the array non-beautiful, we need to remove at least 3 elements (the first three 3's or the last three 3's). The provided program would instead find the shortest subarray of identical elements, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

Correctness: **False**
