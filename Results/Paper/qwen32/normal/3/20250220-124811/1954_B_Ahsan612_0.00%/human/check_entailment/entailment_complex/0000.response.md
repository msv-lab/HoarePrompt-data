### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. According to the problem definition, a beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The goal is to find the smallest contiguous subarray of identical elements, as removing all but one element from this subarray will make the array non-beautiful.

The logic in the program is as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
2. It initializes `same` to count the length of the current contiguous subarray with identical elements and `minn` to track the minimum length of such subarrays found so far.
3. It iterates through the array, updating `same` when consecutive elements are identical and resetting it when a different element is encountered.
4. After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time to ensure the last subarray is considered.
5. If `minn` remains `inf`, it means no contiguous subarray of identical elements was found, and the program outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs `minn`, which is the length of the smallest subarray of identical elements.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The program is designed to find the smallest contiguous subarray of identical elements, but it does not correctly handle cases where the array is already non-beautiful or where removing a single element could make it non-beautiful. For example, in the case of an array like `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program should return `1` because removing any single element (except the middle one) will make the array non-beautiful. But the program might not correctly identify this because it is looking for the smallest subarray of identical elements rather than the smallest number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

Given the example in the problem statement, the program does not correctly handle cases where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing a single element. For instance, in the case of `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program should return `1` because removing any single element (except the middle one) will make the array non-beautiful. However, the provided program does not correctly identify this scenario.
