The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `same` to 1. It does not modify the values of `n` or `ar`. Therefore, the values of `n` and `ar` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input value must be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer; `same` is 1.**
