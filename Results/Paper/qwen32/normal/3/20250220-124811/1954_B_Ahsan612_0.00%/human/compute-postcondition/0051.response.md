The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state specified that `i` is 1, so after the increment, `i` becomes 2. The conditions that `ar` must have a length greater than 1 and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` remain unchanged because the code does not affect `ar` or `num`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `ar` must have a length greater than 1, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**.
