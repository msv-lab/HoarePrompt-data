Output State: **The input value must be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is explicitly set to 1 in the code snippet, but since `same` was already 1 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged.
