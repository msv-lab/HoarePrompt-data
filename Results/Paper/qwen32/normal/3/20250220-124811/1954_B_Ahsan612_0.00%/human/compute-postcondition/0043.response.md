Output State: **The loop will continue until `i` is equal to the length of `ar`. `same` will hold the count of consecutive elements equal to `num` at the end of the last sequence of equal elements and is now 1. `minn` will hold the minimum count of consecutive equal elements encountered during the entire iteration, updated to be the minimum between its current value and `same` if `minn` was not initially `inf`. `num` will hold the last unique number encountered in the list. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it remains `inf`; otherwise, it is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements. `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` after the loop terminates. `n` is an input integer. `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

In simple terms: The variable `same` has been set to 1. All other variables retain their initial states and conditions.
