To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(minn)`, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `minn` is defined.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `i` is set to the length of the list `ar`. This indicates that the loop has completed iterating over all elements in `ar`.
- `same` is a variable that holds the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements in `ar`. If the last sequence consists of only one element, `same` will be 1; otherwise, it will be the count of the consecutive elements.
- `minn` is a variable that holds a finite value which is less than or equal to the current value of `same`. This suggests that `minn` keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive elements encountered in `ar`.
- `num` is the last unique number encountered in the list `ar`.

### Determining the Output:
The variable `minn` is described as a finite value that is less than or equal to the current value of `same`. Since `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements, and `minn` is the minimum count of such sequences encountered throughout the list, the value of `minn` will be the smallest count of consecutive elements found in `ar`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(minn)` statement will output the smallest count of consecutive elements found in the list `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the smallest count of consecutive elements found in the list `ar`)**
