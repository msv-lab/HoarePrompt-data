Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to find the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the entire strip to become white. The function `func_1` calculates the positions of the first and last 'B' in the string `s` and returns the length of the substring between these positions (inclusive) plus 2. However, this approach is incorrect. The correct approach should be to find the length of the longest continuous segment of 'B's in the string, as painting this segment will ensure that all black cells are painted white with the minimum length of the segment.

The provided function does not achieve this. Instead, it calculates the distance between the first and last 'B' and adds 2, which does not necessarily give the minimum segment length required to paint all 'B's white. For example, in the string "WBBWBW", the function will return 4 (distance between the first and last 'B' plus 2), but the correct answer is 4, which is the length of the longest continuous segment of 'B's ("BBWB" or "BWBW").

The function should be modified to find the longest continuous segment of 'B's and return its length.

Correctness: **False**
