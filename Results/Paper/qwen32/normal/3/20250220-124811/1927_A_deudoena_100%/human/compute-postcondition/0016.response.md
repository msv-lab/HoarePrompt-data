The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop, `j` iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string
- `ma` is 0
- `mi` is 3 if the second character `j` in the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0
- `m` is an input integer
- `c` is 3
- `d` is 0
- `l` is an empty list
- If the second character `j` in the string `s` is 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the second character in the string `s`. For the next iteration, `j` should be the third character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 3 if the second character `j` in the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0, `m` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third character in the string `s`**
