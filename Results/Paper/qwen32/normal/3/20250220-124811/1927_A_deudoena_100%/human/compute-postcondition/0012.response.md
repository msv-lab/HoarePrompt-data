The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Given that the initial value of `c` is 2, after the execution of the code, `c` will be 3. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 1 if the current character `j` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0; `m` is an input integer; `c` is 3; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list. `j` is the second character in the string `s`. If the current character `j` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
