The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the current character `j`. If there are more characters in the string `s` to be processed, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the last processed character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the next character in the string `s`.

Given that the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, and assuming the current character `j` was the `c`-th character in the string `s`, the next character to be processed would be the `(c+1)`-th character in the string `s`. Therefore, we need to increment `c` by 1 and set `j` to the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 1 if the current character `j` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0; `m` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list. `j` is the second character in the string `s`. If the current character `j` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
