Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, `m` is an input integer, `c` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, `d` is 3, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third last character of `s`. If `j` equals 'B', then `ma` is `n - 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ma` remains 0.**
