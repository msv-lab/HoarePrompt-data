The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is being iterated over the reversed string `s[::-1]`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `j` to the next character in the reversed string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string
- `ma` is `n - 2` if `j` equals 'B', otherwise `ma` remains 0
- `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`
- `m` is an input integer
- `c` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`
- `d` is 2
- `l` is an empty list
- `j` is the second last character of `s`. If `j` equals 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

Since `j` is the second last character of `s` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` should be the third last character of `s` in the reversed string.

Let's denote the string `s` as `s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `s[n-2]`. For the next iteration, `j` should be `s[n-3]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string, `ma` is `n - 2` if `j` equals 'B', otherwise `ma` remains 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, `m` is an input integer, `c` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, `d` is 2, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third last character of `s`**
