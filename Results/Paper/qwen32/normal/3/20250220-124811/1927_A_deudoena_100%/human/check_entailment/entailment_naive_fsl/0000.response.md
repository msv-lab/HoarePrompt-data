Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white for all cells to become white. The logic in the program is flawed as it only calculates the distance between the first and last black cell and adds 2 to it, which does not necessarily give the minimum segment length required to paint all cells white.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**
```
Input:
1
5
WBWBW
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
Explanation: The minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make all cells white is 3 (for example, painting the segment from the 2nd to the 4th cell).

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
4
```
Explanation: The program calculates the distance between the first and last black cell (which are at positions 2 and 4) and adds 2, resulting in 4. This is incorrect because a segment of length 3 is sufficient.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and the correctness is False.
