Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 3 if the second character `j` in the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0; `m` is an input integer; `c` is 3; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list. If the second character `j` in the string `s` is 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
