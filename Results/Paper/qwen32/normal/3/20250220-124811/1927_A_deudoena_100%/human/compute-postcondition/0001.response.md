`m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `ma`, `mi`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 0; `m` is an input integer.**
