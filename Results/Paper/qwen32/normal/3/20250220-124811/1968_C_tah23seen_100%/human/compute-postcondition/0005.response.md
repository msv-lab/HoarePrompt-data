The variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. Since `i` is currently `n - 3`, the loop will execute one more time if `n - 3 >= 0`, which means `n >= 3`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `n` is at least 3. Currently, `i` is `n - 3`, so for the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 4` (since `i` is decremented in each iteration).

Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to `n - 4` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \), `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where the first \( n-2 \) elements are `10`, the \( n-1 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2]`, and the last element is `10`, `i` is `n - 4`**
