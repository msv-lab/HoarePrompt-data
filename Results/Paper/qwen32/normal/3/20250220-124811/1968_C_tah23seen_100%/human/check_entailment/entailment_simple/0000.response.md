Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by constructing an array `a` based on the given array `x`. However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect. The logic inside `func_1` does not guarantee that the constructed array `a` will satisfy the conditions `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

The current implementation of `func_1` sets all elements of `ans` to `10^9` initially and then tries to adjust them by subtracting elements of `arr` from the next element in `ans`. This approach does not ensure that the modulo condition is met. Specifically, the line `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` does not guarantee that `ans[i] % ans[i-1]` will equal `arr[i]`.

A correct approach would be to set `a_1` to a sufficiently large number (e.g., `10^9`) and then set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i` for `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `(a_{i-1} + x_i) % a_{i-1} = x_i`.

For example, for the input `4 2 4 1`, a correct output could be `1000000000 1000000002 1000000006 1000000007` (where `1000000002 % 1000000000 = 2`, `1000000006 % 1000000002 = 4`, and `1000000007 % 1000000006 = 1`).

Given the incorrect logic in `func_1`, the program will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
