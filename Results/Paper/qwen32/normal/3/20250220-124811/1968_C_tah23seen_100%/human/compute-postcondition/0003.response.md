The code modifies the `ans` list by setting `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, `ans[i + 1]` refers to the second last element of `ans`, which is `10` (since all elements of `ans` are initially `10`). Therefore, `ans[i]` becomes `10 - arr[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \), `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where the first \( n-2 \) elements are `10`, the \( n-1 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2]`, and the last element is `10`, `i` is `n - 2`**.
