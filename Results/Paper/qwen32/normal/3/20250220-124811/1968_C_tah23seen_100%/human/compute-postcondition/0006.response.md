The code snippet modifies the value of `ans[i]` based on the values of `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 4`, so `ans[i]` is the third last element of the `ans` list. The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

The initial state specifies:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \).
- `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \).
- `ans` is a list of `n` integers where the first \( n-2 \) elements are `10`, the \( n-1 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2]`, and the last element is `10`.
- `i` is `n - 4`.

After the execution of the code snippet, `ans[i]` will be updated to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Since `ans[i + 1]` is the second last element of the `ans` list and `i + 1` is `n - 3`, `ans[i + 1]` is `10 - arr[n-2]`. Therefore, `ans[i]` becomes `(10 - arr[n-2]) - arr[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of `n` integers where the first \( n-2 \) elements are `10`, the \( n-3 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-4]`, the \( n-2 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2]`, and the last element is `10`; `i` is `n - 4`.**
