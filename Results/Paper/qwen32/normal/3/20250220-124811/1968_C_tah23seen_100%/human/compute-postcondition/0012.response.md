Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of `n` integers where `ans[0] = 10 - (arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[n-2])`, `ans[1] = 10 - (arr[1] + ... + arr[n-2])`, ..., `ans[n-2] = 10 - arr[n-2]`, and `ans[n-1] = 10`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list `ans` where each element is calculated based on the sum of subsequent elements in the list `arr`, with the last element of `ans` always being 10.
