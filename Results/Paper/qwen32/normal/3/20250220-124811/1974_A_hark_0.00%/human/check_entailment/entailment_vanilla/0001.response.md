Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. Each screen can hold a maximum of 15 1x1 icons or a combination of 1x1 and 2x2 icons that do not exceed the 5x3 grid.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       return a if a < b else b
   ```
   This function returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. It is not used anywhere in the program, so it is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the program.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   ```python
   def func_2():
       (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
       if x > 0 and y > 0:
           bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
           x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
           bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
           print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
       elif x == 0 and y > 0:
           print(math.ceil(y / 2))
       elif x > 0 and y == 0:
           print(math.ceil(x / 15))
       else:
           print(0)
   ```
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the minimum number of screens required for `y` 2x2 icons, knowing that each screen can hold a maximum of 2 2x2 icons.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line is incorrect. It tries to adjust the number of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons, but the calculation is flawed. It incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` (which is not the correct number of 1x1 slots taken by `bxsfory` 2x2 icons) and adds `y * 4` (which is not a relevant adjustment).
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This attempts to calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, but the value of `x` has been incorrectly adjusted.
     - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This prints the total number of screens, which is incorrect due to the errors in calculating `x` and `bxsfory1`.
   
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
     - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.
   
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
     - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `x` 1x1 icons.
   
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - `print(0)`: This correctly outputs 0 screens as no icons are needed.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   ```python
   def func_3():
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           func_2()
   ```
   This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_2` for each test case.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling cases where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. The calculation of the remaining 1x1 icons and the number of additional screens needed is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
