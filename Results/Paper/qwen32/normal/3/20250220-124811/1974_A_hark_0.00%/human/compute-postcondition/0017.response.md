It seems there's a discrepancy between the provided function definition and the parameter constraints. The function `func_2` is defined without any parameters, but the constraints mention `x` and `y` as non-negative integers. To adhere to the provided constraints, the function should accept `x` and `y` as parameters.

Assuming the function definition should be:
```
def func_2(x, y):
```
Here is the functionality description:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99. The function returns the sum of `x` and `y`.**
