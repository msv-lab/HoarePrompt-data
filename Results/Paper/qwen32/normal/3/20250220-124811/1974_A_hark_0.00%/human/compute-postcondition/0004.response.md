To determine the output state, we need to consider the function `func_2()` and its impact on the variable `t` and any other variables it might affect. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine the exact changes it might make to the variables. However, we can describe the output state based on the possible outcomes if `func_2()` were to modify `t` or introduce new variables.

Given the lack of information about `func_2()`, we assume that `func_2()` could potentially modify `t` or introduce new variables. Since no specific changes are described, we can only conclude that `t` might have been altered by the function, and we cannot determine the exact new value of `t`.

If `func_2()` does not modify `t` or any other variables, then the output state would remain the same as the initial state.

Since we do not have more details about `func_2()`, we will consider the most general case where `t` could have been changed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, and `t` may have been modified by `func_2()`**.
