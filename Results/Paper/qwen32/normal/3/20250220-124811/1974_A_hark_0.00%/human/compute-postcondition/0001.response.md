The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable in Python and is not used within the loop, the only state we need to adjust is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. Given the constraint `1 <= t <= 10^4`, the initial state already satisfies this condition. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

However, to adhere to the format and explicitly state the conditions:

State: **`t` is an input integer, such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
