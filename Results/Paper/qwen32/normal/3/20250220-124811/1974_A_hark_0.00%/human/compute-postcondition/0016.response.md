Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, `y` remains unchanged, `bxsfory` is set to `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` is `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. If either `x` or `y` (or both) is 0, `x` and `y` retain their original values.**
