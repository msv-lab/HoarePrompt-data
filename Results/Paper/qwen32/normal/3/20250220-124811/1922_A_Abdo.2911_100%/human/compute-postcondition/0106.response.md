Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `possible` is `True`. Additionally, the `i`-th character of `a` is not equal to the `i`-th character of `b`, and the `i`-th character of `c` is neither equal to the `i`-th character of `a` nor the `i`-th character of `b`. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables.
