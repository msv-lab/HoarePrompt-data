Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `i` is 3. If `c[3]` is not equal to `a[3]`, then `possible` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
