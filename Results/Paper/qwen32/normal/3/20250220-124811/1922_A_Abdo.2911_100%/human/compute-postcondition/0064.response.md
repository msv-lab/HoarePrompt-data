Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of if `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`.**
