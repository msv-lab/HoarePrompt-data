Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if there is any position `i` where the character in `c` does not match the character in either `a` or `b` if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, or if `c[i]` does not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]` if they are different. It prints 'YES' if such a position exists for any test case, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
