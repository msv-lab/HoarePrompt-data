Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `possible` is `False`. Additionally, the `i`-th character of `a` is not equal to the `i`-th character of `b`. The `i`-th character of `c` is equal to either the `i`-th character of `a` or the `i`-th character of `b`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables in this context. It simply passes control to the next iteration of a loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, it has no impact on the state of the variables. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
