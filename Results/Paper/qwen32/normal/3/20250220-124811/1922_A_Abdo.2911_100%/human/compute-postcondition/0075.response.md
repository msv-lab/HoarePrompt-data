The code snippet provided initializes a variable `possible` to `True`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`. The initial state of these variables remains unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `possible`, which is set to `True`.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `i` is `t + 1`, `possible` is `True`**.
