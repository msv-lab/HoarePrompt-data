Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `possible` is `True`. Additionally, the `i`th character of `a` is not equal to the `i`th character of `b`, and the `i`th character of `c` is not equal to the `i`th character of `a` and the `i`th character of `c` is not equal to the `i`th character of `b`.**

In simple terms, the value of `possible` has been changed to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.
