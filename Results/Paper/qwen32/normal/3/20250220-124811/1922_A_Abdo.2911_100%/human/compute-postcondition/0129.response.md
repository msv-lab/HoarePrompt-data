The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible`), but these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement in any way. The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the literal string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is set to 1.
2. The variable `n` is an integer value provided by the user.
3. The variable `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user.
4. The variable `b` is another string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user.
5. The variable `c` is a third string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user.
6. The variable `possible` is a boolean value set to `True`, indicating that at least one condition within a loop was met during some iteration.

Since the `print('YES')` statement does not reference any of these variables, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
