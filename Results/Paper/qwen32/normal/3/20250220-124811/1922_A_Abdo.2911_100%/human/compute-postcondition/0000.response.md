The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be the specific integer input provided, and it will still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
