Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and for the current index `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `possible` remains False. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
