The variable `possible` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` are not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1, `possible` is `True`.**
