Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `i` is `t + 1`, `possible` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `possible` remain unchanged. The code simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
