Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` for the same index `i` where `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`. The current value of `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` for some index `i`.**
