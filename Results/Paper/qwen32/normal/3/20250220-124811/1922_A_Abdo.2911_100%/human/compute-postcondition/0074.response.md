The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t`, and `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20).

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `t + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `i` is `t + 1`**
