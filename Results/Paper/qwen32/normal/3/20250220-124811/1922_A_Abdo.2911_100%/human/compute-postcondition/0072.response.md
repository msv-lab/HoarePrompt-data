Postcondition: **`t` is `t`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `i` is `t`. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the program continues to the next part. Otherwise, `possible` is `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
