The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, or `possible`. The only change is that the loop or if statement is terminated.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1, `possible` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
