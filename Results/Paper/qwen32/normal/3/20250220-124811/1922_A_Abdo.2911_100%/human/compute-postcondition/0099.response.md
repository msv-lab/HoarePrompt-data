Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `possible` is `True`. The current value of `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` for some index `i`, and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` for the same index `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables.
