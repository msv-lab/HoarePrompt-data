Output State: **`mak` is 4 if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `pans` is a list containing the value 4 if `s` is `'<'`, the value `i` if `s` is `'='`, or an empty list if `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, and now includes the value 5; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the new string input provided by the user; `i` is 5.**

In natural language: The value of `pans` has been updated to include the value 5. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
