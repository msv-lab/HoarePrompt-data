The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`), `mak` is `i_end` if the input string is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `n` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. So, if `i_end` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` should be `i_end + 1`. The value of `n` must be greater than this new value of `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`mak` is `i_end` if the input string is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` and `pans` remain their initial values, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_end`, we can represent the state in terms of the previous `i` value:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` and `pans` remain their initial values, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
