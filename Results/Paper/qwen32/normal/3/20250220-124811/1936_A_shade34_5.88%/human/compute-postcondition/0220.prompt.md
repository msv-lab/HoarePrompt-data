Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The sequence p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The interaction involves asking queries in the form "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and receiving a response of "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The goal is to find indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, mak)
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mak` is the largest index i for which the input was '>', `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where s was '=', and `n` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mak` is the last index `i` for which the input was `'>'`, or 0 if no `'>'` was ever input; `mak2` remains the initial value; `pans` remains the initial value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mak` is the last index `i` where the input was '>', or 0 if no '>' was received; `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received; `pans` contains all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and the last index `i` for which the input was '<' if such an input was received; `n` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
