Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations prior to this; `pans` is an empty list; `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is the string input provided by the user and its current value is `'<'`.**

In natural language: The variable `mak` is now assigned the value of `i`. The other variables `mak2`, `pans`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
