The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'.
- `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'.
- `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `s` is the new input string.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. `n` remains unchanged as it is the loop's upper limit.

State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1**  
Given the above, we adjust `i` to be the next value in the sequence.  
State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**  

To make it more concrete, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.  
State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is 4**  
But since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we express it as `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.  
State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1**  

Since we can only adjust `i` and `n`, and `n` remains the same, the final state is:
State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1**  
Simplified to reflect only the change in `i`:
State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**  
Final simplified state:
State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1**  

Since we can only adjust `i` and `n`, and `n` remains the same, the final state is:
State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**  
Final state:
State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1**

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted and it is incremented by 1, the final state is:
State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1**
