Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `mak` is equal to the new value of `i`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `mak` has been assigned the value of the newly incremented `i`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
