Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. **mak** is set to the value of `i` if the input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains `0`.
2. **mak2** remains at its initial value (not relevant for this print statement).
3. **pans** is a list containing at least `i + 1` elements.
4. **i** is incremented by `1` (i.e., `i = i + 1`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **mak**:
   - If the input is `'>'`, `mak` is set to the value of `i` before it was incremented.
   - If the input is not `'>'`, `mak` remains `0`.

2. **i**:
   - `i` is incremented by `1` before the `print` statement is executed, so the value of `i` used in `pans[i]` is the new value of `i` after the increment.

3. **pans**:
   - `pans` is a list with at least `i + 1` elements before the increment of `i`.
   - After incrementing `i`, `pans` must have at least `i` elements to ensure `pans[i]` is valid.

### Output:
- The `print` statement will output:
  - `?` (a literal question mark)
  - `pans[mak]` (the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`)
  - `pans[mak]` (the same element as above, repeated)
  - `pans[i]` (the element at the new index `i` in the list `pans`)
  - `pans[i]` (the same element as above, repeated)

### Final Output Description:
- If the input is `'>'`, `mak` will be the old value of `i`, and `i` will be the new value of `i` after incrementing.
- If the input is not `'>'`, `mak` will be `0`, and `i` will be the new value of `i` after incrementing.

Since the exact values of `mak`, `i`, and the contents of `pans` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak is the value of i before increment if input is '>', otherwise 0, and i is the value of i after increment)**
