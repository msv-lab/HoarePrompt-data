The code `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 before this code snippet, so we reflect that in the description of the output state.

Output State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if the previous `s` was equal to '<', otherwise `pans` has the previous elements plus the new `i`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
