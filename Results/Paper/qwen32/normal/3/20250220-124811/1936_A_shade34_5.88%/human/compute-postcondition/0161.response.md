The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` do not affect the loop's continuation and thus remain unchanged.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again. Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Since `n` must be greater than `i + 1` for the loop to continue, `n` should still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`mak` is `i + 1` if the input string is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains `i`, `mak2` and `pans` remain their initial values, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i`**
