The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `mak` is determined by the input string and does not affect the loop condition, we do not need to adjust `mak` or `t`.

Let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same as long as it is greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the value of `i` if the current input is the string `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the value of `i` if the current input is the string `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
