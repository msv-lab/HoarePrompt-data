Let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement to determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `mak` is `i` if the current input is `<`, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was `=`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

For loop statement:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In the loop head, the only variable that can be adjusted is `i` because it is the loop variable. The range of the loop is from 1 to `n-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a certain value, and since the loop continues to execute, it means that `i` was less than `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

The values of `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `n` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Given that `i` was the loop variable and it needs to be incremented, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is `<`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was `=`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`.

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is `<`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was `=`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we do not have the specific value of `i` from the previous iteration, the most accurate way to represent the state is:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is `<`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was `=`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to match the format of the previous examples, we can write:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is `<`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was `=`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is the next value in the range(1, n)**. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1, we can say:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is `<`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was `=`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration `i` would be `x + 1`.

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is `<`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was `=`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we do not have the specific value of `i`, the most accurate general form is:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is `<`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was `=`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is `<`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was `=`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.
