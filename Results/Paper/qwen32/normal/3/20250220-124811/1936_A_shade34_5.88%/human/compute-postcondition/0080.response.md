The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `mak` after the assignment. However, we can state that `mak` now holds the value of `i`. The other variables (`mak2`, `pans`, `n`, and the current input) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was '=', `n` must be greater than 1, and the current input is '<'**.
