You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The sequence p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The interaction involves asking queries in the form "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and receiving a response of "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The goal is to find indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '<':
                mak = i
        
        mak2 = mak
        
        pans = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            s = str(input())
            if s == '<':
                mak = i
                pans = [i]
            elif s == '=':
                pans.append(i)
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(pans)):
            print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '>':
                mak = i
        
        print('!', mak2, mak)
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: `mak` is the index in `pans` for which `p[i] ⊕ p[mak2]` is maximized, `mak2` is the index of the element in the permutation that has the maximum bitwise OR with all other elements, `pans` is a list of indices that have the same bitwise OR result with `mak2` as the maximum, and `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly. It interacts with an external system by asking queries in the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in a hidden permutation sequence. The function's goal is to determine and return indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized, using at most 3n queries per test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
