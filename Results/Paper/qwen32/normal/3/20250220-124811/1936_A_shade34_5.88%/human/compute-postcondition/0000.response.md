In the provided task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_`, which is the result of `int(input())`. This means the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` does not affect the state or the logic inside the loop, as it is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` to ensure that the loop can execute.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`, the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once and at most 1000 times. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself to ensure the loop executes.

However, to be thorough and in line with the task's requirement to specify the state, we can confirm that `t` is set to a value within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
