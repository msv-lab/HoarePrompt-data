The line `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the internal buffer of the standard output, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. However, this command does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the variables `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is the largest index i for which the input was '>', `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where s was '=', and `n` remains unchanged.**
