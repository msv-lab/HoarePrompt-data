The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is 4, `mak` is updated to 4. The other variables (`s`, `pans`, `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, `s` is the string input by the user, `mak` is 4, `pans` is `[i]` if `s` was initially '<', `pans` includes the value of `i` at the end of its current contents if `s` was initially '=', otherwise no changes are made to `pans`, `i` is 4, `n` remains unchanged.**
