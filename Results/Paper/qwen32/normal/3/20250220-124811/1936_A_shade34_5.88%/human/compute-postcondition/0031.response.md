The code snippet provided is `pans.append(i)`. This line appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `sys.stdout.flush()`, `s`, and the condition `s` not equal to '<' and equal to '=' are not affected by this line of code. The only change is that the list `pans` will now include the value of `i` at the end of its current contents.

Output State: **`sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, flushing the output buffer; `s` is the string input by the user, `s` is not equal to '<', and `s` is equal to '='; `pans` now includes the value of `i` at the end of its current contents.**
