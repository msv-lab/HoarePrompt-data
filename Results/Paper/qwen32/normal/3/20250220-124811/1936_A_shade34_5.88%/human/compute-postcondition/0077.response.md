Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is 0
- `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was '=' (Note: `s` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact contents of `pans`, but it is not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be greater than 1 (Note: `n` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value from the given information.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.
- Since `mak` is explicitly given as 0, the first two values after the `'?'` will be `0` and `0`.
- The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will include `i` twice, but we cannot specify its numerical value.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of the variable i that is not defined in the initial state)**
