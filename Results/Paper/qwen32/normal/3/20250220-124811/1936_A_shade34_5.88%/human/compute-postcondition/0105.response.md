The code snippet `pans.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given the initial state, `pans` is initially an empty list. After executing the code, `pans` will contain the value of `i` as its first (and currently only) element. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is a list containing the value `i`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string, `s` is equal to '='**.
