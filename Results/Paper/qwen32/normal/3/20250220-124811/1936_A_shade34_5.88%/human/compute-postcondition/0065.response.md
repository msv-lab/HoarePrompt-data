The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it iterates over, which is dependent on `pans`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pans`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(pans) - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `len(pans) - 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `mak` and `mak2` do not influence the loop continuation, and `n` remains unchanged. The only variables that need adjustment are `i` and the implicit dependency on `pans`.

State: **`mak` is `len(pans) - 2` if the input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was '=' and must have at least 2 elements, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`**
