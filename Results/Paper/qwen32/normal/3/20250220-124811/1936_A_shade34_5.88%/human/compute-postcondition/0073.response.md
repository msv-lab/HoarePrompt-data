The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't intend to use. Since the loop runs for a fixed number of iterations determined by `int(input())`, the state of `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `n` does not affect the loop's execution directly. However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time based on the iteration count.

Given that the loop runs for `int(input())` iterations, the loop will execute one more time as long as the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is not yet reached. The states `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `n` remain unchanged and do not need adjustment for the loop to continue.

State: **`mak` is the largest index i for which the input was '>', `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where s was '=', `n` remains unchanged**
