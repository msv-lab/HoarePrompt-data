The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the output device. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, none of the variables `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, or `n` are modified by the `sys.stdout.flush()` command. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was '=', `n` must be greater than 1**.
