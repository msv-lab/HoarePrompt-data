The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is the last index `i` for which the input was `'>'`, or 0 if no `'>'` was ever input; `mak2` remains the initial value; `pans` remains the initial value.**
