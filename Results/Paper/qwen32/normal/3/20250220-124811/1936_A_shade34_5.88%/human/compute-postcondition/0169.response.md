The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `pans` is an empty list; `n` must be greater than 0**
