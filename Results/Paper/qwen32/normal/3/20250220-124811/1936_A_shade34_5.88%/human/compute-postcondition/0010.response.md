Let's break down the problem step by step based on the provided initial state:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This represents the number of test cases or iterations.
   - `n` is greater than 1. This variable is mentioned but not directly used in the `print` statement, so its exact value doesn't affect the output for this specific print statement.
   - `mak` is set to the value of `i` if the current input is the string `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value with each iteration.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`. This means the output will be the string `'?'` followed by the value of `mak` twice, and the value of `i` twice.

3. **Determining Values:**
   - The value of `mak` depends on the input string. If the input string is `'<'`, `mak` will be set to the current value of `i` before it is incremented. If the input string is anything else, `mak` will remain 0.
   - The value of `i` is incremented by 1 with each iteration, so it starts from 0 (assuming it is initialized to 0 before the loop starts) and increases by 1 for each iteration.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1:** If the input string is `'<'`:
     - Suppose `i` is currently 3.
     - `mak` will be set to 3 (current value of `i`).
     - `i` will then be incremented to 4.
     - The print statement will output: `'? 3 3 4 4'`.
   - **Scenario 2:** If the input string is anything other than `'<'`:
     - Suppose `i` is currently 3.
     - `mak` will remain 0.
     - `i` will then be incremented to 4.
     - The print statement will output: `'? 0 0 4 4'`.

Since we don't have the exact input string, we can't determine the exact value of `mak`. However, we can describe the output based on the possible scenarios.

**Output:**
Output: **'? [mak] [mak] [i] [i]' (where [mak] is the value of mak which is the value of i if the input is '<', otherwise 0, and [i] is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1)**
