The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. The initial state specifies that `mak` and `mak2` are both 0, and `pans` is a list of indices where `s` was '=' with at least 2 elements. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the input provided is `'>'`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so the output state will reflect `mak` being assigned the value of `i` without changing the other variables.

Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was '=' and must have at least 2 elements, `n` remains unchanged, and the input provided is `'>'`.**
