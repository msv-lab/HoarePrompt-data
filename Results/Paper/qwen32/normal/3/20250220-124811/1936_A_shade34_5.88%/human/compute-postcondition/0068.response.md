Output State: **`mak` is `len(pans) - 1`; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was '=' and must have at least 2 elements; `n` remains unchanged; `i` is `len(pans) - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `mak` is updated to the value of `i`, which is `len(pans) - 1`. The values of `mak2`, `pans`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
