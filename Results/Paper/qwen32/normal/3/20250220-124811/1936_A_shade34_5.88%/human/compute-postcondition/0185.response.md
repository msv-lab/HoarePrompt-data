Output State: **`mak` is 4, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the new string input provided by the user; `i` is 4.**

In simple terms, the value of `mak` has been updated to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
