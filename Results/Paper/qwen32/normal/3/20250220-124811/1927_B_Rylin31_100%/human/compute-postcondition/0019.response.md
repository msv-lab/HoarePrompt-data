The given code snippet updates the `array` variable by reading a new list of integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `s`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is the new input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements set to 0; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `ans` is a string formed by concatenating characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in the previous `array`; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
