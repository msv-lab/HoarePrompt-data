The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list called `array`. The variables `t` and `l` remain unchanged, and `s` is still a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
