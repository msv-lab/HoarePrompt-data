To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `j` and the list `array`.

Given the for loop:
```python
for j in array:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `array` has at least one element. The variable `j` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it will be assigned the first element of `array` during the first iteration.

Here are the states we need to adjust:
- `array` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

The other variables (`t`, `l`, `s`, `ans`, and `i`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is the new input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements set to 0; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**
