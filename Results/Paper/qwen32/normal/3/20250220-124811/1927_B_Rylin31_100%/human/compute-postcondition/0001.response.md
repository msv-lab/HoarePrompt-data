The variable `l` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is an input integer**.
