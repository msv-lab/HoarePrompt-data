The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range generated by `int(input())`. Since the range is determined by the input and does not change during the loop iterations, we only need to adjust the variable `i` for the next iteration.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increase its value by 1 for the next iteration to continue the loop.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is some value, let's call it `x`, and the input value (which determines the range) is some value `n`.

State: **`i` is `x + 1`, the input value `n` remains the same**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `x` or `n`, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, the input value `n` remains the same**. 

However, to be more precise, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `x`, then:

State: **`i` is `x + 1`**.
