The code snippet `s[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` of the list `s` by 1. Given that `s` is a list of `l` zeros, after this operation, the element at index `j` will be 1, and all other elements will remain 0. The values of `i`, `l`, `array`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 1, `array` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is `'a'`**.
