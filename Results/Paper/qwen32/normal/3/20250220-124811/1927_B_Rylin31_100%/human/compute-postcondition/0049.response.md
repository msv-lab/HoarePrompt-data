Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters for each test case. The string `s` is constructed based on the values in the list `a` such that the sum of the indices of the characters in `s` (considering 'a' as 0, 'b' as 1, ..., 'z' as 25) matches the values in `a`.**
