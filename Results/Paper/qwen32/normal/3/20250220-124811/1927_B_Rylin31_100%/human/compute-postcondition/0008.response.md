The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is the loop variable iterating over `array`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` and ensure that `array` has elements left for `j` to iterate over.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l` is an input integer.
- `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 1.
- `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element.
- `ans` is a string with the value 'a'.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has taken the value of the last element in `array` that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be set to the next element in `array` if it exists.

Since the loop variable `j` takes the value of each element in `array` one by one, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the next element in `array` that has not been processed yet.

Let's denote the current value of `j` as `array[k]` where `k` is the index of the last processed element. For the next iteration, `j` should be `array[k+1]` provided `k+1` is a valid index in `array`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 1; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `ans` is a string with the value 'a'; `j` is the next element in `array` that has not been processed yet**.

Since we don't know the exact index `k` of the last processed element, we can generally say that `j` should be set to the next element in `array` if it exists. If `j` was the last element in the previous iteration, then the loop would not execute again, so we need to ensure there is a next element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 1; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have more than one element; `ans` is a string with the value 'a'; `j` is the next element in `array`**.
