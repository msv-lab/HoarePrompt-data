Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `j` is 1; `done` is True; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, and `done` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
