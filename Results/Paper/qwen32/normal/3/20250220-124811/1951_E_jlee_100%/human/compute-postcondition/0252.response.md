Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 1; `i` is 0; `done` is True if `count2 > count`, and otherwise `done` remains unchanged. If `count2 > count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
