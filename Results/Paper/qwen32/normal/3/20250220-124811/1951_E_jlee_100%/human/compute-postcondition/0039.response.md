Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input and must have at least 1 character; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0; `done` is `True`; `x` is the first character of `string`; If the count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, then every character in `s` is `x`. Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` in `s` is `x`. `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `j` is 0; `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the variable `done` is set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
