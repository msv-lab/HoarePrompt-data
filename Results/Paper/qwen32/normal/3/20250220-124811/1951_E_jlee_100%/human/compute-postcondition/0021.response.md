Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `done` is `False`; `x` is the first character of `string`; the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`; the current count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n - 1`.**
