The `print(1)` statement will output the integer value `1`. The variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `j` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of these variables and simply outputs the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
