Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `string` is the value of the input.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string` and `n` is odd.
- `done` is `False`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- The count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`.
- The current count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n - 1`.
- The character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` of `s` is not `x`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`, and the count of `x` in `s`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **NO**
