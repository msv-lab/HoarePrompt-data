Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input and has at least 1 character; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string` and is greater than 0; `x` is the first character of `string`; If the count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, then every character in `s` is `x`. Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` in `s` is `x`. `j` is 2. If `s[j] != x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. If `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`. If `s[j] != x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `s[j] != x` and `count2 < count`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j] != x` and `count2 == count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j] != x` and `count2 == count` and `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is set to 0. If `s[j] != x` and `count2 > count`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` retains its previous value.**
