The initial state provides various variables and their conditions but does not affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `j`, `i`) because it is a direct print of the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the code is:

Output: **YES**
