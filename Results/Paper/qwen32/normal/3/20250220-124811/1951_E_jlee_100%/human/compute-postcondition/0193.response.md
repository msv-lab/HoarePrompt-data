The `print('YES')` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `j`, and `i`.

Here's a breakdown of the given initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `string` is the value of the input.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `count2` is less than `count`.
- `j` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- The character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print('YES')` statement directly outputs the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
