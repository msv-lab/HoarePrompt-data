The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate at least one value (0) if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts; it will be initialized by the `range` function. The variable `s` is mentioned in the problem description but is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted here.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since the problem states that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, this condition is already satisfied by the problem constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
