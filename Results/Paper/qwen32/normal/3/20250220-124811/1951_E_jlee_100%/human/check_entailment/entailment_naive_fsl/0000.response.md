Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where the string can be partitioned into more than two parts, and where the string contains repeating characters in a way that prevents a simple two-part partition from being a valid solution.

Let's consider a few edge cases:

1. **Case with repeating characters but possible partition:**
   - Input: `aaabaa`
   - Expected Output: `YES\n3\naaa b a`
   - The program will output `NO` because it does not attempt to partition the string into more than two parts if it cannot find a suitable two-part partition.

2. **Case with a single character repeated multiple times:**
   - Input: `aaaa`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - The program correctly outputs `NO` for this case, but it does not generalize well to other cases.

3. **Case with a single non-matching character in the middle:**
   - Input: `aba`
   - Expected Output: `YES\n3\na b a`
   - The program outputs `NO` because it does not attempt to partition the string into more than two parts.

4. **Case where the string can be partitioned into more than two parts:**
   - Input: `abacaba`
   - Expected Output: `YES\n3\naba c aba`
   - The program outputs `NO` because it does not attempt to partition the string into more than two parts.

The program needs to be modified to handle these cases by attempting to partition the string into more than two parts if necessary. The current implementation is too restrictive and does not cover all possible valid partitions.

Here is a corrected version of the program that handles these cases:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        parts = []
        start = 0
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if not is_palindrome(string[start:j]):
                parts.append(string[start:j])
                start = j
        if start < n:
            parts.append(string[start:])
        if len(parts) > 1 and all(not is_palindrome(part) for part in parts):
            print('YES')
            print(len(parts))
            print(' '.join(parts))
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version attempts to partition the string into the smallest number of non-palindromic substrings and checks if all parts are non-palindromic. If it finds a valid partition, it prints the result; otherwise, it prints `NO`.
