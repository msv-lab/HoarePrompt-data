The code snippet provided sets the variable `done` to `True`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `i`, `count`, `count2`, and `done` (before this line) are all carried forward except for `done`, which is now `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 2; `i` is 0; `done` is True.**
