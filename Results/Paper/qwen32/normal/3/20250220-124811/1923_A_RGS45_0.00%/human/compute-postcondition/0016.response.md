The code snippet provided is:
```
n = int(input(''))
```
This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` < 1000
- `n` is the new input integer
- `arr` is the new string input provided by the user
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found
- `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found
- `z` is `arr[x:n - y]` if `x` is not -1, otherwise `z` is an empty string.

The variable `n` will be updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` < 1000, `n` is the new input integer provided by the user, `arr` is the new string input provided by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is `arr[x:n - y]` if `x` is not -1, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**
