### Reasoning:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last occurrence of a chip (1) in each test case. However, this approach does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Finding the First and Last '1':**
   - `x = arr.find('1')` correctly finds the index of the first '1' in the string.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first '1' in the reversed string. This is actually the index of the last '1' in the original string, but it needs to be adjusted to the correct position in the original string, which would be `n - 1 - y`.

2. **Calculating the Substring:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` is intended to get the substring from the first '1' to the last '1'. However, due to the incorrect calculation of `y`, this substring is not correctly defined.

3. **Counting '0's:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of '0's in the substring `z`. This count is supposed to represent the minimum number of operations needed, but because `z` is not correctly defined, the count is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the indices of all '1's in the string.
2. Calculate the total number of '0's between these '1's.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = input('').strip()
        
        # Find all indices of '1'
        indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(arr) if x == '1']
        
        # Calculate the number of '0's between these '1's
        operations = 0
        for i in range(1, len(indices)):
            operations += indices[i] - indices[i-1] - 1
        
        print(operations)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:

The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
