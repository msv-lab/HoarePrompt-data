Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations needed to gather all chips into a single block. Here's why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The input parsing is incorrect. The program reads the second line of each test case as a string without converting it into a list of integers. This is not a critical issue for the logic but it can lead to confusion later.

2. **Finding the Range of Chips**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first '1' (chip) in the array.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first '1' from the end of the array, which corresponds to the last '1' in the original array.

3. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` slices the array from the first '1' to the position just before the last '1' (from the end). However, `n - y` is not the correct index to slice up to because `y` is the position from the end, so the correct slicing should be `arr[x:n - y]` where `n - y` is replaced by `n - y - 1` or `len(arr) - y`.

4. **Counting Operations**:
   - The program counts the number of '0's in the sliced array `z` and prints it as the number of operations. While this approach seems reasonable, the slicing and counting logic is flawed due to the incorrect index calculation.

The correct approach should involve finding the range of chips and counting the number of free cells within that range. However, the provided code does not correctly handle the slicing, and it does not account for the correct range of cells that need to be considered.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = arr.index(1)  # First chip
        y = len(arr) - 1 - arr[::-1].index(1)  # Last chip
        # Count free cells between the first and last chip
        operations = arr[x:y+1].count(0)
        print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected version properly identifies the range of cells containing chips and counts the number of free cells within that range, which gives the correct number of operations needed.
