Let's analyze the given program step by step and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to move chips in a ribbon (an array of cells) such that all chips form a contiguous block with no free cells between them. The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
1. Reads the number of cells `n`.
2. Reads the string `arr` representing the ribbon.
3. Finds the first occurrence of '1' (chip) from the left (`x`).
4. Finds the first occurrence of '1' from the right (`y`).
5. Extracts the substring `z` from the first chip to the last chip (inclusive).
6. Counts the number of '0's in this substring `z` and prints it.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Substring Extraction**: The substring `z` is extracted from `x` to `n - y`, which is incorrect. The correct way to extract the substring from the first chip to the last chip is from `x` to `n - y - 1` (or `len(arr) - y - 1`).
2. **Logic Flaw**: The program assumes that the minimum number of operations is simply the count of '0's between the first and last chip. However, this is not always true. The correct approach involves calculating the number of operations required to move each chip to the leftmost possible free cell in the contiguous block.

### Correct Approach
The correct approach to solve this problem is:
1. Identify the positions of all chips.
2. Calculate the total number of operations required to move all chips to form a contiguous block. This can be done by calculating the distance each chip needs to move to reach its position in the contiguous block.

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a contiguous block.

**Correctness: False**
