The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the variable `t`. The value of `t` determines how many times the loop will execute. Since the problem states that `1 <= t <= 1000`, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop can execute at least once, as long as `t` is within the given range.

The other variables (`n`, the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and the fact that at least one `a_i` is 1) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000**
