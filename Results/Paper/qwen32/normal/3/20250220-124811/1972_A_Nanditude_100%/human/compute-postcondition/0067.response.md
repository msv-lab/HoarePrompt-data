To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it's mentioned for completeness).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a newly input list of integers.
- `b` is a newly input list of integers.
- `j` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `i` is the number of times `b[j]` was not less than `a[i]` during the loop.
- `cnt` is the number of times `b[j]` was less than `a[i]` during the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cnt)
```

### Analysis:
The variable `cnt` is described as the number of times `b[j]` was less than `a[i]` during the loop. However, the loop itself is not provided in the code snippet. Since we don't have the loop, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `cnt`. But we can describe its value based on the given information.

### Output Description:
The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`, which is the number of times `b[j]` was less than `a[i]` during the loop. Since the loop is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `cnt`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the number of times `b[j]` was less than `a[i]` during the loop)**
