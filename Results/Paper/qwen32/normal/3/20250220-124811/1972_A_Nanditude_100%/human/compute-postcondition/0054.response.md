Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a newly input list of integers, `b` is a newly input list of integers, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 1, and `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
