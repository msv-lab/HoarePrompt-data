Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1.**

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The conditions for `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `j`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
