Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers, `b` is the newly input list of integers, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, and `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` changes from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
