Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers, `b` is the newly input list of integers. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `i` is 1 and `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `cnt` is 0, `j` is 1**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
