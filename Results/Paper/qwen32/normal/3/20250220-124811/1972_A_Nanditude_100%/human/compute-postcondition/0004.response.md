The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` is still a list of integers obtained from the input.

Given the initial state and the code's impact, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input.**
