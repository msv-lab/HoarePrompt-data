The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `i` was initially 0, so it becomes 1. Otherwise, if `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, `i` was initially 2, so it becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers, `b` is the newly input list of integers, `j` is 2. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `i` is 1 and `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 3 and `cnt` is 0.**
