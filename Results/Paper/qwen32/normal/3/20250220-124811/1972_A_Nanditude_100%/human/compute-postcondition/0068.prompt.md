Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n`, `a`, and `b` are still as described in the initial state for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `i` is the number of elements in `b` that are not less than the corresponding elements in `a`, and `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be the number of elements in `b`, `a` is the list of integers, `b` is the list of integers, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is the count of elements in `b` that are not less than the corresponding elements in `a`, `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the newly input list of integers, `b` is the newly input list of integers, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is the number of times `b[j]` was not less than `a[i]` during the loop, `cnt` is the number of times `b[j]` was less than `a[i]` during the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
