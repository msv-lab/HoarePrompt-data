The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `done`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, or `x`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'`.
- The variables `done`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, and `x` are mentioned in the initial state, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
