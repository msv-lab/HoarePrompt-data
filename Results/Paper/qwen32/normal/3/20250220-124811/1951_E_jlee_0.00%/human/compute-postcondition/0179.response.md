The provided initial state describes several variables and conditions but does not provide specific values for most of them. However, the `print` statement in question is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of the variables described in the initial state.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, `j`, or any other variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
