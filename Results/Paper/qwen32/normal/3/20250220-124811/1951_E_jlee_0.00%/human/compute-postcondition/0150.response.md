Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `done` is `False`; `count` and `count2` are integers based on the loop conditions; `j` is the loop variable iterating from 0 to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. The current value of `done` remains `False`.**
