Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`; `count` is greater than 0; `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count2` is greater than `count`. Otherwise, `done` remains `False`. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both the cases where `count2` is greater than `count` and where it is not.
