Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `count` is greater than 0; `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count`, `done` is `True` and if `count` is greater than 1, `count2` is equal to `count`. If `count` is equal to 1, `count2` is 0 and `done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains `False`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is `True`.**
