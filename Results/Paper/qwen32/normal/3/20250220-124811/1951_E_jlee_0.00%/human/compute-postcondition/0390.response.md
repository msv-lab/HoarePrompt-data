Postcondition: **`done` is True if `count2` is greater than `count`. Otherwise, `done` remains False. `j` is 0; `count` is 0 if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged; `count2` is 1 if the character at position `j` in `s` is equal to `x` and `count` is greater than 0, otherwise `count2` is either 0 (if `count` is 1) or equal to `count` (if `count` is greater than 1); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `s.count(x) == n` or `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the conditions remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `done` is set to True.**
