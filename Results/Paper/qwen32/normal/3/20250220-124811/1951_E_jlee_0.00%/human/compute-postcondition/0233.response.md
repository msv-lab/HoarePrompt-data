To determine what will be printed by the `print(string[:j], string[j:])` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the logic described.

### Initial State and Key Variables
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
- `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of the new `string`.
- `count` is set to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`.
- `done` is set to `True` if `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`.
- `count2` is incremented by 1 for each `s[j]` not equal to `x` if `count` is greater than 0.
- `done` is set to `True` if `count2` equals `count` (with additional conditions).
- `done` is set to `True` if `count2` is greater than `count`.
- `count2` is set to 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `x`.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Logic Analysis
The code is iterating through the string `string` using the index `j`. The logic involves checking conditions related to the characters in the string and updating variables `count`, `count2`, and `done` accordingly. The print statement is executed after these checks and updates.

### Output Determination
The print statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])` splits the string `string` at index `j` and prints the two resulting substrings:
- `string[:j]` represents the substring from the start of `string` up to, but not including, the character at index `j`.
- `string[j:]` represents the substring from the character at index `j` to the end of `string`.

Since the exact value of `j` is not explicitly given in the initial state but is described as being incremented in the loop, the value of `j` at the point of the print statement depends on the loop's iteration and the conditions specified.

Given the conditions and the fact that `j` is incremented in each iteration, the value of `j` will be the point at which the loop terminates or the print statement is called. Without the specific value of `j`, we can describe the output in terms of `j`.

### Final Output
Output: **string[:j], string[j:] (where j is the current index in the iteration when the print statement is executed)**

This output reflects the current state of the string split at the index `j` when the print statement is executed.
