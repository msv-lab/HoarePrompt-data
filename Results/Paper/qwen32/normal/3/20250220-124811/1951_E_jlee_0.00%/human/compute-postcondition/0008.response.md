The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, and `done` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand, `string` is an input string with a length of 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string` containing exactly one character, `n` is the length of `string` and equals 1, `done` is `False`.**
