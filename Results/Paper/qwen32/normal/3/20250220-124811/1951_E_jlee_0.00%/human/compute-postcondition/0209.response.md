Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` for some `j` in the range from 0 to \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\), otherwise `done` remains `False`; `count` is greater than 0, indicating that `s[j]` was not equal to `x` for some `j` before the loop was broken; `count2` is greater than `count`; `j` is the loop variable iterating from 0 to \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\) and the loop was broken when `count` became greater than 0; `s[j]` is not equal to `x`**
