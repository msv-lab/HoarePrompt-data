The code snippet reads an input string and assigns it to the variable `string`. The variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will include the newly assigned value to `string` while keeping the preconditions for `t` and `i` intact.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand, `string` is an input string.**
