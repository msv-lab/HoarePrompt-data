Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, then `count` is set to the value of `j`; `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In this output state, the value of `i` and `j` have each been incremented by 1 from their previous values. The variable `string` holds a new input string, `s` is the list of characters from this new string, and `n` is the length of this new string. The variable `x` holds the first character of this new string. The condition for `count` to be set to the value of `j` remains as specified, and `done` is set to `True`, causing the most internal loop or if statement to be broken out of.
