Let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`i`**: Incremented by 1 from its previous value (not explicitly used in the print statement).
3. **`string`**: A new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1.
4. **`s`**: A list of characters from the new `string`.
5. **`n`**: The length of the new `string` and must be at least 1.
6. **`x`**: The first character of the new `string`.
7. **`count`**: Initialized to 0 or set to the first index `j` where `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`.
8. **`count2`**: Incremented by 1 for each `s[j]` not equal to `x` if `count > 0`.
9. **`done`**: A boolean that gets set to `True` under certain conditions based on character comparisons.
10. **`j`**: Incremented by 1 from its previous value (not explicitly used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This statement is executed regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `done`, and `j`. The print statement does not depend on any of these variables or their values.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is always `'YES'`, regardless of the input conditions or the values of the variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
