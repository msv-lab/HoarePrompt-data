The code snippet assigns the length of the list `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, the length of `s` is equal to the length of `string`. Therefore, `n` will hold the value of the length of `string`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `string`.**
