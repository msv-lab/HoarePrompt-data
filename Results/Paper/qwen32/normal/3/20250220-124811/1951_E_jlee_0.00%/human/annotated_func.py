    #State: All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, a decision has been made and printed whether the string can be split into two non-empty parts such that the first part and the second part are not identical, or if no such split is possible.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a string `s`. For each string, it determines whether the string can be split into two non-empty parts such that the first part and the second part are not identical. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES', followed by the number of splits needed (either 1 or 2), and the split parts. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'.
