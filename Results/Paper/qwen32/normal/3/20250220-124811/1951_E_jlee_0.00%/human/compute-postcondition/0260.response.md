Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `done` is True; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables remain the same except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
