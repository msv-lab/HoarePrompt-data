Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`. If `count2` equals `count`, then `done` is `True` if `count > 1`, and `count2` is 0 if `count > 1`. Otherwise, `done` remains `False` and `count` is `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If `count2` does not equal `count`, then `done` is `True` if `count2` is greater than `count`, otherwise `done` remains `False` and `count` is `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.**
