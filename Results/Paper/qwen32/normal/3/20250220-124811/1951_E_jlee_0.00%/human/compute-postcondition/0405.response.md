To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to understand the conditions and state variables given in the initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables:**
   - `s`: A list of characters from the user input string `string`.
   - `n`: Length of the string `s` (at least 1).
   - `x`: The first character of the string `s`.
   - `j`: Initialized to 1.
   - `count`: Initialized to 0. It is set to 1 if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`.
   - `count2`: Initialized to 0. It is set to 1 if `count > 1` and `s[j] == x`. Otherwise, it increments if `s[j] == x` and `count > 0`.
   - `done`: Initially False. It is set to True if `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]` or if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`.
   - `i`: Incremented by 1 from its previous value, but `i` is not used in the provided code snippet.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the conditions remain unchanged.
   - If `s.count(x) == n` or `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the conditions remain unchanged.
   - If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the conditions remain unchanged.
   - The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `done` is set to True.

### Analysis:
- The variable `done` is set to True if either `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]` or `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`.
- The `print('YES')` statement will execute if the program does not encounter a `break` due to `done` being set to True.
- Since `j` is initialized to 1, the comparison `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]` checks if the second character from the start is not equal to the second character from the end.
- The comparison `s[j] != x` checks if the second character is not equal to the first character.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will execute unless `done` is set to True during the checks described above. Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot definitively determine if `done` will be set to True or not. However, based on the given conditions and the structure of the problem, the print statement will output 'YES' if none of the conditions leading to `done` being True are met.

Output: **YES**
