Given the initial state, we have:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (though `t` is not directly used in the print statement).
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input.
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `y` is between 0 and 9 inclusive.
- The current value of `x` is less than `y`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(x, y)
```

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe them based on the given conditions.

The value of `x` is an integer greater than 0 and less than `y`.
The value of `y` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.

Therefore, the output will be the values of `x` and `y` as they are, given the constraints that `x` is less than `y`.

Output: **x, y (where x is an integer greater than 0 and less than y, and y is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive)**
