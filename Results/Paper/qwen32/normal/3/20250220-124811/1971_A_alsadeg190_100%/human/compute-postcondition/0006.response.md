Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.
- `x` is an integer greater than 0.
- `y` is an integer between 0 and 9, inclusive.
- `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(y, x)
```

This statement will print the values of `y` and `x` in that order, separated by a space. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe their values based on the given conditions.

Output: **y, x (where y is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, and x is an integer greater than 0 and x is greater than or equal to y)**
