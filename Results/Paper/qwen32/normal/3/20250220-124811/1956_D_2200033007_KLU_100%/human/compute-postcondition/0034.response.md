Functionality: **The function `make_stairs` accepts an integer `i` such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the length of the array `arr`. It also implicitly uses `start_index`, an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, and `res`, a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed. The function does not return anything (None) in all cases.**
