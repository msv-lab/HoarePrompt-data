Functionality: **The function `make_stairs` modifies the array `arr` starting from `start_index` such that the elements from `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` are set to `i` if they do not already form a "staircase" pattern (i.e., `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` from `0` to `i`). It appends tuples representing the operations performed to the list `res`. The function does not return any value.**
