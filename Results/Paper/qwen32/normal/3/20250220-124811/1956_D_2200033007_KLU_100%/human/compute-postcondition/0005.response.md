To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head, which includes the variable `j` and the range it iterates over, `range(i + 1)`. The variable `j` is the loop control variable, and `i` is a variable that influences the range of `j`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n
- `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n
- `arr` is a list of integers with n > 0
- `res` is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed
- `is_already_stairs` is a boolean value that depends on whether `arr[start_index + j]` equals `j` for all `j` in the range

The loop in question is:
```python
for j in range(i + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- The range `i + 1` remains the same, as `i` does not change within the loop.

Let's adjust the state:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value `k` (where `0 <= k <= i`).
- At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is incremented by 1, and all other variables (`i`, `start_index`, `arr`, `res`, `is_already_stairs`) remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers with n > 0, `res` is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed, `is_already_stairs` is a boolean value that depends on whether `arr[start_index + j]` equals `j` for all `j` in the range, `j` is incremented by 1**.

Since `j` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, and it is incremented by 1, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers with n > 0, `res` is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed, `is_already_stairs` is a boolean value that depends on whether `arr[start_index + j]` equals `j` for all `j` in the range, `j` is `j + 1`**.

To be more precise and in the given format:
State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers with n > 0, `res` is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed, `is_already_stairs` is a boolean value that depends on whether `arr[start_index + j]` equals `j` for all `j` in the range, `j` is incremented by 1**.

Since `j` is incremented by 1, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration `j` will be `k + 1`. If `j` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration `j` will be `i + 1`.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers with n > 0, `res` is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed, `is_already_stairs` is a boolean value that depends on whether `arr[start_index + j]` equals `j` for all `j` in the range, `j` is `i + 1`**.
