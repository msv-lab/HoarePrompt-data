Postcondition: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers with n > 0, `res` is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed, `is_already_stairs` is `True`. The current value of `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`.**
