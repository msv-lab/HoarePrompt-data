The code snippet `make_stairs(i - 1)` calls a function named `make_stairs` with the argument `i - 1`. This function call does not directly modify the variables `is_already_stairs`, `i`, or `arr[start_index + i]` in the provided initial state. The precondition about `is_already_stairs` and the values in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` remain valid. The only change is that the function `make_stairs` is invoked with the argument `i - 1`.

Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is `False`, meaning there exists at least one `j` from `0` to `i` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `0`. The current value of `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**
