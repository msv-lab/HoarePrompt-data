### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program to understand if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum for a given segment of the array `[start_index, end_index]` by considering all possible ways to partition the segment and applying the MEX operation.
   - It uses memoization (`res_dict`) to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The function handles three main cases:
     - If the segment has only one element, it returns the maximum of `1` and the value of that element.
     - If the segment can be transformed into a sequence of consecutive integers starting from `0` (which would result in the maximum sum `(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2`), it returns that value.
     - Otherwise, it considers all possible partitions of the segment and recursively calculates the maximum sum for each partition.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It handles the same three cases as `func_1`:
     - If the segment has only one element, it returns an empty list if the element is positive, or a list with a single operation if the element is zero.
     - If the segment can be transformed into a sequence of consecutive integers starting from `0`, it calls `make_stairs` to perform the necessary operations and returns the resulting list of operations.
     - Otherwise, it recursively constructs the operations for each partition that achieves the maximum sum.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function modifies the array to form a "staircase" pattern from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (i.e., `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` from `0` to `i`).
   - It checks if the segment is already in a staircase pattern. If not, it performs the necessary operations and updates the array accordingly.
   - It appends the operations performed to the result list `res`.

### Analysis:

- **Memoization**: The use of `res_dict` in `func_1` ensures that the function does not recompute results for the same segment multiple times, which is crucial for efficiency given the constraints.
- **Recursion and Partitioning**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` use recursion and partitioning to consider all possible ways to apply the MEX operation to achieve the maximum sum.
- **Constructing Operations**: `func_2` and `make_stairs` work together to construct the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum, ensuring that the operations are valid and within the allowed limit.

Given the detailed breakdown and the logic implemented, it appears that the program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum and constructs the sequence of operations to achieve it. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
