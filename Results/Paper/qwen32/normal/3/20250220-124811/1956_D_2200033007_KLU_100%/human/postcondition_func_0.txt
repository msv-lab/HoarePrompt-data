The function `func_1` calculates and returns the maximum value for a specific segment of the array `arr` defined by the indices `start_index` and `end_index`. It uses memoization with a dictionary `res_dict` to store and retrieve previously computed results for specific segments to optimize performance. The function handles three main cases: returning a cached result, computing the result for a single element segment, and computing the result for a multi-element segment by considering all possible partitions and their respective values.
