The code assigns the value of `i` to the element at the index `j` in the list `arr`. The values of `start_index`, `i`, and `j` are not specified beyond `i` not being equal to `0`. Therefore, the only change is that `arr[j]` now holds the value of `i`.

Output State: **`start_index` is a valid index, `i` is not equal to 0, `arr[j]` is equal to `i`.**
