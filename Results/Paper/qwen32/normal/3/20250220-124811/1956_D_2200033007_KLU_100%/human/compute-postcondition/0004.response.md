Postcondition: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers with n > 0, `res` is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed. If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.**
