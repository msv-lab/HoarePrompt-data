To determine what will be printed by the `print(x - y)` statement, we need to understand the values of `x` and `y` based on the given initial state.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- `l` is an integer such that `l` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `x` is the maximum value in `nums` from index 0 to `l-1`.
- `y` is the minimum value in `nums` from index 0 to `l-1`.
- `e` is `e + l`.

### Analysis:
1. **`nums` List**: This list is obtained from the input, and its exact values are not provided. However, we know it contains integers.
2. **`l` Value**: This integer specifies the range of indices in `nums` from which `x` and `y` are derived.
3. **`x` Value**: This is the maximum value in the sublist of `nums` from index 0 to `l-1`.
4. **`y` Value**: This is the minimum value in the sublist of `nums` from index 0 to `l-1`.

### Calculation of `x - y`:
- `x` is the maximum value in the sublist `nums[0:l]`.
- `y` is the minimum value in the sublist `nums[0:l]`.
- `x - y` will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in this sublist.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `nums` and `l` are not provided, we can only describe `x - y` in terms of the maximum and minimum values in the sublist `nums[0:l]`.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value and y is the minimum value in the sublist nums[0:l])**
