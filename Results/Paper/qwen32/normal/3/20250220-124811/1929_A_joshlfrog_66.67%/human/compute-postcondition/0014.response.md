The value of `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 1, `x` is `nums[1]`, and `y` is `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is less than `y`; otherwise, `y` remains 100000000.**
