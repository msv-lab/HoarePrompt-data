The value of `y` is updated to be equal to `nums[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `nums`, `x`, and `e`) remain unchanged. Since `nums[i]` is less than the previous value of `y` (which was 100000000), `y` now holds the value of `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `y` is `nums[i]`, `e` is `e + 1`, and `x` remains unchanged.**
