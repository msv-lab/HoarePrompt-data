Reasoning: The provided program attempts to construct a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` by calculating the MEX (minimum non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p`) and adjusting it according to the values in `a`. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly compute the permutation `p` as described in the problem statement.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program uses a variable `minn` to track the next smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`, but it does not correctly update this value or handle the case where `minn` is not the correct MEX. The MEX should be recalculated after each insertion of a new element into `mex`.

2. **Handling of Negative Values in `a`**: The program incorrectly calculates the value to append to `mex` when `a[i]` is negative. The correct approach would involve using the MEX of the current prefix and adjusting it based on `a[i]`, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

3. **Updating MEX Values**: The program does not maintain a set or a list to track which numbers have been used in `mex` to determine the correct MEX efficiently. Instead, it relies on `minn` and `maxx` which are not sufficient to correctly compute the MEX at each step.

To correctly solve the problem, a set should be used to keep track of the numbers that have been used in `mex` so far. For each `a[i]`, the MEX should be calculated by finding the smallest non-negative integer not in the set. Then, based on the value of `a[i]`, the correct value to append to `mex` should be determined and added to the set.

Given the issues described, the program does not correctly compute the permutation `p` for the given array `a`.

Correctness: **False**
