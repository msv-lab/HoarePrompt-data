You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

    #This is printed: (a blank line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes and prints a permutation `p` of `n` integers based on the values in `a`. Each integer in the permutation is derived from the values in `a` with specific rules involving non-negative integers and absolute differences. The function outputs the permutation for each test case, followed by a blank line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
Given an array `a` of length `n`, where each element `a_i` is defined by `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, the task is to reconstruct the permutation `p` of length `n` using the array `a`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over the array `a` and constructing the permutation `p` based on the value of `a_i`. The key steps are:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the permutation `p`.
   - `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0. `minn` is used to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation, while `maxx` is used to track the largest value in the constructed permutation.

2. **Iteration over `a`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in `a`:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` (the current smallest non-negative integer not yet used) and increments `minn`. If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, it increments `minn` further to ensure it is the smallest unused integer.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx` to this new value.

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the constructed permutation `mex`.

### Correctness Analysis
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

- **Incorrect Handling of `arr[i] <= 0`**: The program uses `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to determine the next element of the permutation when `arr[i] <= 0`. This approach does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not ensure that the permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- **Logic for `minn` and `maxx`**: The logic to increment `minn` and update `maxx` is flawed and does not correctly maintain the MEX property of the permutation.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain a set of unused integers and update it as we construct the permutation. Here is a sketch of the correct approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a set `unused` to keep track of all integers from 0 to `n-1` that are not yet used in the permutation.

2. **Iteration over `a`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in `a`:
     - Compute `mex_i`, which is the smallest unused integer in the set `unused`.
     - Set `p_i = mex_i - arr[i]`.
     - Remove `p_i` from the set `unused`.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the constructed permutation `p`.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to incorrect handling of the MEX property and logic for constructing the permutation.

**Correctness: False**
