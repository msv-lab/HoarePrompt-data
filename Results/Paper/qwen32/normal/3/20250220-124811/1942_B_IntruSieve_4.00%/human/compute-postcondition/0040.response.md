To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

**Initial State:**
- `mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be greater than 0.
- `minn` is the next smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`.
- `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`.

**Python Code Snippet:**
```python
print(itm, end=' ')
```

**Analysis:**
- The variable `itm` is not defined in the given initial state. This means that `itm` must have been defined somewhere in the code prior to this print statement.
- Since `itm` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, based on the context, we can infer that `itm` is likely to be one of the variables defined in the initial state, such as `minn`, `maxx`, or an element from the `mex` list.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that after printing `itm`, a space will be added instead of the default newline.

**Conclusion:**
Since `itm` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot provide its exact value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `itm`.

Output: **itm (where itm is a variable defined elsewhere in the code, likely to be minn, maxx, or an element from the mex list)**
