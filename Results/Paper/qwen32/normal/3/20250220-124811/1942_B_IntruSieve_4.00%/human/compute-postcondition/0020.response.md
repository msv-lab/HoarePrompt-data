Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index + 1; `mex` includes `minn` as its new last element; `minn` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `minn` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and constraints.
