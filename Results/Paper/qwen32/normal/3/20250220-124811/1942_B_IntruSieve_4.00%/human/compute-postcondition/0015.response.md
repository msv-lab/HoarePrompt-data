The code snippet `maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)` calculates the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and assigns it to `maxx`. Given that `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0 and `minn` is 0, the absolute difference simplifies to `-arr[i]` because `arr[i]` is non-positive. Therefore, `maxx` will be set to `-arr[i]`.

Since `mex` is a list containing the value `-arr[i]`, the value of `maxx` will be equal to the first (and only) element of `mex`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `mex` is a list containing the value `-arr[i]`; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is `-arr[i]`; `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0; the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`.**
