The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`.

Given the initial state, `arr` is not defined before the code execution. After the code execution, `arr` will hold the list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
