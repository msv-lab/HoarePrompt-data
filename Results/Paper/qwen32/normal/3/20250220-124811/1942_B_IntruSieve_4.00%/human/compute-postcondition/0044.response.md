The given code snippet is:

```python
print()
```

This `print()` statement does not contain any arguments. In Python, when `print()` is called without any arguments, it outputs a blank line.

Given the initial state, we have:
- `mex` is a list of `n` integers.
- `minn` is the next smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`.
- `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print()` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output will be a blank line.

Output: **(a blank line)**
