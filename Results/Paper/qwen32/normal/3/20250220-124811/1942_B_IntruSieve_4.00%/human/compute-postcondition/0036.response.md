To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` evolve with each iteration based on the input list `arr`.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex`: an empty list.
   - `minn`: 0.
   - `maxx`: 0.

2. **Loop Iteration Rules:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the list `arr`:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`:
       - Append `minn` to `mex`.
       - Increment `minn` by 1.
       - If `minn` equals `maxx`, then set `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`:
       - Append `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.
       - If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then update `maxx` to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the `mex` list will contain `n` elements, each determined by the rules above. The values of `minn` and `maxx` will be based on the final iteration of the loop.

- **`mex`**: This list will have `n` elements, where each element is either `minn` (if `arr[i] > 0`) or `abs(arr[i] - minn)` (if `arr[i] <= 0`).
- **`minn`**: This will be the smallest number not present in the `mex` list that hasn't been used yet, considering the rules for incrementing and resetting.
- **`maxx`**: This will be the maximum value encountered in the `mex` list during the loop.

### Conclusion:
The final state of `mex` will be a list of `n` elements, `minn` will be the next smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `mex`, and `maxx` will be the maximum value in `mex`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is the next smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`, and `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `mex` will have `n` elements derived from the input list `arr` following the given rules, `minn` will be the smallest non-negative integer not yet included in `mex`, and `maxx` will be the largest value in the `mex` list.
