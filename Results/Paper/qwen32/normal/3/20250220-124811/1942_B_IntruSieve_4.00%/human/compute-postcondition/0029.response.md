Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index; `mex` contains the previous elements of `mex` plus `minn`; `minn` is increased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `minn` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The `mex` list now includes the previous elements of `mex` plus the updated value of `minn`.
