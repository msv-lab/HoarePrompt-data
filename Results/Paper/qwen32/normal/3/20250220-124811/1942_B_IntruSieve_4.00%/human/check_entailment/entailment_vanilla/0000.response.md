Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a permutation `p` from the array `a` where each `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- The `MEX` of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- The program should output a valid permutation `p` for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the permutation `p`.
   - It uses two variables `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not in `p` and the maximum value in `p` respectively.

3. **Iterating through `a`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` again.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the constructed permutation `p`.

### Issues with the Program:
The program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Here are some critical points:

- **MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the `MEX` of the current prefix of `p`. It simply increments `minn` and uses it without checking if it's the actual `MEX`.
- **Handling Non-Positive `arr[i]`**: The program uses `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to determine the value to append to `mex` when `arr[i]` is non-positive. This does not guarantee that the value is the correct `MEX` minus `p_i`.
- **Updating `maxx`**: The use of `maxx` is not aligned with the problem's requirements and does not help in correctly constructing the permutation.

### Correct Approach:
- To correctly construct `p`, we need to maintain a list of available numbers (initially all numbers from `0` to `n-1`).
- For each element `arr[i]` in `a`, find the `MEX` of the current prefix of `p` and set `p[i]` to `MEX + arr[i]`.
- Remove `p[i]` from the list of available numbers.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the program's logic, it does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
