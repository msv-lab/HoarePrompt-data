The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop, `i` iterates from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current index + 1, which means it needs to be adjusted to the next index for the loop to execute again.

Given that `i` is the current index + 1, we need to decrement `i` by 1 to get the correct starting index for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index**
