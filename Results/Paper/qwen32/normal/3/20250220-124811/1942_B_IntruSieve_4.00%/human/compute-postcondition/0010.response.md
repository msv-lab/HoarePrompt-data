Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `mex` is a list containing the single element 0; `minn` is 1; `maxx` is 0; `arr[i]` is greater than 0; `minn` equals `maxx` + 1.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to be `maxx + 1`, which makes `minn` equal to 1 (since `maxx` is 0). All other variables remain unchanged.
