Functionality: **The function reads input describing a tree with exactly two leaves and a starting node. It determines the path between the two leaves and checks the distance of the starting node from each end of this path. Based on whether these distances are odd or even, it prints "Ron" if at least one distance is odd, otherwise it prints "Hermione".**
