Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; the next n-2 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` including `v` and now `nodes[v]` includes `u` and `nodes[u]` includes `v`; `i` is 2; `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input; `nodes[v]` now includes `u` and `nodes[u]` includes `v`.**

In natural language: The value of `nodes[u]` now includes `v`, and the value of `nodes[v]` includes `u`. All other variables remain unchanged.
