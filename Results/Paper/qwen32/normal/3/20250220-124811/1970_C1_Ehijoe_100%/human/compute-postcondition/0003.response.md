The code initializes a `defaultdict` of lists called `nodes`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges, the starting node `u_1`, the `edges` list, or the `empty` boolean.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists.**
