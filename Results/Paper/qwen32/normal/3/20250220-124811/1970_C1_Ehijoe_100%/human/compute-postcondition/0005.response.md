The code provided reads a pair of integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers representing edges of the tree, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists, and `i` is 0. The code does not modify any of these variables except for `u` and `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists; `i` is 0; `u` and `v` are integers read from the input.**
