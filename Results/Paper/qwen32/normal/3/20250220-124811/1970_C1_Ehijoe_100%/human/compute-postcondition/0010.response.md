The code snippet `nodes[u].append(v)` modifies the `nodes` defaultdict by appending the integer `v` to the list associated with the key `u`. This means that the adjacency list for node `u` now includes `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` including `v` and now `nodes[v]` includes `u`; `i` is 1; `u` and `v` are integers read from the input. `nodes[u]` now includes `v`.**

In simpler terms, the adjacency list for node `u` now includes `v`, while the rest of the state remains unchanged.
