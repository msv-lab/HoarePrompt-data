Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v; `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `ends` is a list containing all leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the elements `s` and `curr`, and now also includes `curr` appended to it; `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]` if `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, otherwise `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][0]`; `prev` is updated to the previous value of `curr`; `curr` must be different from `e`.**

This postcondition summarizes that after the if-else block, the variables retain their original constraints and values as described in the precondition, with the exception of `curr` and `prev`. If `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, then `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]`; otherwise, `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][0]`. In both cases, `prev` is updated to the previous value of `curr`, and `curr` must remain different from `e`.
