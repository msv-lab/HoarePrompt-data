The code snippet `nodes[v].append(u)` modifies the `nodes` dictionary by appending the value of `u` to the list associated with the key `v`. This means that the adjacency list for the node `v` now includes the node `u`.

Given the initial state, the `nodes` dictionary is a defaultdict of lists. The line of code adds `u` to the list of neighbors for `v`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; the next n-2 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` including `v` and now `nodes[v]` includes both `u` and `v`; `i` is 2; `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input.**
