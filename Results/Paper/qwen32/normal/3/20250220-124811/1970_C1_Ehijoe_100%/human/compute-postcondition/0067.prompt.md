You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.

At least one element in `moves` is odd if the if condition is true, otherwise all elements in `moves` are even numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `t` (which is always 1), a list of `n-1` pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of a tree, and a single integer `u_1` representing the starting node of the stone. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The function returns a value related to the tree structure and the starting node `u_1`.
