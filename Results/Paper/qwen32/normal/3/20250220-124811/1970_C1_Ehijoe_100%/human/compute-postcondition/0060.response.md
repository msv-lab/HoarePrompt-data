The code snippet assigns the value of `idx` to the first element of the list `moves` and the value of `n - idx - 1` to the second element of the list `moves`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `moves` is a new list that has been created and populated with the specified values. The values of `n`, `idx`, and `tree` are used to compute the values of the elements in `moves`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v; `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `ends` is a list containing all leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the path from `s` to `e` with `e` appended at the end; `prev` is the node just before `e` in the path; `curr` is `e`; `start` is an input integer; `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`; `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`.**
