Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input value; `k` is `max(0, initial_k - n)`; `i` is `n + 2`; `s` is the result of `p` list updates for `n` iterations; `b` is the result of `p` list updates for `n` iterations; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for `n` iterations; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for `n` iterations; `bm` is the maximum `a[b] * k + bp` encountered during the loop; `sm` is the maximum `a[s] * k + sp` encountered during the loop; `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`**
