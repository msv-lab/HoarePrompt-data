The code snippet `sp += a[s]` updates the value of `sp` by adding `a[s]` to it. Given that `sp` is initially `a[s]`, this operation effectively doubles the value of `sp` if `a[s]` remains unchanged, or adds the value of `a[s]` to its previous value.

Based on the initial state provided:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 3
- `s` is `p[previous_s] - 1`
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `sp` is `a[s]`
- `bp` is `a[b]`
- If `k` equals 0, then `bm` is `a[b]`. Otherwise, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`.
- `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`.

After executing `sp += a[s]`, the new value of `sp` will be `sp + a[s]`, which is `a[s] + a[s]` or `2 * a[s]` if `sp` was initially `a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 3; `s` is `p[previous_s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; If `k` equals 0, then `bm` is `a[b]`. Otherwise, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`. `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`.**
