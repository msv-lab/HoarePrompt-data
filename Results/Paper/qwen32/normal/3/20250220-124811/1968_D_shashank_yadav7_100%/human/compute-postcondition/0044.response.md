The `print('Bodya')` statement will output the string 'Bodya' directly, as it is specified in the print statement. The initial state provides several variable definitions and conditions, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string provided in the `print` statement.

Output: **Bodya**
