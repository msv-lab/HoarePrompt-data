The code snippet provided modifies the value of `bp` by adding `a[b]` to its current value. Here's the updated state of the variables after the code is executed:

- `t` is still greater than 0.
- `n` is still greater than 3.
- `k` is still -1.
- `i` is still 3.
- `s` is still `p[s] - 1`.
- `b` is still `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`.
- `p` is still the same new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is still the same new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `sp` is still `3 * a[s] - 1`.
- `bp` is now `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[b]`.
- `bm` is still `a[b]`.
- `sm` is still `max(0, sp, a[s] * k + sp)`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 3; `k` is -1; `i` is 3; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `3 * a[s] - 1`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b]`; `sm` is `max(0, sp, a[s] * k + sp)`**.
