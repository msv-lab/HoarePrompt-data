Postcondition: **`k` equals 0; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 3; `s` is the input value minus 1; `b` is the input value minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b] * (k - 1)` which simplifies to `a[b] * (-1)`; `sm` is `a[s] * (k - 1)` which simplifies to `a[s] * (-1)`**

In simpler terms: **`k` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `s` and `b` are both the input value minus 1, `a` and `p` are new lists of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is the element at index `s` in `a`, `bp` is the element at index `b` in `a`, `bm` is the element at index `b` in `a` multiplied by -1, and `sm` is the element at index `s` in `a` multiplied by -1.**
