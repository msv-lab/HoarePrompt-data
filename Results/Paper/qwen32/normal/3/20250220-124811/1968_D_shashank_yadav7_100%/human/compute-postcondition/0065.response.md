Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `i` is 2; `s` is the input value minus 1; `b` is the input value minus 1; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is 0; `sm` is 0; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
