The provided code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The other variables (`t`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input value; `k` is the input value; `i` is 3; `s` is the input value; `b` is the input value; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` over the number of iterations; `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` over the number of iterations; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over the iterations; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over the iterations. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**

In simpler terms, the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are updated with the values provided by the input, while all other variables retain their initial states.
