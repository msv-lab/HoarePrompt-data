The code snippet assigns the value of `a[s] * k` to `sm`. Given the initial state, `sm` is initially defined as the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over the iterations. However, after this line of code executes, `sm` is simply set to `a[s] * k`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input value; `k` is the input value; `i` is 3; `s` is the input value minus 1; `b` is the input value minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b] * k`; `sm` is `a[s] * k`.**
