Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 4; `k` is -2; `i` is 4; `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `3 * a[s] - 1`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `bm` is `max(a[b], a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `max(0, sp, a[s] * k + sp)`**

In this output state, the only variable that has been changed is `bm`. It is now the maximum of its previous value `a[b]` and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`. All other variables retain their initial values or calculated expressions.
