Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 3; `s` is the input value minus 1; `b` is the input value minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`. If `k` equals 0, then `bm` is `a[b] * (-1)` and `sm` is `a[s] * (-1)`. Otherwise, `bm` is `a[b] * (k - 1)` and `sm` is `a[s] * (k - 1)`.**
