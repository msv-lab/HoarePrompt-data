The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 5. The condition `n` being greater than 4 must still hold true for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 4; `i` is 5; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s] + a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[b] + a[b]`; `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`; `k` is decreased by 1. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
