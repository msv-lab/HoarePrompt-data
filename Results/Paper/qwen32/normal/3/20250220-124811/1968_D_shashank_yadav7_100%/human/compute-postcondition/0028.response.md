Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is -1, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is `max(max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sp * k, a[s] * k + sp)`**

In simple terms, the value of `bm` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
