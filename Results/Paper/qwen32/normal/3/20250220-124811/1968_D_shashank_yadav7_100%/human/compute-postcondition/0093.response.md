To determine the final state of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables `k`, `s`, `b`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` evolve over each iteration. The loop continues until `k` becomes 0. Given the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop, we can infer the final state after all iterations.

Let's break down the loop's behavior:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` starts at the input value `k`.
   - `s` starts at `input_value - 1`.
   - `b` starts at `input_value - 1`.
   - `sp` starts at `a[s]`.
   - `bp` starts at `a[b] * k`.
   - `bm` starts at `a[b] * k`.
   - `sm` starts at `a[s] * k`.

2. **Loop Iterations:**
   - Each iteration decrements `k` by 1.
   - The loop terminates when `k` reaches 0.
   - `s` and `b` are updated based on the values in `p`.
   - `sp` and `bp` accumulate the values from `a`.
   - `bm` and `sm` are updated to the maximum of their current values and the new computed values.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can see that the loop iterates until `k` becomes 0. Let's infer the final state:

- **When `k` reaches 0:**
  - `k` will be 0.
  - `i` will be `k + 2` which is 2 (since `k` starts at `k` and decrements until it reaches 0).
  - `s` and `b` will be updated based on the final values in `p`.
  - `sp` will be the cumulative sum of `a[s]` over the number of iterations.
  - `bp` will be the cumulative sum of `a[b]` over the number of iterations.
  - `bm` will be the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over the iterations.
  - `sm` will be the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over the iterations.

Let's calculate the final state:

- `k` will be 0.
- `i` will be 2 (since `k` starts at `k` and decrements until it reaches 0).
- `s` and `b` will be updated based on the final values in `p`.
- `sp` will be the cumulative sum of `a[s]` over the number of iterations.
- `bp` will be the cumulative sum of `a[b]` over the number of iterations.
- `bm` will be the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over the iterations.
- `sm` will be the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over the iterations.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final state will be:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input value; `k` is 0; `i` is 2; `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations; `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` over the number of iterations; `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` over the number of iterations; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over the iterations; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over the iterations.**

In simpler terms, the loop runs until `k` becomes 0, and at that point, `k` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` and `b` are updated based on the values in `p`, `sp` and `bp` are the cumulative sums of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, and `bm` and `sm` are the maximum values of the computed expressions over the iterations.
