The value of `sp` is incremented by `a[s]`. The previous value of `sp` is `2 * a[s] - 1`, so the new value of `sp` is `2 * a[s] - 1 + a[s]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[s] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 3; `k` is -1; `i` is 3; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `3 * a[s] - 1`; `bp` is `2 * a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b]`; `sm` is `max(0, sp, a[s] * k + sp)`**
