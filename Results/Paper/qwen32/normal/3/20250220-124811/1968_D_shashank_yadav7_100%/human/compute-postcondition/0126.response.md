Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 4; `i` is 4; `s` is `p[previous_s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[b]`; If `k` equals 0, then `bm` is `a[b]`. Otherwise, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`; `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`; `k` is decreased by 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `a`, `p`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged. The variable `k` is decreased by 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
