The code reads a line of input, splits it into four integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The initial state only specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and this condition is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the output state includes the new values assigned to `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`, while `t` remains unchanged with its initial condition.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the four integers obtained from the input.**
