The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is the input value minus 1; `i` is 3; `s` is the input value minus 1; `b` is the input value minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b] * k`; `sm` is `a[s] * k`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is the input value minus 1; `i` is 3; `s` is the input value minus 1; `b` is the input value minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b] * (k - 1)`; `sm` is `a[s] * (k - 1)`**.
