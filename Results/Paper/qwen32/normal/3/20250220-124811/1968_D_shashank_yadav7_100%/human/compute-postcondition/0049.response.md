The given initial state provides a context for variables and their relationships, but it does not directly influence the output of the `print('Draw')` statement. The `print('Draw')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'Draw' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Breakdown**:
   - `t` and `n` are both greater than 0.
   - `k` is initialized to 0.
   - `i` is set to `k + 1`, which means `i` is 1.
   - `s` and `b` are described as the final values after `k + 1` updates, but since `k` is 0, `s` and `b` are the initial values.
   - `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input.
   - `sp` and `bp` are cumulative sums of elements from list `a` at indices `s` and `b` respectively, over `k + 1` iterations.
   - `bm` and `sm` are described as the maximum values encountered during the iterations, and `bm` is equal to `sm`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('Draw')` statement directly outputs the string 'Draw' without referencing any of the variables described in the initial state.

Given the above, the output of the `print('Draw')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables.

Output: **Draw**
