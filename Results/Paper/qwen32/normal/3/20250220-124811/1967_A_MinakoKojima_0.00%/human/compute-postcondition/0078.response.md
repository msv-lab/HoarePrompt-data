The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration, `a` is the list after all updates, `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a` for all `i` up to the current value, `i` is 3**
