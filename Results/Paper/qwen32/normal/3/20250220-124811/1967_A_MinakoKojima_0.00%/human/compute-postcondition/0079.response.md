The code snippet `ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `ans` will be updated based on `a[3] - a[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration, `a` is the list after all updates, `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a` for all `i` up to the current value and then further multiplied by `a[3] - a[2]`, `i` is 3**.

In natural language: The value of `ans` has been updated to include the multiplication of the difference between the 3rd and 2nd elements of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
