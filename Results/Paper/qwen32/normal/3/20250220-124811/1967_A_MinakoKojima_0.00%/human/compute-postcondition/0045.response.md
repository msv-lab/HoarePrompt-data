To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop and understand how the variables `a`, `k`, and `m` change with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99.
  - `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0.
  - `k` is initially given.
  - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
  - `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`.
  - `ans` is 0.

- **Loop Body:**
  - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
    - `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
    - `k` is decremented by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
    - `m` is recalculated as the minimum value in the list `a` after the update to `a[i]`.

### Observations:
- Each iteration modifies `a[i]` based on the current value of `k` and recalculates `m` after each update.
- The value of `k` is reduced in each iteration.
- The loop runs `n` times.

### Final State After All Iterations:
- **`a`**: Each element `a[i]` will be updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- **`k`**: After `n` iterations, `k` will have been reduced by the sum of `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for each `i`.
- **`m`**: The minimum value in the list `a` after all updates.
- **`t`**, **`n`**, and **`ans`**: Remain unchanged throughout the loop.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the remaining value after all iterations; `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`; `ans` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, each element in the list `a` is adjusted based on the initial `k` and the minimum value `m`, and `k` is reduced accordingly. The variable `t` and `ans` remain unchanged, while `m` is the smallest value in the updated list `a`.
