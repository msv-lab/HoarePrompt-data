Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input minus `n * m`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; If `k` >= `n` * `m`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`; `ans` is the product of all `(a[i] - a[i-1])` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The number of iterations left is one less than before; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` has been updated by subtracting `n * m` from it. All other variables retain their previous states or conditions.
