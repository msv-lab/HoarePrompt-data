To determine the output state, let's break down the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99.
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The code modifies the value of `a[i]`. To find the new value of `a[i]`, we need to consider the expression `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.

Let's denote:
- `a[i]` as the original value before the assignment.
- `a[i]_new` as the new value after the assignment.

The new value of `a[i]` is calculated as:
```python
a[i]_new = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
```

Therefore, the output state will be:
- `t` remains the same: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99.
- `n` remains the same: `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0.
- `i` remains the same (since it is incremented before this code snippet, we assume `i` is already incremented and this code is modifying `a[i]`).
- `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.**
