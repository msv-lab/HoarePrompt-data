The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of those components to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t` and `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
