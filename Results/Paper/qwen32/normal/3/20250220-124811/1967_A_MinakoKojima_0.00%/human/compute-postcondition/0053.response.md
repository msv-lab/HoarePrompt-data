To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve through each iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
```

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. This means that the loop will execute `n-1` times. The variable `ans` is updated in each iteration by multiplying it with the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i-1]`.

The output states provided for the first 3 iterations indicate that `ans` is updated in each iteration by multiplying it with the difference `(a[i] - a[i-1])`. Therefore, after all `n-1` iterations, `ans` will be the product of all these differences.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the input parameter.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `a` is updated in each iteration, but the exact values of `a` are not specified in the problem statement. However, the way `a` is updated does not affect the final value of `ans` directly, only the differences between consecutive elements.
- `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`, but it is not directly relevant to the final value of `ans`.
- `ans` is the product of all differences `(a[i] - a[i-1])` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the remaining value after all iterations; `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`; `ans` is the product of all `(a[i] - a[i-1])` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, the variable `ans` will hold the product of the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in the list `a` from the first to the last element. All other variables remain in their initial states or updated states as per their definitions outside the loop.
