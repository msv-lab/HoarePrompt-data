The code `arr = input().split()` takes a new input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the new value of `arr` will be the list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `x` is the second integer read from the new input; `y` is the third integer read from the new input; `arr` is a list of strings obtained from the new input.**
