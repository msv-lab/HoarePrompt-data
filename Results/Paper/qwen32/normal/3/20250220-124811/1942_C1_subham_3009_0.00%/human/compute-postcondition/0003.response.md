Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The current execution is within the main module (`__name__ == '__main__')`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so if it was initially between 1 and 10^4, it is now between 0 and 10^4. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
