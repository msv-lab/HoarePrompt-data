Output State: **t is 0; n, x, y, and arr are undefined or out of scope.**

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will no longer be defined or in scope outside the loop body after the loop finishes executing all its iterations.
