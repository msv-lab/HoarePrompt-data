### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals from a set of vertices chosen on a regular polygon. For this specific version of the problem, \( y = 0 \), meaning no additional vertices can be chosen beyond the \( x \) vertices already selected by Bessie.

The key insight here is that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from \( x \) vertices on a polygon is \( x - 2 \). This is because any set of \( x \) vertices can form a polygon, and the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals within this polygon is \( x - 2 \).

The given program correctly implements this logic. For each test case, it reads the number of sides of the polygon \( n \), the number of vertices \( x \) that Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of additional vertices \( y \) (which is always 0 in this version). It then reads the \( x \) vertices Bessie has chosen and calculates the maximum number of triangular pieces as \( x - 2 \). This calculation is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from the given vertices. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
