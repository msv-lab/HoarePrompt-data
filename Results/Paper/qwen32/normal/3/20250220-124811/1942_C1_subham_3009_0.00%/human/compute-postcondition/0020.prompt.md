Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The current execution is within the main module (`__name__ == '__main__')`. `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    print(x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer read from input; `arr` is a list of integers read from input.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `x` is the second integer read from the new input; `y` is the third integer read from the new input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is at least 0; `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `x` is the second integer read from the new input; `y` is the third integer read from the new input; `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the rest are strings.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
