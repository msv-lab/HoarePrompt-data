The value of `t` is decreased by 1. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 0 (since it was at least 1 initially and has been decremented by 1); `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `x` is the second integer read from the new input; `y` is the third integer read from the new input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `x` is the second integer read from the new input; `y` is the third integer read from the new input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input.**
