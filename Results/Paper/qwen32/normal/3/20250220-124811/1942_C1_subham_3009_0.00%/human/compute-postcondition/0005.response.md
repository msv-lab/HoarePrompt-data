The code snippet `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer read from input; `arr` is a list of substrings read from input.**
