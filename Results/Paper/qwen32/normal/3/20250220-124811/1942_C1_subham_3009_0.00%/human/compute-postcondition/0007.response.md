To determine what will be printed by the `print(x - 2)` statement, we need to understand the value of `x` based on the given initial state.

From the initial state:
- `x` is an integer read from input such that \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\).

The print statement is:
```python
print(x - 2)
```

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `x`.

The expression `x - 2` will be evaluated by subtracting 2 from the value of `x`. Given the range of `x`, the smallest possible value of `x` is 2. Therefore, the smallest possible value of `x - 2` is \(2 - 2 = 0\).

The largest possible value of `x` is \(\min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\). However, without the specific value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact upper bound of `x`. But we know that `x` will be at most \(2 \cdot 10^5\). Thus, the largest possible value of `x - 2` would be \(2 \cdot 10^5 - 2\).

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be `x - 2`, where `x` is an integer in the range \([2, \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)]\).

Output: **x - 2 (where x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5))**
