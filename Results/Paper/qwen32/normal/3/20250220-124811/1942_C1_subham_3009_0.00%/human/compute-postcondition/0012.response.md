The code snippet modifies the list `arr` by converting each element from a string to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `x` is the second integer read from the new input; `y` is the third integer read from the new input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input.**
