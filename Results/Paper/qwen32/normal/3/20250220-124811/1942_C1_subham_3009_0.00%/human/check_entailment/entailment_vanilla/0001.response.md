Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: We need to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a given set of vertices in a regular polygon.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The polygon has `n` sides.
   - `x` vertices are already chosen.
   - `y` is the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen (`y = 0` in this problem).
   - No more vertices can be chosen (`y = 0`).
3. **Output**: The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Key Observations:

- Since `y = 0`, we cannot choose any additional vertices. We have to work with the `x` vertices already chosen.
- To form a triangle, we need at least 3 vertices.
- The maximum number of triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2` if the vertices are chosen in such a way that they can form a triangulation.

### Explanation of the Code:

The provided code does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - Reads the `x` vertices.
   - Outputs `x - 2`.

### Verification:

- The code correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The core logic of the code is to output `x - 2` for each test case, which is correct based on the problem's constraints and observations.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct for the given problem constraints and the provided examples. It correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed with the given vertices.

**Correctness: True**
