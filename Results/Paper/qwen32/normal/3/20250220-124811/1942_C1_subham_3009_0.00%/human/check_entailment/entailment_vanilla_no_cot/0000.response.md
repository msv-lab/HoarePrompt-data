Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply outputs `x - 2` for each test case, which is not the correct approach to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the vertices chosen by Bessie and determine how many non-overlapping triangles can be formed using these vertices. Since `y = 0`, we cannot add any more vertices, so we need to make the best use of the `x` vertices already chosen.

Here's a brief outline of the correct approach:
1. Sort the chosen vertices.
2. Use a greedy or dynamic programming approach to count the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using these vertices.

The provided program does not implement this logic and thus is incorrect.
