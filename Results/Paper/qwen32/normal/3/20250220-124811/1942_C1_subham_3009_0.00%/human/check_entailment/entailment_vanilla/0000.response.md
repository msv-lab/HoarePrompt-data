Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if the code is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices out of these `n` vertices. The task is to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed using these `x` vertices and no additional vertices (`y = 0`).

### Key Observations

1. **Triangular Pieces**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices. If we have `x` vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed without any additional vertices is determined by how many sets of 3 vertices we can pick from these `x` vertices.

2. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: The problem specifies that the diagonals must not intersect. This means that once a triangle is formed, the remaining vertices must be such that no additional diagonals can be drawn without intersecting the existing ones.

3. **Maximum Triangles**: Given `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`. This is because each triangle uses up 3 vertices, and the structure of a polygon allows us to form `x - 2` triangles when `x` vertices are chosen. This is a known result in computational geometry and graph theory.

### Code Analysis

The provided code does the following:

1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`.
3. It reads the list of `x` vertices.
4. It prints `x - 2` for each test case.

### Conclusion

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed given `x` vertices in a polygon. The formula `x - 2` is correct based on the problem's constraints and the geometric properties of polygons.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
