The `print(2)` statement in the provided code snippet will simply print the integer `2`. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` do not affect the output of this particular print statement because the statement does not reference these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. The variables `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
3. The variable `m` is an integer read from input and is less than both `a` and `b`.
4. The variable `i` is not initialized.

The `print(2)` statement directly prints the integer `2` without using any of the input variables or the uninitialized variable `i`.

Output: **2**
