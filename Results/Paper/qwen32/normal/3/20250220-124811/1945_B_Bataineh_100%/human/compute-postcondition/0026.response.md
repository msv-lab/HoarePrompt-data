The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet, and `i` was incremented by 1 before this code snippet was executed, so `i` is now `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input, `i` is `i + 1`**
