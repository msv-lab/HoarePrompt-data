In the given task, the for loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already given as an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

The variable `i` is the loop variable that will take values from 0 to `t-1` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be initialized because it is automatically set to 0 at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `t` is within the specified range, which is already satisfied by the problem statement.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is not initialized before the loop starts**
