To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, the value of `t` is not used in the print statement.
2. `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input.
3. `i` is incremented by 1, but `i` is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2 + m // b)
```

Here, `m // b` represents the integer division of `m` by `b`. This operation will yield the quotient of the division, discarding any remainder.

Let's denote:
- The value of `m // b` as `quotient`.

The print statement will output the result of `2 + quotient`.

Since the exact values of `m` and `b` are not specified, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `quotient`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `m` and `b`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **2 + m // b (where m // b is the integer division of m by b)**
