The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, it prints a specific value: 2 if `m` is less than both `a` and `b`; 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `b` if `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`; 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a` if `m` is less than `b` and greater than `a`; or the sum of the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `m` by `b` plus 2 otherwise.
