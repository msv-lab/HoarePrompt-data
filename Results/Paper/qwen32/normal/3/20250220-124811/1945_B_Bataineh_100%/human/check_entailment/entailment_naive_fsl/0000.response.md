Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed, especially in the way it handles the overlaps of fireworks from both installations.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**

- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times: 3, 6, 9, 12, ...
- Fireworks are visible for 6 minutes (from launch to launch + 5 minutes).

If we look at the time intervals where fireworks are visible:

- At time 2: Only the first installation's firework is visible.
- At time 3: Only the second installation's firework is visible.
- At time 4: Only the first installation's firework is visible.
- At time 5: Only the first installation's firework is visible.
- At time 6: Both fireworks from the first and second installations are visible.
- At time 7: Both fireworks from the first and second installations are visible.
- At time 8: Only the first installation's firework is visible.
- At time 9: Only the second installation's firework is visible.
- At time 10: Only the first installation's firework is visible.

Thus, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 (at times 6 and 7).

However, the provided program would output `4` for this test case, which is incorrect. The logic in the program does not correctly account for the overlaps and the number of fireworks visible at each time interval.

Given this example, the program is incorrect, and thus the Correctness is **False**.
