The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state mentions that `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `i` are already defined, with `i` being incremented by 1. However, the code snippet will overwrite the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` with new inputs. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `i` has already been incremented and thus remains at its new value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input, `i` is incremented by 1.**
