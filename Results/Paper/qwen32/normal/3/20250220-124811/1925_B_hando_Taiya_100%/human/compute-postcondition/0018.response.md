The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The variable `i` is not updated in this snippet, so its value remains `i + 1` as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i + 1`.**
