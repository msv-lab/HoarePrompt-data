The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `x` and `n`. Given the initial state, `t` is not affected by this code snippet, and `x` and `n` are updated to the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= n <= x, and `x` and `n` are updated to the values read from the input.**
