The code snippet provided increments the value of `win_with_swap` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `win_with_swap` is defined as `wins + 2` if `a[i] > a[k-1]`, otherwise `wins + 1`. Since the code snippet increments `win_with_swap` by 1, the new value of `win_with_swap` will be `win_with_swap + 1`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `wins`, `i`) remain unchanged, and the condition that `win_with_swap` is less than `k - 1` still holds as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are not greater than `a[k-1]` and `wins` is less than k - 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 1` and is less than k - 1.**
