You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the number of elements in `a` that are strictly less than `a[k-1]`, considering possible swaps to maximize this count without exceeding `k` elements. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it accurately computes the maximum number of wins the cow at position \( k \) can achieve, given the rules of the tournament and the option to swap positions once.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (the number of cows) and \( k \) (the position of the cow of interest).
   - It then reads the list of Cowdeforces ratings of the cows.

2. **Initial Wins Calculation:**
   - The program calculates how many matches the cow at position \( k \) can win if no swap is made.
   - It iterates through the list starting from position 1 and counts the number of cows with ratings lower than the cow at position \( k \) until it encounters a cow with a higher rating.
   - This count is stored in the variable `wins`.

3. **Handling No Wins:**
   - If `wins` is greater than or equal to \( k \), the cow at position \( k \) cannot win any matches because it is not strong enough to defeat any of the cows before it. The program prints `wins - 1` in this case, which is `0` because `wins` would be at least `k` and thus `wins - 1` would be at least `k - 1`, but the logic seems incorrect here and should be `0` directly.

4. **Wins with Swap:**
   - The program then calculates the maximum number of wins the cow at position \( k \) can achieve if it swaps with another cow.
   - It considers the possibility of swapping the cow at position \( k \) with a cow at any position \( i \) where \( i \) is greater than the number of initial wins (`wins`) and less than \( k \).
   - It iterates from `win_with_swap` (initially `wins + 1`) to \( k - 1 \) and counts the number of cows with ratings lower than the cow at position \( k \) until it encounters a cow with a higher rating.
   - The total number of wins with the swap is calculated as `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.
     - `win_with_swap - wins - 1` accounts for the additional wins after the swap.
     - `(wins != 0)` ensures that if the cow wins at least one match without swapping, it can still win one match after the swap, even if it loses the first match after the swap.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum of the wins with and without the swap.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for handling the case when `wins` is greater than or equal to \( k \) seems incorrect. The cow should not be able to win any matches if it is not strong enough to defeat any of the cows before it, so it should print `0` directly in this case.
- The logic for calculating `win_with_swap` seems correct, but the handling of the edge cases and the logic to determine the maximum wins needs to be carefully verified.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect handling of the case when `wins` is greater than or equal to \( k \), the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
