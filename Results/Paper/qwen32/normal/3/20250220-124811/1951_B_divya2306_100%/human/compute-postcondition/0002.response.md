The code snippet initializes a variable `wins` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `wins` while keeping the initial conditions of the other variables intact.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is 0.**
