To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables `wins` and `win_with_swap`, and how they are used in the expression `max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0))`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `wins`:**
   - `wins` is defined as the number of elements in the list `a` that are not greater than `a[k-1]`.
   - `wins` is also given to be less than `k`.

2. **Understanding `win_with_swap`:**
   - `win_with_swap` is defined as the number of elements from index `win_with_swap` to `k - 2` that are not greater than `a[k-1]`, plus the initial value of `win_with_swap`.
   - The exact value of `win_with_swap` is not directly given, but it is related to the count of elements not greater than `a[k-1]` in a specific range of the list.

3. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression inside `max` is `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.
   - `wins - 1` is straightforward.
   - `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` involves the count of elements not greater than `a[k-1]` in a specific range, adjusted by the value of `wins` and a condition `(wins != 0)` which evaluates to 1 if `wins` is not zero, and 0 otherwise.

### Key Observations:

- Since `wins` is the count of elements not greater than `a[k-1]` and is less than `k`, it implies that there are at least `k - wins` elements greater than `a[k-1]` in the list.
- The value of `win_with_swap` is influenced by the elements in the list from index `win_with_swap` to `k - 2`, but without the exact list, we can only reason based on the given conditions.
- The expression `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` can be simplified based on the conditions provided. Since `wins` is less than `k`, and `win_with_swap` is related to the count of elements not greater than `a[k-1]` in a specific range, the term `win_with_swap - wins - 1` will be non-negative or zero, and adding `(wins != 0)` ensures that the expression doesn't become negative when `wins` is non-zero.

### Conclusion:

Given the constraints and the definitions, the expression `max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0))` simplifies to `wins - 1` because `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` is always less than or equal to `wins - 1` under the given conditions.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be `wins - 1`.

### Final Output:

Output: **wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in `a` that are not greater than `a[k-1]` and is less than `k`)**
