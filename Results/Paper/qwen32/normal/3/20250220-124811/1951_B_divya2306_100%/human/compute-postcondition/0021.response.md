Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; wins is the number of elements in a that are not greater than a[k-1]; i is n-1 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise the index where a[i] > a[k-1]; wins is less than k; win_with_swap is wins + 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `win_with_swap` has been updated to be `wins + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
