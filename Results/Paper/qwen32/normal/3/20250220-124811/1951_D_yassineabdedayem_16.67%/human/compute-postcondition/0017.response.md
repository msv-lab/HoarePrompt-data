Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n = n - Min * Max`; `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is min(n // k, k); `Max` is max(int(n / k), k). If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `number` is `Max`.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `rep` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
