The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since `t` is `t-1` at the end of the previous iteration, to start the next iteration, `t` should be incremented by 1, making it `t`.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is 0, `k` is either 0 or not 0, `rep` is 3, `tab` is ['3', '2', '1'] if `k` is not 0, otherwise `tab` is ['3', '2', '1', 'new_element'], `number` is 1**
