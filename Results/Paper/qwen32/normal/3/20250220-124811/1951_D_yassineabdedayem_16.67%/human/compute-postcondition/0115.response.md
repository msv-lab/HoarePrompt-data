Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's calculate the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is `t`
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`
- `k` is a positive integer
- `rep` is `0`
- `tab` is `[]`
- `number` is `Max`
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`
- `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`

Code Snippet:
```
k = k - Min
```

The code snippet modifies the value of `k` by subtracting `Min` from it. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)`, `rep` is `0`, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

In natural language: The value of `k` is now `k - min(n // k, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
