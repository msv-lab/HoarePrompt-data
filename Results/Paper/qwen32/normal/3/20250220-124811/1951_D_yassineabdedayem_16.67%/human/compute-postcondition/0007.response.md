The code calculates the minimum and maximum values between `n // k` and `k`, and assigns them to `Min` and `Max` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is a positive integer such that k <= n; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is min(n // k, k); `Max` is max(int(n / k), k)**.
