The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `Max` from it. Given that `k` is 3 and `Max` is also 3, the new value of `k` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 5, `k` is 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is 1, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 3. `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**
