The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`. Given the initial values, `k` is 2 and `Min` is 1, so `k` becomes `2 - 1`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 2, `k` is 1, `rep` is 1, `tab` is either `['1']` or `['3']`, `number` is 2, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 2**.
