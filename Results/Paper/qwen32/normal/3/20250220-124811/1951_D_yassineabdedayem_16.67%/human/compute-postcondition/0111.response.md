The code snippet assigns the value of `Min` to the variable `number`. Given the initial conditions, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`. Since `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it implies that `Min` must be `1` (as `Min` cannot be greater than `k` and `n * Min <= k` restricts `Min` to be `1` if `n` is greater than `1` and `k` is positive).

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is `0`, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is `1`, `Min` is `1`, `Max` is `k`**.
