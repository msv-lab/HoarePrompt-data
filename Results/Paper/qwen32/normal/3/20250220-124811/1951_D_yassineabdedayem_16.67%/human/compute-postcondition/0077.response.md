The code snippet `n -= Min * Max` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from it.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is 2
- `Min` is 1
- `Max` is 2

The product of `Min` and `Max` is `1 * 2 = 2`. Therefore, `n` will be updated as `n = 2 - 2 = 0`.

The other variables (`t`, `rep`, `tab`, `k`, `number`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is either `['1', '1']` or `['3', '2']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 2. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 1 and `number` is 2.**
