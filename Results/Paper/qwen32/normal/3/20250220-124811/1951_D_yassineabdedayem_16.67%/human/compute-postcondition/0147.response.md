Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is `t` (This seems like a placeholder or typo, as `t` is not further defined or used in the print statement.)
  - `n` is 0 or less than `k`
  - `k` is 0
  - `rep` is the number of iterations (less than 60)
  - `tab` is a list of string representations of numbers with at least one element
  - `number` is the last number calculated
  - `i` is the next element in `tab`

- **Print Statement:**
  ```python
  print(i, end=' ')
  ```

Given the initial state, we know that `i` is the next element in the list `tab`. Since `tab` is a list of string representations of numbers and has at least one element, `i` will be the first element of `tab` (because `i` is defined as the "next element" and no specific index is mentioned, implying the start of the list).

Let's denote the first element of `tab` as `tab[0]`. Since `tab` contains string representations of numbers, `i` will be `tab[0]`.

Therefore, the print statement will print the first element of the list `tab`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

**Output:**
Output: **tab[0] (where tab[0] is the first element of the list tab)**
