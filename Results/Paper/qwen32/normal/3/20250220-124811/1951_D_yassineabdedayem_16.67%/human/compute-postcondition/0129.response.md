Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is `n - 2 * Min * Max`, `rep` is `2`, `tab` is `['number', str(number)]`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is `k - Min - Max` and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 2 * Min` and `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation: The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, so `rep` is now `2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
