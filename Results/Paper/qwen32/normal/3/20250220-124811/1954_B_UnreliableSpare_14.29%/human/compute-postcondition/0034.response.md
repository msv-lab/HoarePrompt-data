Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `flag` is True if `arr[0] == arr[1] == ... == arr[n-1]`, otherwise `flag` is False; `val` is `arr[0]`; `i` is `n`; `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of elements equal to `val` if the last sequence is equal to `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `ans` is the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val` found in `arr`, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the smaller of its previous value and `cnt`. All other variables retain their original values.
