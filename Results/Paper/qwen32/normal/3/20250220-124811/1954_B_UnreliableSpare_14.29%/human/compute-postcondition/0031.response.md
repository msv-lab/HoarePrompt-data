The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. 

Given the initial state:
- If `cnt` is 2, `ans` was initially set to `Decimal('Infinity')`. After executing the code, `ans` will be updated to 2.
- If `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` was initially set to 0. Since `min(0, cnt)` will still be 0 for `cnt` values of 0 or 1, `ans` will remain 0.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `flag` is True if `arr[0] == arr[1] == ... == arr[n-1]`, otherwise `flag` is False; `val` is `arr[0]`; `i` is 2; `cnt` is 2 if `arr[i]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` is either 0 or 1; `ans` is 2 if `cnt` is 2, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
