Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Initialization and Basic Checks:**
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same using a `flag`. If all elements are the same, it outputs `-1` (which is correct according to the problem statement).
   - However, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.

2. **Counting Consecutive Elements:**
   - The program then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same (`cnt`), and keeps track of the minimum count of such consecutive elements (`ans`).
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the structure of the array and the specific operation allowed (replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`).

3. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removal:**
   - The program calculates `ans` as the minimum count of consecutive elements, but this does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beautiful" property.
   - For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`:
     - The program will calculate `ans` as `3` (the count of consecutive `3`s).
     - However, to make the array stop being beautiful, we need to remove three `3`s (the first three or the last three), not just the middle `5`.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the input:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The correct output should be `3` (remove the first three `3`s or the last three `3`s). However, the program will output `3` but for the wrong reason and might fail on other cases.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the longest subarray where the "beautiful" property holds and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break this subarray. This involves more complex logic than simply counting consecutive elements.

Thus, the given program is incorrect for some cases, and the Correctness is **False**.
