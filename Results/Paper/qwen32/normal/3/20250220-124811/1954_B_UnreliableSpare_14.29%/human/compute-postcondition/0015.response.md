Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `flag` remains unchanged unless `arr[i] != arr[i - 1]`, in which case `flag` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
