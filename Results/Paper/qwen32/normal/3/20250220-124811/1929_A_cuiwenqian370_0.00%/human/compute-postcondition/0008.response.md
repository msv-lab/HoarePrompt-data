Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`; `left` is not equal to `right`**

In natural language: The variable `new_arr` now contains the last element of `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
