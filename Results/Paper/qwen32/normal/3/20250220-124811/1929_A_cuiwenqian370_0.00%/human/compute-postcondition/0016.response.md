The code appends `arr[left]` to `new_arr`. Given the initial state, `left` is 1, and `new_arr` already has `arr[right]` appended to it. After the execution, `new_arr` will have `arr[right]` followed by `arr[left]` appended to it. The values of `left`, `right`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` is 1 if `n` is 2; otherwise, `right` is `n - 2`; `new_arr` has `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` appended to it.**
