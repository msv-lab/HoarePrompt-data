Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`; `left` is equal to `right`, and both are equal to `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The last element of `arr` (which is `arr[n-1]` since `left` and `right` are both `n-1`) has been appended to `new_arr`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
