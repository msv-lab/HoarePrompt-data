The provided code snippet only initializes a variable `max_beauty` to 0 and does not modify any other variables or perform any operations that would affect the initial state described. Therefore, the output state is simply the initialization of `max_beauty` with no changes to the other conditions or variables.

Output State: **`left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates; `right` will be equal to `left - 1`; `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes; `max_beauty` is 0.**
