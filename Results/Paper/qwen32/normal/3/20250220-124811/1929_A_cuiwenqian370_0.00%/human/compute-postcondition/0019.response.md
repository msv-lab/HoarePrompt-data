Initial State: `left` is 2; if `n` is 2, `new_arr` has the element at index 1 of `arr` appended to it; if `n` is greater than 2, `new_arr` has `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` appended to it if `left` equals `right` (only possible if `n` is 4); `right` is 1 if `n` is 2, otherwise `right` is `n - 2`.

The code provided is:
```
right -= 1
```

Impact of the code: The value of `right` is decremented by 1. The values of `left`, `n`, `arr`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged unless `right` was originally 1, in which case it will become 0.

If `n` is 2, `right` was originally 1, so now `right` is 0. If `n` is greater than 2, `right` was originally `n - 2`, so now `right` is `n - 3`.

Output State: **`left` is 2; if `n` is 2, `right` is 0; if `n` is greater than 2, `right` is `n - 3`; `new_arr` has elements appended based on the initial conditions; `arr` and `n` remain unchanged.**
