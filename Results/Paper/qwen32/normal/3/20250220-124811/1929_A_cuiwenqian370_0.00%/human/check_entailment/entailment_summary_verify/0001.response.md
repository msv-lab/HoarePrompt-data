Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after potentially rearranging the array. The goal is to find a rearrangement that maximizes this sum.

### Program Analysis

The program follows these steps:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Alternating Construction**: A new array is constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array.
4. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the new array is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
5. **Output**: The maximum beauty for each test case is printed.

### Function Summary

The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, sorts the list, and rearranges it such that the largest and smallest elements alternate. It then calculates and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in this rearranged list.

### Reasoning

The key idea behind the program is to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements. By alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements, the program tries to achieve this.

Let's consider the example provided:

- **Test Case 1**: `arr = [2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Alternating: `[3, 1, 2]`
  - Beauty: `|3-1| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3` (However, the optimal arrangement is `[1, 3, 2]` which gives `|1-3| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 2`)

- **Test Case 2**: `arr = [69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Alternating: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: `|69-69| + |69-69| = 0 + 0 = 0`

- **Test Case 3**: `arr = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Alternating: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`
  - Beauty: `|100-43| + |43-90| + |90-54| + |54-80| = 57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = 166` (However, the optimal arrangement is `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]` which gives `|43-100| + |100-54| + |54-90| + |90-80| = 57 + 46 + 36 + 10 = 159`)

- **Test Case 4**: `arr = [3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Alternating: `[4, 3, 3, 3]`
  - Beauty: `|4-3| + |3-3| + |3-3| = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1`

- **Test Case 5**: `arr = [2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - Alternating: `[2, 1]`
  - Beauty: `|2-1| = 1`

### Conclusion

The program's approach of alternating between the largest and smallest elements does not always yield the maximum beauty. For example, in the third test case, the program calculates a beauty of 166, but a more optimal arrangement yields a beauty of 159. This indicates that the program is not always correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program does not always produce the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.
