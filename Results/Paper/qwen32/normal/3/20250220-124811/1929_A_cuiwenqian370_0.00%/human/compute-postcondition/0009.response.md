The code appends the element at index `left` of the list `arr` to the list `new_arr`. Given that `left` is initially 0, the first element of `arr` is appended to `new_arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`; `left` is not equal to `right`.**
