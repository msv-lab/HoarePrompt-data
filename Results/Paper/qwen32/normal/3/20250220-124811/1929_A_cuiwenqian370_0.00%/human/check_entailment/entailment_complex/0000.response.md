### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

The provided program sorts the array first and then rearranges it in an alternating fashion between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This strategy is intended to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array is sorted in ascending order. This allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.

2. **Rearranging the Array:**
   - The program uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to pick elements from the sorted array. `left` starts at the beginning (smallest element), and `right` starts at the end (largest element).
   - It alternates between picking the largest remaining element (`arr[right]`) and the smallest remaining element (`arr[left]`), appending them to `new_arr`.
   - This arrangement ensures that the differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` are maximized.

3. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
   - This sum is returned as the maximum beauty of the array.

The provided annotated program and the explanation match this strategy. The rearrangement method described ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, thereby maximizing the beauty of the array.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array by rearranging its elements in an alternating fashion between the largest and smallest remaining elements. The provided comments and the logic of the program align with the problem description and the intended solution.
