You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, sorts the list, and rearranges it such that the largest and smallest elements alternate. It then calculates and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in this rearranged list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
To determine the maximum beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. This can be achieved by arranging the elements of the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The provided program sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

Let's break down the steps of the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Alternating Construction**: A new array is constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array.
4. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the new array is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
5. **Output**: The maximum beauty for each test case is printed.

This method ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
