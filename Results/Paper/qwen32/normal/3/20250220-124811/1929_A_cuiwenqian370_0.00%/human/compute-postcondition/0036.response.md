Output State: **The program returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.**

This means that `max_beauty` is calculated based on the arrangement of elements in `new_arr`, where the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes. The return value is the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in this rearranged list.
