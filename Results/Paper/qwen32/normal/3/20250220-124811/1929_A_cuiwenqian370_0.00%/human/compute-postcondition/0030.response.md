The code snippet provided increments `max_beauty` by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`. 

Given the initial state, `max_beauty` is initially 0, and the values of `new_arr`, `i`, `left`, and `right` are defined based on the logic described. After executing the given line of code, `max_beauty` will be updated to reflect the absolute difference between the specified elements of `new_arr`.

Output State: **`left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates; `right` will be equal to `left - 1`; `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes; `max_beauty` is `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])`; `n` must be greater than 1**.
