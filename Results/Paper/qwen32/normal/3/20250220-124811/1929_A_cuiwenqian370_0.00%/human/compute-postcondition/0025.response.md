The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Initially, `left` is 2, so after the increment, `left` becomes 3. The values of `n` and `right` remain unchanged. The condition for appending elements to `new_arr` is also unaffected by this change. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`left` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `right` is `n - 3`. If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` has `arr[2]` appended to it. Otherwise, `new_arr` has `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` appended to it in that order.**
