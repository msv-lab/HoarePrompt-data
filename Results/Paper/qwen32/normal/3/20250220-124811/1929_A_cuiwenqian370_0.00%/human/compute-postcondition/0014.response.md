The code appends the element at index `left` of the list `arr` to the list `new_arr`. Given that `left` is 1, `new_arr` will have the element at index 1 of `arr` appended to it. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` is 1 if `n` is 2; otherwise, `right` is `n - 2`; `new_arr` has the element at index 1 of `arr` appended to it.**
