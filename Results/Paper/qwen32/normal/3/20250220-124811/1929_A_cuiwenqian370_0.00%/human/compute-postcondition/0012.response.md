Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr` and, if `left` was not equal to `right` initially, also the first element of `arr`. `left` is 1 and `right` is `n - 2`. If `left` was equal to `right` initially, `new_arr` contains only the last element of `arr`.**

In simple terms, the value of `right` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
