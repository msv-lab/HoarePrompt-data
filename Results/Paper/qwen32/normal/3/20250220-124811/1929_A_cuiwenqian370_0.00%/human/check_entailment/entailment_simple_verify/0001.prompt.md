You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:

    #State: - `left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates.
    #- `right` will be equal to `left - 1`.
    #- `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes.
    #
    #Given the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop, the final state can be described as:
    #- `left` will be `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even.
    #- `right` will be `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even.
    #- `new_arr` will be a list where the elements are arranged in the described alternating order.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: `left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates; `right` will be equal to `left - 1`; `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes; `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
To determine the maximum beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. This can be achieved by arranging the elements of the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The provided program sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

Let's break down the steps of the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Alternating Construction**: A new array is constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array.
4. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the new array is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
5. **Output**: The maximum beauty for each test case is printed.

This method ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty. Therefore, the program is correct.
