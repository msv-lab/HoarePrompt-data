Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

In simpler terms, the list `arr` has been sorted from the smallest to the largest integer. All other conditions and values remain the same.
