The loop condition in the `while` statement is `left <= right`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the state must be adjusted so that `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr` and, if `left` was not equal to `right` initially, also the first element of `arr`.
- `left` is 1.
- `right` is `n - 2`.

If `left` was equal to `right` initially, `new_arr` contains only the last element of `arr`. However, since the loop condition `left <= right` must hold for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `left` is not greater than `right`.

### Analysis:
- Initially, `left` is 1 and `right` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.
- If `n = 2`, then `right` is `2 - 2 = 0`. In this case, `left` (which is 1) is greater than `right` (which is 0), and the loop will not execute. However, since the problem states that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `right` will always be at least 0, and `left` will be 1, ensuring `left > right` only when `n = 2`.
- For `n > 2`, `right` is at least 1, and `left` is 1, so `left <= right` holds true.

### Adjustment:
- For `n = 2`, the loop condition `left <= right` does not hold initially (`left` is 1 and `right` is 0). To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust `right` to be at least 1.
- For `n > 2`, no adjustment is needed as `left <= right` already holds.

### Conclusion:
- If `n = 2`, adjust `right` to be 1.
- For `n > 2`, no adjustment is needed.

Given the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`left` and `right`), the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr` and, if `left` was not equal to `right` initially, also the first element of `arr`, `left` is 1, and if `n` is 2, `right` is adjusted to 1; otherwise, `right` is `n - 2`.**

However, to simplify and adhere strictly to the requirement of only adjusting `left` and `right`:

State: **`left` is 1, `right` is 1 if `n` is 2; otherwise, `right` is `n - 2`.**
