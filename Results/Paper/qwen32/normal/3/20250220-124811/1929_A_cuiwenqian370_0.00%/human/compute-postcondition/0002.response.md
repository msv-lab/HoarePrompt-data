Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. All other variables (`n`, `arr`, and `new_arr`) remain unchanged.
