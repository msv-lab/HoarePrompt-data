The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and will output the string `'YES'`.
2. None of the variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `count_1`) are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
