Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 2; `n` is the integer input by the user; `s` is the new string input by the user; `count_1` is the number of '1's in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, no changes are made to the variables. If `count_1` is even, the condition `s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2` is evaluated, but there is no change to the variables regardless of whether the condition is true or false.**
