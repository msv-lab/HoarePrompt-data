Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers such that start <= end; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0 and `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an integer; `s` is a string input by the user. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is '00', the current value of `s` remains '00', otherwise `s` is not '00'. If `n` is not 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, then `count_1` is odd. If `count_1` is even, then either `s` does not contain exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' or `count_1` is not 2. If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, then `s` has exactly two '1's and they are consecutive.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 1; `n` is the integer input by the user; `s` is the new string input by the user. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is '00', the current value of `s` remains '00', otherwise `s` is not '00'. If `n` is not 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, then `count_1` remains odd. If `count_1` is even, then either `s` does not contain exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' or `count_1` is not 2. If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, then `s` has exactly two '1's and they are consecutive. Additionally, if `n` is not 2, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `s` remain unchanged regardless of whether `count_1` is odd or even. `t` is now `t - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 1; `n` is the integer input by the user; `s` is the new string input by the user. If `n` is equal to 2, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged regardless of the number of '1's in `s` or whether `s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
