The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `start`, `end`, and the precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer input by the user.
Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**
