The code snippet `count_1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. This will update the value of `count_1` based on the content of `s`. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2; `s` is a string input by the user; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.**
