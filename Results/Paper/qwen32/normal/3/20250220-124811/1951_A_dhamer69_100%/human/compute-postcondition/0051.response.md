To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to focus on the loop's head condition and how the variable `t` is modified within the loop. The loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, and `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

Given the initial state, `t` is the number of iterations the loop will perform. The loop executes exactly `t` times before terminating. After `t` iterations, `t` will be 0, and the loop will stop.

### Iteration Details:
- **First Iteration:** `t` is decremented to `t-1`.
- **Second Iteration:** `t` is decremented to `t-2`.
- **Third Iteration:** `t` is decremented to `t-3`.
- ...
- **Final Iteration:** `t` is decremented to 0.

### Final State:
After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the loop will terminate. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

### Output State:
Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 0.**

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished running. The values of `start` and `end` will remain the same as they were initially, as they are not altered by the loop.
