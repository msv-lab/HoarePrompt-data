Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2; `s` is a string input by the user; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`, and `count_1` is even. If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, then `s` has exactly two '1's and they are consecutive. Otherwise, either `s` does not contain exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' or `count_1` is not 2.**
