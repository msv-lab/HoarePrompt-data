The function reads an integer `t` and then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It prints 'YES' if the string `s` meets certain conditions related to the number of '1's in the string, and 'NO' otherwise. The conditions are: if `n` is 2, `s` must be '00' to print 'YES'. For `n` greater than 2, the number of '1's in `s` must be even, and if there is exactly one '11' and the total number of '1's is 2, it prints 'NO'.
