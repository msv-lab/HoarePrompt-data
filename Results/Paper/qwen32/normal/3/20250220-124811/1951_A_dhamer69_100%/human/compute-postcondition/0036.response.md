Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 1; `n` is the integer input by the user; `s` is the new string input by the user. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is '00', the current value of `s` remains '00', otherwise `s` is not '00'. If `n` is not 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, then `count_1` remains odd. If `count_1` is even, then either `s` does not contain exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' or `count_1` is not 2. If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, then `s` has exactly two '1's and they are consecutive. Additionally, if `n` is not 2, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `s` remain unchanged regardless of whether `count_1` is odd or even. `t` is now `t - 1`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `t` has been decreased by 1. All other variables (`start`, `end`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` if applicable) remain unchanged.
