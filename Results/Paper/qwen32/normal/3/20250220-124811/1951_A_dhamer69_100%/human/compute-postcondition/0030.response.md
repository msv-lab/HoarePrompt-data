The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` do not affect the output of this particular `print` statement because the string 'NO' is hardcoded and does not depend on any of these variables.

Output: **NO**
