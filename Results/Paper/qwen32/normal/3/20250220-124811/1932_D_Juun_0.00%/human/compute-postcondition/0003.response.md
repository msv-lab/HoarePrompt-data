The provided code snippet initializes an empty list called `answers`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The initial state of all other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is an empty list.**
