Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards`. The parameter `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS", and `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"). The function returns None in all cases.**
