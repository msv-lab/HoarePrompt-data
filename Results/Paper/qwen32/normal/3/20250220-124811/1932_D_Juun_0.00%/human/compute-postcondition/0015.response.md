Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`, which must be a valid card or part of a string containing valid cards; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is a list containing one string if `suits[suit]` was not `None`, which is the sorted combination of `suits[suit]` and `rank` concatenated with `suit`, or `answers` is an empty list if `suits[suit]` was `None`; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and each key has the value `None` except for the key `suit`, which is now `None` if `suits[suit]` was not `None`, or has the value `rank` if `suits[suit]` was `None`; `rank` is the rank of the first card in `cards`; `suit` is the suit of the first card in `cards`; `suit` is not equal to `trump`.**
