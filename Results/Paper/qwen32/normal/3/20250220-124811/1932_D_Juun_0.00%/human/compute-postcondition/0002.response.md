The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `trumps`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, and `trump`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`; `trumps` is an empty list.**
