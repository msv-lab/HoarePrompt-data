The code snippet `sum += i * n` increments the value of `sum` by the product of `i` and `n`. Given the initial state, the value of `sum` will be updated to its previous value plus `i * n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is 0, `sum` is the previous value of `sum` plus `i * n`, `j` is `n + r + 1`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**
