Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n + r + 1`, `i` is `n`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `r` is `i` and `sum` is updated to `sum` plus `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `r` is 0 and `sum` is updated to `sum` plus `n * n`.**
