The code snippet `sum += i * n` updates the value of `sum` by adding `i * n` to its current value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `r`) remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `sum` was 0, so after this operation, `sum` becomes `i * n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `sum` is `i * n`; `r` is 0; `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**
