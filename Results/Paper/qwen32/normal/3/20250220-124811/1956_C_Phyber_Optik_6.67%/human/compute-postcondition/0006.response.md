Given the code `r = i`, the variable `r` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `sum`, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`) remain unchanged. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we will represent `r` as being equal to `i` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `sum` is 0; `r` is `i`; the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true.**
