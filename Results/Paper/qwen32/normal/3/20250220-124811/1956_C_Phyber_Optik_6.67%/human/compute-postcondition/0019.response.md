The code snippet `sum += i * n` updates the value of `sum` by adding the product of `i` and `n` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Given that `i` is `i + 1`, it implies that `i` has already been incremented before this line of code is executed. Therefore, `i` is now one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `sum` is updated to `sum + i * n`.**
