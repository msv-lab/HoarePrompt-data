Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown

- **`t`**: An integer read from the input that is greater than or equal to 0. However, `t` is not directly used in the provided print statement.
- **`n`**: A non-negative integer input.
- **`r`**: The last `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative. This variable `r` is not directly used in the provided print statement.
- **`sum`**: The total accumulated sum based on some condition. This variable `sum` is not directly used in the provided print statement.
- **`j`**: Incremented by 1 from its previous value, ensuring `1 <= j <= n + r`. This variable `j` is not directly used in the provided print statement.

### Print Statement Analysis

The print statement is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

The `*` operator unpacks the elements of the `range` object, so the `print` function will output each element of the range separated by a space.

### Range Explanation

- `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
  - If `n` is 0, the range will be empty.
  - If `n` is 1, the range will be `[1]`.
  - If `n` is 2, the range will be `[1, 2]`.
  - If `n` is 3, the range will be `[1, 2, 3]`, and so on.

### Output

The output will be the numbers from 1 to `n`, each separated by a space.

### Final Answer

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input non-negative integer)**

If `n` is 0, the output will be an empty line.

Output: **(empty line if n is 0, otherwise numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces)**
