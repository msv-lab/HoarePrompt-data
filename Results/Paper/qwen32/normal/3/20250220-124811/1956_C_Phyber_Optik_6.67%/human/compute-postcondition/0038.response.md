To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and analyze the print statement:

1. **Variables and their Initial Values:**
   - `t`: An integer read from the input, which is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n`: An integer, which is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `r`: Computed as `(n + 1) // 2`, where `//` denotes integer division.
   - `sum`: The problem statement does not provide any information about the value of `sum`, so we will not consider it further as it is not used in the print statement.
   - `j`: The problem states that `j` is `j + 1` and is less than `n + r + 1`. However, this doesn't provide an initial value for `j`. For the purpose of this task, we will assume `j` has some value that is less than `n + r + 1` and has been incremented by 1 at some point before the print statement.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(1, j, end=' ')`.
   - This statement will print the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j`, with a space at the end.

3. **Output Based on Given Information:**
   - The value of `1` is explicitly known.
   - The value of `j` is not explicitly given, but we know it has been incremented by 1 and is less than `n + r + 1`.

Given the above analysis, the output will be:
Output: **1 [j] (where [j] is the value of j after it has been incremented by 1 and is less than n + r + 1)**
