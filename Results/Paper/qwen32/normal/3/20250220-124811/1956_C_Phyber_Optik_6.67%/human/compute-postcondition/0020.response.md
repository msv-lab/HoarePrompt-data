Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `i + 1`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `r` is set to `i + 1` and `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. Otherwise, `sum` is updated to `sum + i * n`.**
