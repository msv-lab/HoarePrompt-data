The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times, so its initial state does not need to be adjusted.

Given the loop:
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute `t` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
