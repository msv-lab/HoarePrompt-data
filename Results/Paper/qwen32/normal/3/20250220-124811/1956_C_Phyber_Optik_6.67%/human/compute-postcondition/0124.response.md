The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range from 1 to `n + r + 1` (exclusive of `n + r + 1`). At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + r`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `j` incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2, `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined, `j` is `n + r + 1`**
