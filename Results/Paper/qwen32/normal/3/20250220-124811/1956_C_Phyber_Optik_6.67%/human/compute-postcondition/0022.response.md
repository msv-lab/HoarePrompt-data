To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the computation involved in the variables `sum` and `n + r`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
2. **Variable `n`**: It is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1.
3. **Variable `r`**: It is computed as `(n + 1) // 2`. This means `r` is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2.
4. **Variable `sum`**: The initial state does not provide an explicit value for `sum` or a formula to compute it directly. Since `sum` is not defined in terms of other variables or constants in the given information, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe it as a computed sum based on the context.

### Computation:
- `r` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `n + r` is the sum of `n` and `r`.

### Output:
The print statement `print(sum, n + r)` will output the value of `sum` and the value of `n + r`.

Since the exact value of `sum` is not provided, we will describe it in terms of the context. The value of `n + r` can be computed directly using the value of `n`.

### Example Calculation:
For example, if `n` is 5:
- `r = (5 + 1) // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3`
- `n + r = 5 + 3 = 8`

However, since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we will keep the answer in terms of `n`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **sum (where sum is the computed sum), n + r (where r is (n + 1) // 2)**
