To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Given the loop statement `for i in range(1, n + 1)`, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and `n` remains unchanged.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
2. Since the loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive), `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
3. The variable `n` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to increment `i` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now `i + 1`). If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `r` is set to `i + 1` and `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is increased by `i * n`.**

Since we are only concerned with the state of `i` and `n` at the start of the next iteration, the final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `i + 1`.**
