Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, the variable `r` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `sum`, `j`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is 0, `sum` is 0, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` still holds, with the exception that `r` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `r` is `i`, `sum` is 0, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**
