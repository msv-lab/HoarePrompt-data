The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range defined by `n + r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `n + r`.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `n + r + 1`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `j` at the start of the next iteration should be `j + 1` from its previous value.
- `n` and `r` remain unchanged as they define the range of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `r` is `(n + 1) // 2`; `sum` is the computed sum as described above; `j` is `j + 1` and is less than `n + r + 1`**
