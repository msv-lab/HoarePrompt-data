Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and does not generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve this sum. Let's analyze why:

1. **Sum Calculation Error**: The program attempts to calculate the sum by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each row/column until a certain condition is met, but this logic is flawed. The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible values in a way that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once per row and per column, which is essentially a Latin Square. The maximum sum is simply `n * n * (n + 1) / 2`.

2. **Operation Generation Error**: The operations generated by the program do not ensure that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once per row and per column. The operations are not carefully constructed to form a Latin Square, which would maximize the sum.

To correct the program, we need to fill the matrix in a way that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once per row and per column. One way to achieve this is by using a simple construction where the i-th row contains the numbers `i, i+1, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., i-1` (wrapping around). This ensures that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once per row and per column, and the maximum sum is `n * n * (n + 1) / 2`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        operations = []
        
        # Fill the matrix row by row
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            permutation = list(range(i, n + 1)) + list(range(1, i))
            operations.append((1, i, permutation))
        
        # Fill the matrix column by column
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            permutation = list(range(i, n + 1)) + list(range(1, i))
            operations.append((2, i, permutation))
        
        print(total_sum, len(operations))
        for op in operations:
            print(op[0], op[1], *op[2])

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the matrix is filled in a way that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once per row and per column, achieving the maximum possible sum with no more than 2n operations.
