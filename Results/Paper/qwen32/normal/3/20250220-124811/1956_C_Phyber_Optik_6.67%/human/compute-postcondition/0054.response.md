The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that the loop is about to start its next iteration, and `n` is at least 1.

Given that the loop is starting its next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. Since we do not have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` (assuming `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).

The value of `j` and the conditions for `r` and `sum` are derived from `i` and `n`, but they are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted directly for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `(i + 1) * n`, then `r` is `i + 1` and `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `r` is 0 and `sum` is `(i + 1) * n`, `i` is `i + 1`**
