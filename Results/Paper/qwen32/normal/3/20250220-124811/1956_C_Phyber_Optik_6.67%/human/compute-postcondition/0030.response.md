Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `r` is `(n + 1) // 2`; `sum` is the computed sum as described above; `j` is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the conditions remain as stated. If `j` is greater than `n`, the conditions also remain as stated.**
