Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n × n matrix filled with zeroes. The function handles up to 500 test cases, with the total number of elements across all matrices not exceeding 5 × 10^5. The function returns an n × n matrix filled with zeroes for each test case.**
