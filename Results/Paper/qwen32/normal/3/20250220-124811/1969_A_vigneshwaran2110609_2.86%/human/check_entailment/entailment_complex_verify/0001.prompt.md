You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True

    #State: The loop has completed all `n` iterations, and for each iteration, it has printed `3`. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state; `l` remains unchanged from its initial state for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it prints `2` if it is possible to rearrange the list `p` such that for each index `i`, `p_i` is not equal to `i` after a certain number of operations, otherwise it prints `3`. The function does not return a value; it only outputs the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

Monocarp needs to invite friends to his party such that at least two friends attend. A friend `i` will attend the party if both `i` and `p_i` (the best friend of `i`) receive invitations. The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least two friends attend.

### Key Points
1. Each friend `i` has a distinct best friend `p_i` and `p_i != i`.
2. Friend `i` will attend the party only if both `i` and `p_i` are invited.
3. We need to ensure at least two friends attend the party.

### Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we need to identify pairs of friends `(i, p_i)` and determine the minimum number of such pairs to invite. If there is a pair where `l[l[i] - 1] == i`, it means `i` is the best friend of `p_i` and vice versa, forming a mutual best friendship. In such cases, inviting both in the pair ensures that both attend. If no such mutual best friendship exists, we need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least two attend.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
```

1. The outer loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `x` (number of friends) and the list `l` representing the best friends.
3. The inner loop iterates over each friend `i` to check if `l[l[i] - 1] == i - 1`. This condition checks if `i` and `p_i` form a mutual best friendship.
4. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
5. If no such pair is found after the loop, it prints `3`.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Logical Error**: The condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is incorrect. It should check if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` to correctly identify mutual best friendships.
2. **Variable `flag`**: The variable `flag` is set but never used.
3. **Loop Variable Conflict**: The loop variable `i` is reused, which can lead to confusion and potential errors.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the provided program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
