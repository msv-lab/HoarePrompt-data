### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic Error in Invitation Calculation:**
   - The program checks for a condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, which doesn't accurately represent the problem's requirements. The goal is to find pairs of friends where both friends in the pair receive an invitation, and this condition doesn't help in identifying such pairs.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met, it can print `2` and break out of the loop. This is not a valid check for the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations. It should be checking for cycles or pairs in the list `p` to determine the minimum number of invitations needed.

3. **Output for All Test Cases:**
   - The program outputs `2` or `3` based on a flawed condition and does not correctly compute the minimum number of invitations for each test case.

### Correctness:

Given the logic errors and the incorrect handling of test cases, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
