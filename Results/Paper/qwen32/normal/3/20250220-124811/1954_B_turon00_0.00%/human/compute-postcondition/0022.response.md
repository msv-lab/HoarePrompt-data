Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `i` is 1. If `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, then `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0.**
