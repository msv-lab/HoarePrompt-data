The given code snippet increments the variable `cnt` by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `n`, and `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
