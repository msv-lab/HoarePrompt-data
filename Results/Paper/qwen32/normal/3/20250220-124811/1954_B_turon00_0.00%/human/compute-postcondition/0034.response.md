The code assigns the value of the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. The other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, and the list `a` itself) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`.**
