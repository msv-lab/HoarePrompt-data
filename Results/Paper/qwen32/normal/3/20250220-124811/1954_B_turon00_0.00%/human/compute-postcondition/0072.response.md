The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the new input integer `n`, `t` is `t - 1` and remains greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` remains `a[0]`, `aa` is the set containing unique elements from `a`, `cnt` is 1, and `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.
