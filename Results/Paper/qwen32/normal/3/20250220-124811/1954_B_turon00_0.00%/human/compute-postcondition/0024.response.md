Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1, and if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, then `ans` is `n` else `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
