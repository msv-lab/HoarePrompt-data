The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the value of `i` or the condition for `ans`. Therefore, `i` remains `i + 1` and `ans` remains the minimum of its previous value and the previous value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and the previous value of `cnt`; `cnt` is 0**.
