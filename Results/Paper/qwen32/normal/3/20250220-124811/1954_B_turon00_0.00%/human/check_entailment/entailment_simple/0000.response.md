### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) (or \(a_{i+1}\)) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

#### Key Observations:
1. If the array consists of only one unique element, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, hence the answer should be -1.
2. For other arrays, we need to find the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are the same. Removing all elements outside this subarray will make the array non-beautiful. The minimum number of elements to remove is the total number of elements minus the length of this longest contiguous subarray.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to be attempting to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray of the same elements and then calculating the minimum number of elements to remove. However, the logic in the program has some issues:

- The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and `cnt` to count the length of contiguous subarrays.
- It then iterates through the array, updating `cnt` whenever it encounters the same element as `tmp`. When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
- After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to consider the last contiguous subarray.
- Finally, it prints `n - ans` as the result, which is the number of elements to remove.

However, there are a few issues with this approach:
- The program does not correctly handle cases where the longest contiguous subarray is not starting from the first element.
- The logic for resetting `tmp` after finding a different element is missing, which means it will not correctly identify the longest contiguous subarray if it is not at the beginning of the array.
- The program does not handle cases where the array has multiple segments of the same maximum length correctly.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
