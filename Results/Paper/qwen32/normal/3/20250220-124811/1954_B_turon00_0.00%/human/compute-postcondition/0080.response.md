The code snippet provided resets the value of `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains 0 if `cnt` was 0 before, otherwise `ans` remains `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0 if `cnt` was 0, otherwise `ans` is `n`; `t` is `t - 1` and remains greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new input list of integers; `tmp` remains `a[0]`; `aa` is the set containing unique elements from `a`; `i` is incremented by 1; `cnt` is 0.**
