Output State: **The program returns a list that is the concatenation of `output2` and `output1`. `output2` contains the complementary divisors of `x` (i.e., `x // i` for each `i` in `output1`), and `output1` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in descending order.**

In simpler terms, the output is a list where the first part consists of the larger divisors of `x` (calculated as `x // i` for smaller divisors `i`), followed by the smaller divisors of `x` in descending order.
