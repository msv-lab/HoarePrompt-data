### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions and involves two segments: an ascending sequence from 1 to \( k \) and a descending sequence from \( k-1 \) to 2.

The provided program begins by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it calculates two potential values for \( 2k - 2 \):

1. \( n + x - 2 \)
2. \( n - x \)

For each of these values, the program finds all divisors and checks if they can be expressed in the form \( 2k - 2 \) where \( k \geq x \). If so, it adds \( k \) to the list of possible values.

The function `func_1(x)` computes all divisors of \( x \) efficiently by iterating up to the square root of \( x \). It returns the divisors in a specific order, which is then used to determine valid \( k \) values.

Let's analyze the program's correctness:

- **Divisor Calculation**: The function `func_1(x)` correctly computes all divisors of \( x \). This is crucial because the valid \( k \) values are derived from these divisors.
  
- **Checking Valid \( k \)**: The program checks if \( (s + 2) / 2 \) is a natural number (\( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \)) and if it is at least \( x \). This ensures that \( k \) is valid according to the problem's constraints.

- **Combining Results**: The program combines results from both potential values of \( 2k - 2 \) and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set.

- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where \( n - x \) or \( n + x - 2 \) might not yield valid \( k \) values. It also ensures that \( k > 1 \) by checking if \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
