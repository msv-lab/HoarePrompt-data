The code snippet converts the integer `f` to its binary representation, removes the '0b' prefix, and assigns the result to `l`. Given that `f` is `2`, its binary representation is '10'. Therefore, `l` is updated to '10'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `5`, `m` is `1`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `'10'`, `p` is `3`, `f` is `2`**
