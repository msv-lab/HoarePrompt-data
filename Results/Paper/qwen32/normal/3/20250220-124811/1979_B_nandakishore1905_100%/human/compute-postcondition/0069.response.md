To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `f & f - 1 != 0`. This condition checks whether `f` is not a power of two. If `f` is a power of two, the expression `f & f - 1` will be `0`, and the loop will not execute.

Given the state:
- `n` is `input_n`
- `m` is `input_m`
- `k` is `abs(input_n - input_m)`
- `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix
- `p` is the length of `l`
- `f` is `abs(input_n - input_m) - 2`

We need to adjust `f` so that it is not a power of two. Let's analyze the value of `f`:

- `f` is defined as `abs(input_n - input_m) - 2`
- For `f` to not be a power of two, `abs(input_n - input_m) - 2` should not be a power of two.

The smallest power of two is `1` (which is `2^0`), so `f` should not be `1`. This means `abs(input_n - input_m) - 2` should not be `1`, or equivalently, `abs(input_n - input_m)` should not be `3`.

Thus, we need to ensure that `abs(input_n - input_m)` is not `3`. If `abs(input_n - input_m)` is `3`, we need to change it to any other value.

Let's adjust `input_n` or `input_m` such that `abs(input_n - input_m)` is not `3`. For simplicity, we can choose `input_n` and `input_m` such that `abs(input_n - input_m)` is `4` (or any other value that is not `3`).

For example, if `input_n` is `5` and `input_m` is `1`, then `abs(input_n - input_m)` is `4`, and `f` becomes `4 - 2 = 2`, which is not a power of two.

State: **`n` is `5`, `m` is `1`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `'100'`, `p` is `3`, `f` is `2`**
