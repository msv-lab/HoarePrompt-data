The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference `k` and then determines and prints a specific value based on the properties of `k`. The printed value is either `k` if `k` is a power of two, `1` if `k` is odd, or the largest power of two less than or equal to the remainder when `k` is reduced by the largest power of two less than `k`, iteratively until the remainder itself is a power of two.
