Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that `0 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `n != m`.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The code snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the value of `k`. According to the initial state, `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The absolute difference between two numbers is always a non-negative number and is calculated as:
\[ k = |n - m| \]

Since `n` and `m` are distinct, `k` will always be a positive integer. The exact value of `k` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n` and `m`, but we can describe it precisely in terms of `n` and `m`.

Thus, the output of the `print(k)` statement will be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
