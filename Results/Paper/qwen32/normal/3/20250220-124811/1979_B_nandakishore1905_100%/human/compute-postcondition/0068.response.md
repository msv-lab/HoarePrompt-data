The value of `f` is assigned the result of `k - q`. Given that `k` is `abs(input_n - input_m)` and `q` is `2`, the value of `f` becomes `abs(input_n - input_m) - 2`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `m` is `input_m`, `k` is `abs(input_n - input_m)`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `f` is `abs(input_n - input_m) - 2`**.
