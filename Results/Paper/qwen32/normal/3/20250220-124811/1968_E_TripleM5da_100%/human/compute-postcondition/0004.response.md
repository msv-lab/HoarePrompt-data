The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 because the range starts from 3 and goes up to `n + 1`.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, this variable does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 3**
