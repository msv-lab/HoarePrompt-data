Given the initial state:
- `t` is unchanged (but its value is not specified, so it's irrelevant for this print statement).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is assigned the value of `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Since `i` is assigned the value of `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, the print statement will output the value of `i` (which is `n`) twice.

Therefore, the exact output will be the value of `n` printed twice.

Output: **n, n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 3)**
