The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that `3 <= i <= n`, and `n` is at least 3. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

Given that we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`. For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least `i + 1`.

Since we know that `i` was at least 3 at the start of the previous iteration and was incremented by 1 in each iteration, the smallest possible value of `i` at the start of the next iteration is 4. Hence, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4**
