To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is unchanged (the value of `t` is not relevant to the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `i` is defined as `n - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(i, i)`.

Given that `i` is defined as `n - 1`, the value of `i` will be `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` will be at least 2 (when `n` is 3).

The print statement will output the value of `i` twice. Since `i` is `n - 1`, the output will be `n - 1` followed by `n - 1`.

Output: **n - 1, n - 1 (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 3)**
