The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it is controlled by the `range(3, n + 1)` function. According to the code, the loop variable `i` starts from 3 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be one less than `n` because it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` should be `n - 1`.

Since `t` is mentioned as unchanged and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, these do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`**
