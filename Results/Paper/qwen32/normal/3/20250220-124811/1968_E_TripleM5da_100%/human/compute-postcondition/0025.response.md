Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is unchanged (the value of `t` is not specified or used in the print statement).
- `n` is the integer value of the input.
- `i` is set to the value of `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, 2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `i`. It simply prints the numbers `1` and `2`.

### Output:
The output will be the numbers `1` and `2` separated by a space.

Output: **1 2**
