To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variable `i` evolves. The loop starts with `i` set to 3 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` exceeds `n`. The loop prints `i, i` in each iteration.

The loop will execute for all integer values from 3 to `n` inclusive. Therefore, the final value of `i` after the loop has finished will be `n + 1`, because the loop terminates when `i` becomes `n + 1` (the loop condition `i in range(3, n + 1)` is no longer satisfied).

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is obtained from the `input()` function. The variable `t` is not affected by the loop, so it remains unchanged.

The output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
- `t` remains the same as the initial value.
- `n` remains the same as the value obtained from the `input()` function.
- `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop terminates.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is unchanged, n is unchanged, i is n + 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `t` and `n` will remain the same as they were at the start, and the value of `i` will be one more than `n`.
