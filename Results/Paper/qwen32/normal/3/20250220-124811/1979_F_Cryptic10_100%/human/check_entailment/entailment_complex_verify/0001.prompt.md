You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

Kostyanych has chosen a complete undirected graph^{\dagger} with n vertices,
and then removed exactly (n - 2) edges from it. You can ask queries of the
following type:

  * "? d " — Kostyanych tells you the number of vertex v with a degree at least d . Among all possible such vertices, he selects the vertex with the minimum degree, and if there are several such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. He also tells you the number of another vertex in the graph, with which v is not connected by an edge (if none is found, then 0 is reported). Among all possible such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. Then he removes the vertex v and all edges coming out of it. If the required vertex v is not found, then "0\ 0 " is reported. 

Find a Hamiltonian path^{\ddagger} in the original graph in at most n queries.
It can be proven that under these constraints, a Hamiltonian path always
exists.

^{\dagger} A complete undirected graph is a graph in which there is exactly
one undirected edge between any pair of distinct vertices. Thus, a complete
undirected graph with n vertices contains \frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges.

^{\ddagger} A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that passes through each
vertex exactly once.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Interaction

Interaction for each test case begins with reading the integer n .

Then you can make no more than n queries.

To make a query, output a line in the format "? d " (without quotes) (0 \le d
\le n - 1 ). After each query, read two integers — the answer to your query.

When you are ready to report the answer, output a line in the format "! v_1\
v_2 \ldots v_n " (without quotes) — the vertices in the order of their
occurrence in the Hamiltonian path. Outputting the answer does not count as
one of the n queries. After solving one test case, the program should
immediately move on to the next one. After solving all test cases, the program
should be terminated immediately.

If your program makes more than n queries for one test case or makes an
incorrect query, then the response to the query will be -1 , and after
receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to
receive the verdict Wrong answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.

After outputting a query, do not forget to output an end of line and flush the
output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Idleness limit
exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 

The interactor is non-adaptive. The graph does not change during the
interaction.

Hacks

To hack, use the following format:

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

Each of the following (n - 2) lines should contains two integers u and v (1
\le u, v \le n , u \ne v ) — ends of the edge that was removed from the graph.
Each edge must not occur more than once.

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^5 .

Note

In the first test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75d8c5328ccca8f82b69ba8300140bed4d40ce80.png)

Consider the queries:

  * There are no vertices with a degree of at least 3 in the graph, so "0\ 0 " is reported.
  * There are four vertices with a degree of at least 2 , and all of them have a degree of exactly 2 : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Vertex 1 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 4 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 1 . After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * There are three vertices with a degree of at least 1 , among them vertices 2 and 3 have a minimum degree of 1 (vertex 4 has a degree of 2 ). Vertex 2 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 3 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 2 . After this, vertex 2 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the second test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/44d26c229eaff752c0a00c7160792daef41c7502.png)

Consider the queries:

  * Vertex 1 has a degree of at least 3 , but it is connected to all vertices, so "1\ 0 " is reported. After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * The remaining vertices 2 , 3 , and 4 have a degree of at least 0 , but among them vertex 4 has the minimum degree of 0 (vertices 2 and 3 have a degree of 1 ). Vertex 4 is not connected to both vertices 2 and 3 , so vertex 2 is reported (as it has the minimum number). After this, vertex 4 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the third test case, the graph consists of 2 vertices connected by an edge.

The function has processed all t test cases and output the Hamiltonian path for each.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a graph. For each test case, it interacts with an external system by sending queries and receiving responses to determine a Hamiltonian path in the graph. After processing all test cases, it outputs the Hamiltonian path for each graph.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program in the context of the problem statement to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices from which `(n - 2)` edges have been removed.
- We need to find a Hamiltonian path in this graph using at most `n` queries.
- We can ask queries of the form "? d" to get information about vertices with a degree of at least `d`.
- The response to the query will give us a vertex `v` with the smallest degree (and smallest number among vertices with the same degree) and another vertex `u` that `v` is not connected to.
- We need to build the Hamiltonian path based on the responses to our queries.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a set `vx` containing all vertex numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - It also initializes an empty list `ops` to store operations (edges) that will be used to construct the path.

2. **Query Loop:**
   - While there are more than 2 vertices left in the set `vx`, the program makes a query with `d` set to `len(vx) - 2`.
   - The query response gives us a vertex `v1` and another vertex `v2` that `v1` is not connected to.
   - The vertex `v1` is removed from the set `vx`.
   - If `v2` is greater than 0, it means `v1` is not connected to `v2`, and the pair `(v1, v2)` is added to `ops`.
   - If `v2` is 0, it means `v1` is connected to all remaining vertices. The program then makes another query with `d` set to 0 to find another vertex `v3` that is not connected to `v1`. Both `v3` and `v1` are removed from `vx`, and the pairs `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are added to `ops`.

3. **Path Construction:**
   - After the loop, there are only 2 vertices left in `vx`. These are stored in `p1`.
   - The program then constructs the path by iterating over the operations in `ops` in reverse order.
   - For each operation `(v1, v2)`, it appends `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` based on whether the last vertex in `p1` is `v2`.
   - Finally, it prints the path by concatenating the reversed `p1` and `p2`.

### Correctness:
The program's strategy is based on the fact that a Hamiltonian path always exists in the given graph structure. The queries are designed to identify vertices and edges that can be used to construct the path. The program correctly handles the removal of vertices and the construction of the path based on the responses to the queries.

The logic for handling the queries and constructing the path is sound, and the program adheres to the constraints of the problem (i.e., it makes at most `n` queries and constructs a valid Hamiltonian path).

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
