Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v1`), `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(v1, v2)`, `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, and `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`. Additionally, `v2` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The list `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(v1, v2)`. All other variables retain their initial states.
