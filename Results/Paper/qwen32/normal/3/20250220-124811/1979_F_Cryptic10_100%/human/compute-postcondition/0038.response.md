Let's break down the given code and initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000.
- `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements.
- `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed.
- `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`.
- `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Reverse `p1`:** `p1[::-1]` reverses the list `p1`. If `p1` contains elements `[a, b, c]`, `p1[::-1]` will be `[c, b, a]`.
2. **Concatenate `p1[::-1]` and `p2`:** The lists `p1[::-1]` and `p2` are concatenated.
3. **Convert elements to strings and join with spaces:** `map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)` converts each element of the concatenated list to a string, and `' '.join(...)` joins these string elements with a space.
4. **Format and print:** The final string is formatted with a leading `'!'` and printed.

### Detailed Output Description:
- `p1` starts with the elements of `vx` and includes additional elements from `ops` until the last element of `p1` is not `v2`.
- `p2` includes elements from `ops` where the last element of `p1` equals `v2`.
- The final printed string will be `'!'` followed by the elements of `p1` in reverse order, concatenated with the elements of `p2`, all separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` depend on the specific operations and values in `ops` and `vx`, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **! [elements of p1 in reverse order] [elements of p2] (where p1 and p2 are lists defined based on the operations in ops and the set vx)**
