The function `func()` does not take any input parameters. The input is handled through standard input as described in the problem statement: first an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines each containing a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in the graph for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function must interact with the system by outputting queries and reading responses as specified in the problem statement to determine a Hamiltonian path for each test case.
