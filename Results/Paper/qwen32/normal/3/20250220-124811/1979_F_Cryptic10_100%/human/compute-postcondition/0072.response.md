The given code snippet appends `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. Let's break down the impact of this operation on the variables:

- **`p1`**: Initially, `p1` contains the elements of `vx` with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] != v2`. After the operation, `v1` will be appended to `p1` if `p1[-1] != v2`.
- **`p2`**: Initially, `p2` contains `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2`. After the operation, `v1` will be appended to `p2` if `p1[-1] == v2`.
- **`t`**, **`vx`**, and **`ops`**: These variables are not directly modified by the given code snippet, so their states remain unchanged.

Let's consider the two possible scenarios:

1. If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p1`.
2. If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.

Since the next tuple `(v1, v2)` to be processed is the second-to-last tuple in `ops`, the values of `v1` and `v2` are determined by this tuple.

**Output State:**
If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1` is updated to include `v1` at the end, and `p2` remains unchanged.
If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` is updated to include `v1` at the end, and `p1` remains unchanged.

Given the conditions, the output state can be described as follows:
- If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set containing 2 or fewer integers, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed and must contain at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] != v2` and `v1` appended again if `p1[-1] != v2` after the operation, `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2` and `v1` appended again if `p1[-1] == v2` after the operation.**
