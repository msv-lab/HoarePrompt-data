Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v1`), `ops` is a list, `v1` is `q(len(vx) - 2)[0]`, `v2` is `q(len(vx) - 2)[1]`.**

Explanation: The element `v1` has been removed from the set `vx`, which originally had at least 3 elements. Therefore, `vx` now has at least 2 elements. The values of `t`, `ops`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
