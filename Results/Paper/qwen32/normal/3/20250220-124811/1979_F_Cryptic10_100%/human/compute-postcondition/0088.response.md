The given code snippet appends two tuples to the `ops` list. The first tuple contains `(v3, 0)` and the second tuple contains `(v1, 0)`. The values of `v3` and `v1` are not explicitly provided, but we know that `v3` has already been removed from the set `vx`.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the execution of the code snippet:

- `t` remains an integer from 1 to 1000.
- `vx` remains a set of integers with at least 2 elements after removing `v3`.
- `ops` is no longer an empty list; it now contains two tuples: `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.
- `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them.
- `v2` remains less than or equal to 0.
- `v3` remains the result of `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.
- `v1` remains as it was, as it is only used in the tuple being appended to `ops`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v3`), `ops` is `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`, `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the result of `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.**
