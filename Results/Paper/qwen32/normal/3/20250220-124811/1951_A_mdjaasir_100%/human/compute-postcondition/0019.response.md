Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the value of the user's input; `count` is the number of '1's in `a`, and `count` is greater than 0; `count` is either less than 2 or `count` is odd. If `count` is equal to 2, the element immediately following the first '1' in `a` is either not '1' or is '1'. If `count` is not equal to 2, the conditions on `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count` remain as specified.**
