Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the next t lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, `b`, `c` <= 10^9; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is updated by adding `a` and `(b + c) // 3`. If `(b + c) % 3` is not equal to 0, `k` is further incremented by 1.**
