The provided Python code snippet reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. This affects the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` but does not directly affect the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, or `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `k` has not yet been computed in this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the next t lines contains three integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input. `i` is incremented by 1.**
