Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, it prints `-1` if `b` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `b` and `c` is less than 3. Otherwise, it calculates a value `k` as the sum of `a` and the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3, and increments `k` by 1 if the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, before printing `k`.**
