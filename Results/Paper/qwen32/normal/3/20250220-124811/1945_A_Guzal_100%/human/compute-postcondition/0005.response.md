Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - Each of the next `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input.
   - `k` is 0.
   - Additionally, `b` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `b % 3` and `c` is less than 3.

2. **Python Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(-1)` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the integer `-1`.
   - The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not reference any of these variables.
   - The conditions provided (such as `b` not being divisible by 3 and the sum of `b % 3` and `c` being less than 3) are constraints on the input data and do not influence the output of the given print statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output `-1` regardless of the specific values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `k`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **-1**
