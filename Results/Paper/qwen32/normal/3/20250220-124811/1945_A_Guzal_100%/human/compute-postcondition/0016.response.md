The given initial state describes a setup involving multiple variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `i`, or `k`. The `print` statement is:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement will always print the integer `-1`, regardless of the values of the other variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **-1**
