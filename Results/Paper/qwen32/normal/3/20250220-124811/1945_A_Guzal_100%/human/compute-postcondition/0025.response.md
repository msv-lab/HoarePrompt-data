The given initial state describes a program setup where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` are read. Additionally, variables `n`, `i`, and `k` are mentioned, but their specific roles in this context are not relevant to the given `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `i`, or `k`.

The `print(-1)` statement will simply output the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
