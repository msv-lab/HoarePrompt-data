Postcondition: **`ind` is an empty list, `c` is the count of cows with ratings greater than `x` (which is 0 in this case), `i` is the last index checked (potentially `n-1`). Additionally, if `k` is equal to 14, the specific actions or changes associated with `k` being 14 are executed, but since there is no else part, no other changes occur if `k` is not equal to 14.**
