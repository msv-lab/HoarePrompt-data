The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `j`. Since `j` was initially -1, after the increment, `j` becomes 0.

Output State: **`ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` (if the first element is not `h`) and any subsequent elements that are less than or equal to `h` after encountering an element equal to `h`, `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` has been encountered, otherwise 0, `j` is 0, `ans` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a list of integers from the input with the first element swapped with the element at index `k-1` and must have at least two elements, `h` is the first element of `s`**.
