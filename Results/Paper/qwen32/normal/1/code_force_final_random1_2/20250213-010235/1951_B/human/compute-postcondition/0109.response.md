Postcondition: **`s` must have at least one element. If `i` equals `h`, `z` is set to 1, and if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` does not equal `h`, no changes occur unless `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` equals 1, in which case `ans1` is incremented by 1.**
