Postcondition: **`ans1` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h` and `i` equals `h`; otherwise, `ans1` remains 0. `z` is 1 if `i` equals `h`; otherwise, `z` is 0. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `ans`, `p`, `i`) retain their initial values as described in the precondition.**
