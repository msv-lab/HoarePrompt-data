a is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case and contains n+2 integers. The first integer in each sublist is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t sublists starts with two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), representing the number of cows and the index of the cow owned by the player, respectively. The next n integers in the sublist represent the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and all a_i's are pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
