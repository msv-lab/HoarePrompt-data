The given code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `z`. None of the other variables (`p`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i`, `h`, `ans1`) are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`; the first element of `s` is the original first element, and the element at index `k-1` is the original element at index `k-1`; `s` has at least one element; `i` is the next element in `s` after the previous `i`. If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1; `z` is 1.**
