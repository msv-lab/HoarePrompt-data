The given code snippet simply resets the variable `ans1` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`; the first element of `s` is now the integer that was originally at index `k-1`, and the element at index `k-1` is now the integer that was originally the first element of `s`; `ans1` is 0; `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` was encountered, otherwise `z` is 0; `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `h` is the first element of `s` before the swap; `j` is `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise the last value of `j` before breaking; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`.**
