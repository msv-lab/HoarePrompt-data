Postcondition: **`ans1` is `ans1 + 1` if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h` and `i` equals `h`; otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged. If `i` equals `h`, `z` is 1; otherwise, `z` is 0. `i` is `next_i`, where `next_i` is the next element in the sequence `s` after the current `i`. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `ans`, `p`) retain their initial values. Additionally, `ans1` is incremented by 1 if `i` is greater than `h` and `i` equals `h`.**
