The code snippet sorts the string `s` in descending order and assigns the result to the variable `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the newly input `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the sorted version of `s`, `c` is the sorted version of `s` in descending order.**
