Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters; `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` is 2, then the length of `a` remains 2. Otherwise, `b` is the string `s` sorted in alphabetical order, `c` is the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order, and `s` is sorted in alphabetical order if `b` equals `s`; otherwise, `s` is not sorted in alphabetical order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the newly input `s`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If the length of `a` is 2, then the length of `a` remains 2. Otherwise, `b` is the string `s` sorted in alphabetical order, `c` is the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order, and `s` is sorted in alphabetical order if `b` equals `s`; otherwise, `s` is not sorted in alphabetical order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the newly input `s`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `len(a) == 2`, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted version of `s`, `c` is the sorted version of `s` in descending order. If `b` equals `s`, the string `s` is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the string `s` is not sorted in ascending order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
