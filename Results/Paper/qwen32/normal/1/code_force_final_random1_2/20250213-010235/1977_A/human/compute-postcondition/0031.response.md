Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is `i + 1` (Note: The initial value of `i` is not specified, but it is incremented by 1).
- `n` is the first integer read from the new input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the new input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'No'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

### Output:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'No'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **No**
