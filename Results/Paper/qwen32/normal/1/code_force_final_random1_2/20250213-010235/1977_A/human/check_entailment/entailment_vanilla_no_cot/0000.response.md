Let's analyze the given program against the problem statement.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. Therefore, after `n` moves, the difference between the number of moves (`n`) and the final number of cubes (`m`) must be even. This is because every pair of an addition and a removal results in no net change, and any remaining moves must either all be additions or all be removals, both of which result in an even difference.

The given program does not correctly implement this logic. Here are some issues:

- It checks if `n == m`, which is correct for one specific scenario but does not cover all cases where the difference is even.
- It checks if `m > n` and immediately prints 'No', which is incorrect because if `n - m` is even, it should be possible.
- It checks if `m == n - 1` and prints 'Yes', which is incorrect unless `n - m` is exactly 1, but it should check for even differences.
- It then checks if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd, which is not sufficient to determine if the difference is even.

A correct solution would simply check if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

Given these points, the original program is incorrect.

Your response:
Correctness: **False**
