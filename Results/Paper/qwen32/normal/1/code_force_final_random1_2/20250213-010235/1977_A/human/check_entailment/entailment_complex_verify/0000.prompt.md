You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations. The variable `i` is equal to `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `m` hold the values from the last test case processed. The program has printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each of the `t` test cases based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions related to the values of `n` and `m`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `m`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves:
1. If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
2. If `m > n`, it prints "No".
3. If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
6. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Checking for Correctness:
Let's consider various scenarios to see if the program handles all cases correctly:

1. **Case 1: `n == m`**
   - The program correctly prints "Yes".
   
2. **Case 2: `m > n`**
   - The program correctly prints "No" because more cubes than moves are impossible.

3. **Case 3: `m == n - 1`**
   - The program correctly prints "Yes" because we can add `n-1` cubes and remove one.

4. **Case 4: Both `m` and `n` are even**
   - The program correctly prints "Yes" because we can alternate adding and removing cubes to reach the desired number.

5. **Case 5: Both `m` and `n` are odd**
   - The program correctly prints "Yes" because we can similarly alternate adding and removing cubes.

6. **General Case: Parity Check**
   - The program seems to rely on the parity (even/odd nature) of `m` and `n` to decide if it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is generally correct because:
     - If `n` is even, we can end up with any even `m` between 0 and `n`.
     - If `n` is odd, we can end up with any odd `m` between 0 and `n`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Edge Case 1: `m = 0`**
  - If `n` is even, the program will print "Yes" because `m` can be 0 by alternating additions and removals.
  - If `n` is odd, the program will print "Yes" because `m` can be 0 by adding `(n-1)/2` pairs and removing the last one.

- **Edge Case 2: `m = n`**
  - The program correctly prints "Yes".

- **Edge Case 3: `m = n - 2`**
  - The program might not cover this explicitly but the parity check should handle it correctly.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and considering various scenarios, it appears that the program correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description. There doesn't seem to be any scenario where the program fails to provide the correct output.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves by considering the parity of `m` and `n` and handling specific edge cases like `m == n` and `m == n - 1`.
