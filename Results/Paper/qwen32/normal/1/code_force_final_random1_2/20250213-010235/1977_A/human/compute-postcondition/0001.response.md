In this case, the loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1 because the `range(t)` function generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, the value of `t` already ensures that the loop can execute since it is within the specified range.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself because it is guaranteed to be within the valid range for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function and does not need to be set manually before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function**
