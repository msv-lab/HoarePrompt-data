Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is `i + 1` (Note: `i` is not explicitly initialized in the given state, so we assume it was previously defined somewhere else).
- `n` is the first integer read from the new input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the new input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('Yes')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Explanation:
- The value of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement outputs the literal string `'Yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
