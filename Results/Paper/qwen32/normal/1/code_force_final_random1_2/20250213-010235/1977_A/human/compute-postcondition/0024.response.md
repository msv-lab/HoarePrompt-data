The only variable in the loop head is `i`, as it is the only variable used in the `range(t)` function. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be modified based on the loop's iteration.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, then `n` equals `m`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `m`. If `m` is greater than `n`, then `m` remains greater than `n`. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` equals `n - 1`, then `m` retains the value `n - 1`. If `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, then either both `m` and `n` are even, or both are odd, or at least one of them is even.

Since `i` is the only variable that can be adjusted and it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, then `n` equals `m`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `m`. If `m` is greater than `n`, then `m` remains greater than `n`. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` equals `n - 1`, then `m` retains the value `n - 1`. If `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, then either both `m` and `n` are even, or both are odd, or at least one of them is even.**
