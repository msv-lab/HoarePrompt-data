### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of operations:
1. Add one cube to the tower.
2. Remove one cube from the tower.

Given `n` moves and a desired height `m`, we need to determine if it's possible to achieve a tower of height `m`.

#### Key Observations:
- If `n >= m`, it's possible to add `m` cubes one by one to reach the desired height `m`.
- If `n < m`, it's impossible because we cannot add more cubes than the number of moves available.
- Additionally, if `n` is even, we can achieve any even height `m` (by adding/removing pairs of cubes), and if `n` is odd, we can achieve any odd height `m`.

#### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the logic in the provided program:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It then checks several conditions:
  - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
  - If `m > n`, it prints "No".
  - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
  - If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
  - If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
  - Otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Evaluation of Conditions:
- The condition `if n == m:` is correct because if the number of moves equals the desired height, we can simply add one cube per move.
- The condition `elif m > n:` is correct because if the desired height is greater than the number of moves, it's impossible to achieve.
- The condition `elif m == n - 1:` is correct because if the desired height is one less than the number of moves, we can add `m` cubes and remove one, achieving the height `m`.
- The conditions `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` are also correct because they cover the cases where the parity (even/odd nature) of `n` and `m` match, which allows achieving the desired height.

#### Conclusion:
The program covers all necessary conditions to determine whether it's possible to achieve the desired height `m` with `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly handles all possible scenarios by checking the necessary conditions related to the number of moves and the desired height.
Correctness: **True**
