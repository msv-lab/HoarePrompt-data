### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic behind the conditions used in the program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- In each move, Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube.
- The initial number of cubes is zero.

#### Key Observations:
- If `n` is the number of moves, the final number of cubes `m` can be any integer between `-n` and `n` (inclusive), because each move can either add or subtract one cube.
- However, since the number of cubes cannot be negative, the feasible range for `m` is from `0` to `n`.
- To achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one subtraction) results in no net change, and any remaining moves must either all be additions or all be subtractions, which means the difference `n - m` must be even.

#### Analysis of the Program:
- The program checks several conditions:
  - `if n == m`: This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it means all moves were additions.
  - `elif m > n`: This is correct because if `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
  - `elif m == n - 1`: This is incorrect. Having `m == n - 1` does not guarantee that the number of moves is sufficient to achieve `m` cubes. For example, if `n = 3` and `m = 2`, it's possible (add, add, remove), but the condition `m == n - 1` alone does not cover all valid cases.
  - `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`: This is partially correct. If both `m` and `n` are even, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes, but it does not cover all valid cases.
  - `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`: This is also partially correct. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes, but it does not cover all valid cases.
  - `else: print('No')`: This is incorrect because it does not account for all valid cases where the difference `n - m` is even.

#### Correct Logic:
- The correct condition should be: `print('Yes')` if `0 <= m <= n` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`; otherwise, `print('No')`.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it incorrectly handles cases where `m` is less than `n` but the difference `n - m` is even.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
