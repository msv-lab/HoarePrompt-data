The code snippet provided only reads the first integer input which represents the number of test cases (t). It does not process any further inputs or modify any existing variables except for assigning the value of the first input to `t`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `t` now holds the value of the first input, while the precondition about the subsequent lines of input remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100.**
