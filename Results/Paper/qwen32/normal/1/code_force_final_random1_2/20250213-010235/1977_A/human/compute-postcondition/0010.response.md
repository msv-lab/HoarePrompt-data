Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, meaning it will iterate from 0 to \(t-1\).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input.
- It is specified that `n` is not equal to `m`, and `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- The current value of `m` is explicitly stated to be `n - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Given that the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, the output will always be the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
