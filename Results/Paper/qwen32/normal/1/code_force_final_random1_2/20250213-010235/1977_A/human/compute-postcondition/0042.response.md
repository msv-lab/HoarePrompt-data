Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is `i + 1`. However, there is no initial value provided for `i`, so we cannot determine its exact value. But this operation does not affect the print statement.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` do not influence the output of this specific print statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is simply the string `'Yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
