Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of operations:
1. Add 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove 1 cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
- If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes we can add is `n`.
- If `n` is equal to `m`, it's possible by adding one cube at a time.
- If `n` is greater than `m`, it's possible if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each pair of operations (add then remove or remove then add) results in no net change, and we can adjust the number of cubes by an even number.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the conditions in the program:

1. `if n == m:` 
   - This correctly handles the case where the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes.
   
2. `elif m > n:`
   - This correctly handles the case where the number of cubes desired is more than the number of moves available.
   
3. `elif m == n - 1:`
   - This condition is unnecessary and incorrect. If `m == n - 1`, it should still be possible if `n - m` is even, which it is since `n - m = 1` is odd. This condition can be removed or combined into the next ones.
   
4. `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:`
   - This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are even. However, this alone is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to reach `m` cubes from `n` moves.
   
5. `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:`
   - Similarly, this condition checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. Again, this alone is not sufficient.
   
6. `else:`
   - This handles all other cases, but due to the incorrect handling of even/odd differences, it might incorrectly return 'No' in some cases.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would be to check if `n - m` is non-negative and even, or if `n - m` is zero.

### Revised Conditions:
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, print 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases due to the unnecessary and incorrect conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
