The code reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, which does not affect the current code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input.**
