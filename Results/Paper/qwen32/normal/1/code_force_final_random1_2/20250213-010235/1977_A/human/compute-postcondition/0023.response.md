Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, then `n` equals `m`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `m`. If `m` is greater than `n`, then `m` remains greater than `n`. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` equals `n - 1`, then `m` retains the value `n - 1`. If `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, then either both `m` and `n` are even, or both are odd, or at least one of them is even.**
