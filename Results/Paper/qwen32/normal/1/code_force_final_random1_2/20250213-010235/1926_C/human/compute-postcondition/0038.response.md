The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable when its value is not used), and `t` which controls the number of iterations. Since `_` is not relevant to the state adjustments, we only need to consider `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, and the loop will execute `t` times. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be decremented by 1 in the context of the loop control, but since the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`, the actual value of `t` should remain the same while the loop counter `_` increments.

However, if we are looking at the state right before the start of the next iteration, the loop counter `_` would have just finished an iteration and is about to increment. Therefore, the state of `t` does not change, but conceptually, the loop counter `_` is about to increase by 1.

Since the task specifies adjusting the state based on the loop head variables, and `t` is the only relevant variable here, the state remains the same except for the implicit increment of the loop counter `_`.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to 200000. For `i > t`, `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum up to `pd[t]` plus the sum of the digits of numbers from `t+1` to `i`; `n` is an input integer.**
