The code snippet provided is `pd[i] += int(j)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`. Since `i` is 1, `pd[1]` would initially be 0 unless specified otherwise. The operation `pd[i] += int(j)` means that the current value of `pd[1]` (which is 0) will be updated by adding the integer value of `j` to it.

Since the value of `j` is not provided in the initial state, we can only express the new value of `pd[1]` in terms of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from `pd[1]` to `pd[i-1]` for each `i` from 2 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`, `i` is 1, `pd[1]` is `int(j)`**.
