To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for j in str(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop iterates over each character in the string representation of the variable `i`. Therefore, the key variable to consider here is `i`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is crucial because the loop will iterate over each character in `str(i)`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be such that `str(i)` results in a non-empty string.

2. **Other Variables:** The other variables (`t`, `N`, `pd`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Adjustment:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, we need to ensure that `i` has a value that, when converted to a string, results in a non-empty string. The smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition is 1.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is at least 1. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `pd`) do not need to be modified for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from `pd[1]` to `pd[i-1]` for each `i` from 2 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`, `i` is 1**
