To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is not equal to 0.

Given:
- `num` is an integer such that 0 ≤ num < 2 · 10^5 (after removing the last digit)
- `a` is the last digit of the original `num`

The loop condition is `while num != 0:`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must still be non-zero.

Since `num` has already had its last digit removed, we need to ensure that `num` is not zero after this removal. Therefore, before the last digit was removed, `num` must have been at least 10 (since removing the last digit from a single-digit number would result in 0).

Thus, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `num` should be a non-zero value after the last digit has been removed. This means `num` must have been at least 10 before the last digit was removed.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the state of `num` and `a` (and `a` is just the last digit of the original `num`), we need to ensure `num` is not zero after the last digit has been removed.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted such that `num` is a non-zero value.

State: **`num` is a non-zero integer such that 0 < num < 2 · 10^5 (after removing the last digit); `a` is the last digit of the original `num`**
