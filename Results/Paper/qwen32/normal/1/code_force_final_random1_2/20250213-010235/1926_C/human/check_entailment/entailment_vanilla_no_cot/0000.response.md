Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in its approach to solving the problem. The program calculates the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to 200,000 and stores it in an array `A`. For each test case, it simply retrieves the precomputed cumulative sum up to `n` from the array `A`. This approach works correctly for the first few test cases but will fail for larger values of `n` because the array `A` is not large enough to store cumulative sums up to `n = 2 * 10^5`.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. The array `A` is initialized to hold cumulative sums up to 200,000, which is fine, but the program does not handle cases where `n` exceeds 200,000. However, according to the problem statement, `n` can be as large as `2 * 10^5`, so the array should be able to handle this range.
   
2. The program calculates the cumulative sum for all numbers from 1 to 200,000, which is unnecessary and inefficient. It would be more efficient to calculate the sum of digit sums directly for each test case.

To fix the program, you should calculate the sum of digit sums directly for each test case without precomputing the cumulative sums for all possible values of `n`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num // 10)
    return a

for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += func_1(i)
    print(total_sum)
```

This version of the program calculates the sum of digit sums for each test case directly, ensuring that it works efficiently within the given constraints.
