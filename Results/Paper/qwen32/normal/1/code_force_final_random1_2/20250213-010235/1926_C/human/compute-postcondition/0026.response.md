The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `j` and how it progresses through the string representation of `i`.

Given:
- `i` is `t + 2`.
- `j` is currently processing the characters of `str(i)`.

Let's assume `j` has just processed one character of `str(i)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should move to the next character in `str(i)`.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Current State**: `j` has processed one character of `str(i)`.
2. **Next State**: `j` should point to the next character in `str(i)`.

Since `j` is iterating over each character in `str(i)`, the next value of `j` would be the next character in the string representation of `i`.

### Example:
If `i` is `123`, and `j` has just processed `'1'`, then in the next iteration, `j` should process `'2'`.

### General Case:
If `j` is currently processing the `k`-th character of `str(i)`, in the next iteration, `j` should process the `(k+1)`-th character of `str(i)`.

However, since we are only adjusting the state based on the loop head and we don't have the exact position of `j` within `str(i)`, we can infer that `j` should simply be the next character in the sequence as the loop progresses.

### Final State:
The state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for `t`, `N`, `pd`, and `i`. The only change is that `j` moves to the next character in `str(i)`.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i` for `i` from 1 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t` except `pd[t + 2]` which is now `pd[t + 2] + pd[t + 1] + int(j)`, `i` is `t + 2`, `j` is the next character in `str(i)`**
