Given the code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)`, we know that `i` is initially 1. Therefore, the operation modifies `pd[1]`. Initially, `pd[1]` is `2 * int(j)`. After the operation, `pd[1]` becomes `2 * int(j) + int(j)`, which simplifies to `3 * int(j)`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `N` remains 200001.
- `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[1]` is now `3 * int(j)` and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than 1.
- `i` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[1]` is `3 * int(j)` and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than 1, `i` is 1.**
