The given code modifies the variable `num` by performing an integer division by 10, effectively removing the last digit of the original `num`. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it holds the sum of the last two digits of the original `num`.

Given the initial state, `num` was a non-zero integer such that \(0 < \text{num} < 2 \cdot 10^5\) after removing its last digit. After executing the code, `num` will now be the original `num` divided by 10, and `a` will retain its original value.

Output State: **`num` is a non-zero integer such that \(0 < \text{num} < 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is the sum of the last two digits of the original `num`.**
