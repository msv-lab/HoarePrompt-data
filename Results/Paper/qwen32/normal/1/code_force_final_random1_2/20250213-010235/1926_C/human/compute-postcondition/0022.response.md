To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `N`. The variable `i` is the loop counter, and `N` is the upper limit of the loop.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i` for `i` from 1 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`, `i` is `t + 1`.
- Loop statement: `for i in range(1, N):`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `t + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `t + 2`. The value of `N` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i` for `i` from 1 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`, `i` is `t + 2`**
