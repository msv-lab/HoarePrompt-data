To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition specified in the loop head: `num != 0`.

Given:
- `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is 0.

The loop condition `num != 0` means that the loop will execute as long as `num` is not equal to 0. Since `num` is already specified to be within the range \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 2 \times 10^5\), it is guaranteed that `num` is not 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `num` to ensure the loop executes at least once.

The variable `a` is not part of the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state right before the loop does not need any modification to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is 0**
