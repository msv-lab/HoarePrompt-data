To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the provided loop:

```python
while num != 0:
    a = a + num % 10
    num = int(num / 10)
```

This loop essentially extracts each digit from the number `num` starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) and adds it to the variable `a`. The loop continues until all digits have been processed, i.e., `num` becomes 0.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `num` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive.
   - `a` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In each iteration, the last digit of `num` is added to `a`.
   - Then, `num` is updated to the integer part of `num` divided by 10, effectively removing the last digit.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `num` becomes 0, meaning all digits have been processed.

Given this behavior, the final value of `a` will be the sum of all the digits of the original `num`.

**Final Output State**:
- `num` will be 0 because all digits have been processed.
- `a` will be the sum of all the digits of the original `num`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **num is 0; a is the sum of all the digits of the original num.**
