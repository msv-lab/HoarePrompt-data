Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `N` is 200001.
- `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i` for `i` from 1 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t` except `pd[t + 2]` which is now `pd[t + 2] + pd[t + 1] + int(j)`.
- `i` is `t + 2`.
- `j` is the next character in `str(i)`.

Code Snippet:
```python
pd[i] += int(j)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The code increments `pd[i]` by the integer value of `j`.

Given `i` is `t + 2`, and `j` is the next character in `str(i)`, we need to determine the value of `j`. Since `i` is `t + 2`, `str(i)` will be the string representation of `t + 2`. The "next character" in this context is the first character of `str(t + 2)` because `j` is defined as the next character in `str(i)` and `i` is `t + 2`.

Therefore, `j` is the first digit of `t + 2`.

Let's denote the first digit of `t + 2` as `d`. Then, `pd[t + 2]` is incremented by `d`.

Output State:
- `t` remains an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `N` remains 200001.
- `pd` is updated such that `pd[t + 2]` is now `pd[t + 2] + d`, where `d` is the first digit of `t + 2`.
- `i` remains `t + 2`.
- `j` remains the next character in `str(i)`.

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd[t + 2]` is incremented by the first digit of `t + 2`, `i` is `t + 2`, and `j` is the first character of `str(t + 2)`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd[t + 2]` is `pd[t + 2] + int(str(t + 2)[0])`, `i` is `t + 2`, `j` is the first character of `str(t + 2)`**.
