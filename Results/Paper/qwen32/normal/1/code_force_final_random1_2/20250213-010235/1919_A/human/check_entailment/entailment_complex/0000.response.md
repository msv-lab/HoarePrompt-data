### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether the logic implemented in `func_1` aligns with the rules and winning conditions described in the problem statement.

The key aspect of the problem is determining the winner when both players play optimally. The optimal strategy revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins `(a + b)`.

#### Analysis:

1. **Total Coins Parity**:
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is **even**, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is **odd**, Alice wins.

This is because:
- When the total number of coins is even, Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves until the last coin, ensuring Bob makes the final move and thus losing.
- When the total number of coins is odd, Alice can force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of coins after her first move, leading to her victory.

#### Verification:

Let's verify the implementation in `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Bob'
    else :
        return 'Alice'
```
- This function correctly checks the parity of the total number of coins `(a + b)`.
- It returns `'Bob'` if the sum is even, and `'Alice'` if the sum is odd.

#### Testing with Examples:

Let's test the function with the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case**: `a = 1, b = 1`
   - Total coins: `1 + 1 = 2` (even)
   - Expected: `'Bob'`
   - Output: `'Bob'`

2. **Test Case**: `a = 1, b = 4`
   - Total coins: `1 + 4 = 5` (odd)
   - Expected: `'Alice'`
   - Output: `'Alice'`

3. **Test Case**: `a = 5, b = 3`
   - Total coins: `5 + 3 = 8` (even)
   - Expected: `'Bob'`
   - Output: `'Bob'`

4. **Test Case**: `a = 4, b = 5`
   - Total coins: `4 + 5 = 9` (odd)
   - Expected: `'Alice'`
   - Output: `'Alice'`

All test cases match the expected outcomes, confirming that the logic in `func_1` is correct.

### Conclusion:

Since `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the total number of coins, and `func_2` properly handles input and output for multiple test cases, the entire program is correct.

**Correctness:** **True**
