The code snippet reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
