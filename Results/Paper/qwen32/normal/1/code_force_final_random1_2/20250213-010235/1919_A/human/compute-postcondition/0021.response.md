Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, and all elements in `results` have been printed.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the program will have printed each element in the `results` list, which contains the outcomes of `func_1(a, b)` for each test case. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged as they were initially provided.
