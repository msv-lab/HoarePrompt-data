The code appends the value of `winner` to the `results` list. Given the initial state, `results` already contains one element which is the value of `winner`. After appending `winner` again, `results` will now contain two elements, both of which are the value of `winner`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 0, `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `winner`, `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)`**.
