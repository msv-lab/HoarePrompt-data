To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the effect of the line of code provided.

Initial State: 
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `results` is an empty list.

Code Snippet:
```python
winner = func_1(a, b)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The function `func_1` is called with arguments `a` and `b`.
- The result of `func_1(a, b)` is assigned to the variable `winner`.

Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `winner`. However, we know that `winner` will hold whatever value `func_1(a, b)` returns.

Variables that remain unchanged:
- `a` and `b` retain their initial values.
- `t` retains its initial value.
- `results` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)`.**
