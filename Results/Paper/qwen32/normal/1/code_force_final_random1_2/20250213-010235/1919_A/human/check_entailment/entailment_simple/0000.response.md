### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on whether the sum of the coins `(a + b)` is even or odd.

- If the sum of the coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins.
- If the sum of the coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins.

This is because when the total number of coins is even, Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves, ensuring that Bob makes the last move and thus wins. Conversely, when the total number of coins is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by making the first move.

The provided program correctly implements this logic in `func_1`. It checks if the sum of the coins is even or odd and returns "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly. The `func_2` function handles reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and printing the results.

Since the logic in `func_1` aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements and the rest of the program correctly manages input and output, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
