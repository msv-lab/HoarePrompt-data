Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `winner`, `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)`**

Explanation: The value of `winner` is updated to the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains two elements, both of which are the value of `winner`.
