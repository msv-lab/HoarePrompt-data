The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used just for iteration, it doesn't need to be adjusted in terms of its value. The loop continues as long as the range `t` allows it.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1 (since the loop iterates `t` times). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `winner`, `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
