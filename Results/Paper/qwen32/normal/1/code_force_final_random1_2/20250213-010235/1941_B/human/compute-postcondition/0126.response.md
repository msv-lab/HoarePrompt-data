Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be reduced to zeros by repeatedly subtracting specific values from consecutive elements. If the list can be reduced to zeros without encountering any negative values during the process, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
