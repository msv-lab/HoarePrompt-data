The code snippet `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` modifies the value of `a[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `opNum`. Given the initial state, `opNum` is 0, so `2 * opNum` equals 0. Therefore, `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers with `a[i]` equal to 0, `a[i + 1]` unchanged, `a[i + 2]` unchanged, `opNum` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `stop` is True if `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation, otherwise `stop` remains False**.
