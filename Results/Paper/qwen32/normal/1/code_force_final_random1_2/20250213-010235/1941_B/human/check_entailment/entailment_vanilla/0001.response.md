Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining whether we can reduce all elements of the array to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) and performing the following changes:
- Decrease `a[i-1]` by 1.
- Decrease `a[i]` by 2.
- Decrease `a[i+1]` by 1.

This operation can be applied any number of times to any valid index `i`.

### Provided Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:

#### Function 1: `func_1`
```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```
This function attempts to apply the specified operation to reduce the array elements to zero. However, there are issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**: Inside the `while` loop, the operation is incorrectly implemented. The current code subtracts `list[i-1]` times 1, 2, and 1 from `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` respectively. This is not the intended operation. Instead, it should subtract 1, 2, and 1 from these elements regardless of the value of `list[i-1]`.
   
   The correct operation should be:
   ```python
   list[i - 1] -= 1
   list[i] -= 2
   list[i + 1] -= 1
   ```

2. **Loop Condition**: The condition `list[i] > 1` is too restrictive. The operation can be performed as long as `list[i] >= 2` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.

### Conclusion

Due to the incorrect logic in `func_2`, the program does not correctly determine if it's possible to reduce all elements of the array to zero using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
