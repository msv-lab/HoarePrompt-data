The given Python code snippet contains only a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the initial state described. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `numTest`, `n`, `stop`, and the list `a`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the content within the `print` function.

Output: **YES**
