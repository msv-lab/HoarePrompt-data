Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `numTest` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i+1]` now equal to 0, `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `opNum` is `a[i+1]` (which is 0), `stop` is True, `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `numTest`, `n`, `a` (except `a[i+1]`), `a[i+2]`, `opNum`, and `stop` remain unchanged. The value of `a[i+1]` is 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
