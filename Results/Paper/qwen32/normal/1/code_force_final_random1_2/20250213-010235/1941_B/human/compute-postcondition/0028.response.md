Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers with `a[i]` equal to 0, `a[i + 1]` unchanged, `a[i + 2]` unchanged, `opNum` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `stop` is True if `a[i]` was less than 0, otherwise `stop` remains False.**
