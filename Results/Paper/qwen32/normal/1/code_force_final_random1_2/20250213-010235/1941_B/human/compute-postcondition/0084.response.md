The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. All other variables (`t`, `numTest`, `a[i]`, `a[n - 2]`, `a[n - 1]`, `stop`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is at least 1, `n` is the input integer, `a[i]` is 0 for all i from 0 to n - 3, `a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 1]` remain unchanged, `stop` remains unchanged**.
