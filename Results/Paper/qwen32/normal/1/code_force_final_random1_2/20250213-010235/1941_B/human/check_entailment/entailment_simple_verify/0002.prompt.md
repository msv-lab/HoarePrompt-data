You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of an array `a` zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`) and perform the following changes:
- Decrease `a[i-1]` by 1.
- Decrease `a[i]` by 2.
- Decrease `a[i+1]` by 1.

We need to check if we can apply this operation any number of times to make all elements of the array zero.

### Key Observations:
1. **Operation Constraints**: The operation can only be applied if `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` are sufficient to accommodate the decreases (i.e., they must be non-negative).
2. **Final State**: After applying the operations, all elements should be zero.
3. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach by iterating through the array and attempting to reduce the elements starting from the beginning.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided code:

```python
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        stop = False
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        if stop == True:
            continue
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Negative Values Check**: The program checks if `a[i] < 0` during the iteration, but this check is unnecessary because `a[i]` is initially non-negative, and we are reducing it by itself (`opNum = a[i]`). Therefore, `a[i]` will always be zero after the operation, and there's no way for it to become negative unless there's an overflow or incorrect logic elsewhere.
2. **Final Elements Check**: The program correctly checks if the last two elements (`a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`) are zero after processing the array. However, it doesn't ensure that the elements before the last two are also zero.
3. **Logic Flaw**: The core issue lies in how the program attempts to reduce the array. It greedily reduces the elements starting from the beginning, which might not be sufficient to make all elements zero. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program will reduce it to `[0, 0, 0, 1, 3]` and then fail because it cannot reduce the last two elements further without violating the operation constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. The greedy approach used in the program is insufficient to solve the problem for all possible inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
