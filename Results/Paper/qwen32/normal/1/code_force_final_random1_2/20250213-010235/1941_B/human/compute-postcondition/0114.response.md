The code snippet `a[i + 2] -= opNum` modifies the element at index `i + 2` of the list `a` by subtracting the value of `opNum`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4 and `opNum` is 0. Therefore, `a[i + 2]` refers to `a[6]`.

Since `opNum` is 0, subtracting `opNum` from `a[6]` does not change the value of `a[6]`. Thus, `a[6]` remains unchanged.

All other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `numTest` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[4]` is 0, `a[5]` is 0, and `a[6]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is 0; `stop` is False; `i` is 4.**
