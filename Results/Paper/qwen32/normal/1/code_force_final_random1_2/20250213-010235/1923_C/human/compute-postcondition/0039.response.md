To determine the output of the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, with `m` being non-negative.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a list constructed based on the cumulative sums of elements in `l` starting with 0.
- `c` is a list constructed based on the cumulative counts of 1s in `l` starting with 0.
- `i` is the difference between two elements in `c`: `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- `s` is the difference between two elements in `p`: `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- `m` is decremented by 1.
- `a` and `b` are updated to new values obtained from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The `print('YES')` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `s`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or their values. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
