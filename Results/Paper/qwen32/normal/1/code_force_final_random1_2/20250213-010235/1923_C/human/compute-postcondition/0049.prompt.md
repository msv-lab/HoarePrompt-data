Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is [0, i1, i1 + x2, ..., i1 + x2 + ... + xn], where in is the cumulative sum of the elements processed so far; `c` is [0, j1, j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0), ..., j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0) + ... + (1 if xn == 1 else 0)], where jn is the count of 1s encountered so far; `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is [0, i1, i1 + x2, ..., i1 + x2 + ... + xn]; `c` is [0, j1, j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0), ..., j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0) + ... + (1 if xn == 1 else 0)]; `i` is the count of 1s in the sublist of `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then the additional conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1 or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `m` must be greater than or equal to 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is [0, i1, i1 + x2, ..., i1 + x2 + ... + xn]; `c` is [0, j1, j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0), ..., j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0) + ... + (1 if xn == 1 else 0)]; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. `m` is decremented by 1; `a` and `b` are updated to the values obtained from the input. Regardless of whether `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is true or false, the same updates to `m`, `a`, and `b` occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is [0, i1, i1 + x2, ..., i1 + x2 + ... + xn]; `c` is [0, j1, j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0), ..., j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0) + ... + (1 if xn == 1 else 0)]; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, the conditions also remain as specified.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
