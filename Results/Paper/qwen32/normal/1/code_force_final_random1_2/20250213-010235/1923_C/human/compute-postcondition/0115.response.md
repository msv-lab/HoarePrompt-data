Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_next]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j]`; `i` is `x_next`; `j` is 2 if `x` is 1 and `x_next` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1.**
