Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 2 elements; `p` is [0, i]; `c` is [0, j]; `i` is `x`; `j` is 2 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` is 1; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` was initially 1 (which is the case if `x` did not equal 1), `j` becomes 2. If `j` was initially 2 (which would be the case if `x` equaled 1), `j` becomes 3, but since `j` is set to 1 only when `x` equals 1, the only relevant increment is from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
