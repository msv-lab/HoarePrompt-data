Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is [0, `i`, `i + x`]; `c` is [0, `j`, `j`]; `i` is `i + x`; `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains the same; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
