The value of `i` is incremented by the value of `x`. Since the initial value of `i` is 0, `i` will now be equal to `x`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is a list containing a single element `[0]`; `c` is a list containing a single element `[0]`; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains 0.**
