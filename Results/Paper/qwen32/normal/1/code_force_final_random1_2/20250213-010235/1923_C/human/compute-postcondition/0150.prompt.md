Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [0]
    c = [0]
    i, j = 0, 0
    for x in l:
        if x == 1:
            j += 1
        i += x
        p.append(i)
        c.append(j)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
        s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `m` is 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is [0, i1, i1 + x2, ..., i1 + x2 + ... + xn]; `c` is [0, j1, j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0), ..., j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0) + ... + (1 if xn == 1 else 0)]; `i` is the count of 1s in the sublist of `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1` from the last iteration; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration. The loop has completed all `m` iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` is now 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0; `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0; `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`. The loop has finished executing all `m` iterations, and no further changes are made to `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, or `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `m` must be greater than or equal to 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x1, x1+x2, ..., x1+x2+...+xn]` where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are the elements of `l`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j1, j2, ..., jn]` where `ji` is the cumulative count of 1s encountered up to the `i-th` element of `l`; `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`. The loop has executed `m` times, with each iteration processing a pair of integers `a` and `b` from the input, calculating `i = c[b] - c[a - 1]` and `s = p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and printing 'YES' if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, otherwise printing 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
