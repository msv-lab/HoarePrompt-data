Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is [0, `i`, `i + x`]; `c` is [0, `j`]; `i` is `i + x`; `j` is 1 if the previous `j` was 0 and `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains the same; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.** 

Explanation: The list `p` has been updated to include the new value of `i` which is `i + x`. All other variables retain their previous states or definitions.
