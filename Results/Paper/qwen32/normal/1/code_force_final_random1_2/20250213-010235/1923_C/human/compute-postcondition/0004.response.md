The code snippet `c = [0]` initializes a new list `c` with a single element `0`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, or `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing a single element `0`; `c` is a list containing a single element `0`.**
