The code snippet assigns two integers from the input to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x1, x1+x2, ..., x1+x2+...+xn]` where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are the elements of `l`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j1, j2, ..., jn]` where `ji` is the cumulative count of 1s encountered up to the `i-th` element of `l`; `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.**
