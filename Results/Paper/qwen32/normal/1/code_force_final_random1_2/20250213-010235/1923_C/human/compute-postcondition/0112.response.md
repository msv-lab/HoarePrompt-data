The code appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given that `j` is 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains 0, the list `c` will now contain two elements: the initial 0 and the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j]`; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains 0.**
