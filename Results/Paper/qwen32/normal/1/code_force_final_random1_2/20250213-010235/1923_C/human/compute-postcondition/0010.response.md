The code snippet provided increments the variable `i` by the value of `x`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `x`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `i` after the operation. However, we can express the new value of `i` in terms of its original value and `x`.

Given that `i` was initially 0, after executing `i += x`, the new value of `i` will be `x`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is a list containing a single element `0`; `c` is a list containing a single element `0`; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains 0.**
