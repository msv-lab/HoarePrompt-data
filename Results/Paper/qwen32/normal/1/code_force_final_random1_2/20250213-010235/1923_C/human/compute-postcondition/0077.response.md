The code snippet provided updates the values of `a` and `b` by reading two integers from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0; `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0; `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the current iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration.**
