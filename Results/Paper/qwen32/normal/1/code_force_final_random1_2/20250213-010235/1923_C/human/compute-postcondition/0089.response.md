To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the conditions under which this statement is executed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, with `m` being greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0.
- `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the current iteration.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `j` is the count of 1s in `l`.
- There is a conditional check: if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is executed if the conditions inside the if statement are met. Specifically, it checks:
1. `b - a + 1 > 1`: This ensures that the range from `a` to `b` includes more than one element.
2. `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`: Here, `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `l[a-1:b]`, and `i` is the count of 1s in the same sublist. The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` implies that the sum of the elements minus the number of elements in the sublist is at least the number of 1s in the sublist.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print "YES" if both conditions are satisfied. Given the initial state and the conditions, the output is straightforward:

Output: **YES**
