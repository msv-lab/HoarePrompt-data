Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `q`, where `n` is the length of a list `c` containing `n` positive integers, and `q` is the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing a range within the list `c`. The function processes these queries and returns the sum of the elements in the specified range `[l_i, r_i]` for each query.**
