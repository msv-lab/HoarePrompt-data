The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given that `i` is defined as `x + x`, the value of `i` is effectively `2 * x`. After appending, the list `p` will now include this new value.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 2 elements; `p` is [0, i, 2 * x]; `c` is [0, j]; `i` is `x` + `x`; `j` is 2 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` is 1; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**

In natural language, this means that the list `p` now includes an additional element which is twice the value of `x`. All other variables retain their previous values.
