The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Initially, `c` contains a single element `[0]`. After appending `j`, the list `c` will contain two elements: the original `0` and the value of `j`.

Given that `j` is `1` if `x` (which is also the value of `i`) is equal to `1`, and `0` otherwise, the new list `c` will be `[0, 1]` if `x` is `1`, or `[0, 0]` if `x` is not `1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is [0, `i`]; `c` is [0, `j`]; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` is 0.**
