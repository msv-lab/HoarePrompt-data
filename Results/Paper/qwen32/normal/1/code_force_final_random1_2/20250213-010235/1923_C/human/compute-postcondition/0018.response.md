The given code snippet appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. 

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` remain integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer.
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element.
- `p` remains [0, `i`, `i + x`].
- `c` originally was [0, `j`] and now becomes [0, `j`, `j`] because `j` is appended to `c`.
- `i` remains `i + x`.
- `j` remains 1 if the previous `j` was 0 and `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains the same.
- `x` remains the next element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is [0, `i`, `i + x`]; `c` is [0, `j`, `j`]; `i` is `i + x`; `j` is 1 if the previous `j` was 0 and `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains the same; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
