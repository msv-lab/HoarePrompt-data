Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least two elements; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_next, i]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j, j]`; `i` is `x_next + x`; if `x` is 1, then `j` is `j + 1`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
