The provided Python code snippet contains a single `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. The initial state and other variables described do not affect the content of this print statement because it explicitly specifies the string to be printed.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `j`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
