The given code snippet updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. Given the initial state, we need to determine the new value of `res[i]` and whether `mex` is updated.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the input integer
- `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged
- `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`

Code Snippet:
```python
res[i] = mex - ar[i]
```

Impact:
- The value of `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- There is no condition in the code snippet that checks if `mex > mex - ar[i]` before updating `res[i]`, so `res[i]` is directly set to `mex - ar[i]`.
- The value of `mex` is not updated in this snippet, only `res[i]` is modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `mex` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**

In natural language: The value of `res[i]` (where `i` is `len(ar) - 2`) is now `mex - ar[i]`. The value of `mex` and all other variables remain unchanged.
