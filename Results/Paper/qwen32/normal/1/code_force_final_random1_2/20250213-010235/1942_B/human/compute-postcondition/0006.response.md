The code assigns the value `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given that `mex` is initially set to `n`, and `ar[i]` is an element from the list `ar`, the value of `res[i]` will be `n - ar[i]`.

Here's the updated state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `ar` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element.
- `res` now has its `i`th element set to `n - ar[i]`.
- `mex` remains `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is `n - ar[i]`, `mex` is `n`.**
