Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise it remains `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, and `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`.**
