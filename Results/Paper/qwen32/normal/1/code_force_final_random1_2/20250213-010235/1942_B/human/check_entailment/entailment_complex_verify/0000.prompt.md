You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))

                mex = mex - ar[i]
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
        
    #State: Each line corresponds to the result list `res` for each test case, with each element separated by a space.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints a list `res` where each element is determined by subtracting the corresponding element in `a` from a decreasing maximum value `mex`, starting from `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Specifically, the calculation of the MEX value and the assignment of values to `res` are not correctly implemented.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the length of the array `a`.
2. It then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order.
3. For each element `ar[i]` in `a`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
4. It updates `mex` to the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.

However, this approach does not ensure that `res` will be a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
1
3
-2 1 2
```

The program would produce:
```
2 0 1
```

Let's verify this output:
- For `i=0`, `MEX([]) = 0`, and `a[0] = -2`, so `p[0]` should satisfy `0 - p[0] = -2`, which implies `p[0] = 2`. This is correct.
- For `i=1`, `MEX([2]) = 0`, and `a[1] = 1`, so `p[1]` should satisfy `0 - p[1] = 1`, which implies `p[1] = -1`. However, `-1` is not a valid value for `p` since `p` must contain integers from `0` to `n-1`. This is incorrect.
- For `i=2`, `MEX([2, -1])` is undefined because `-1` is not a valid value for `p`.

The correct output for this input should be `2 0 1` but the program does not guarantee that the values in `p` will always be within the range `[0, n-1]` and will form a valid permutation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
