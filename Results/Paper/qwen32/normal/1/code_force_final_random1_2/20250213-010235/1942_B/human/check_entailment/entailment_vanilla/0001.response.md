Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the given array `a`, where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Key Points:
1. **MEX Calculation**: We need to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
2. **Reconstruction Logic**:
   - If `a_i > 0`, then `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_{i-1})`.
   - If `a_i <= 0`, then `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_{i-1}) + a_i`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex`: This list is supposed to store the permutation `p` but is misleadingly named.
   - `minn`: Keeps track of the current MEX value.
   - `used`: A dictionary to keep track of which numbers have been used in the permutation.

2. **Loop through `arr`**:
   - If `arr[i] > 0`, the program correctly appends `minn` to `mex` and updates `used` and `minn`.
   - If `arr[i] <= 0`, the program calculates `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends this value to `mex`. However, this calculation is incorrect because `p_i` should be `MEX + a_i` directly, not `abs(MEX - a_i)`. The absolute value operation can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the values in `mex`, which is intended to be the permutation `p`.

### Error in the Program:
The critical error lies in how the program handles negative values in `arr`. Specifically, the use of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is incorrect. It should simply be `minn + arr[i]` when `arr[i] <= 0`.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect due to the misuse of the absolute value function when handling negative values in `arr`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
