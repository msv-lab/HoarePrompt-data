The code snippet modifies the `i`th element of the `res` list by setting it to `mex - ar[i]`. Given that `i` is defined as `x - 1`, the `i`th element of `res` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is now `mex - ar[i]` instead of `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `x - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the `i`th element of the `res` list has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
