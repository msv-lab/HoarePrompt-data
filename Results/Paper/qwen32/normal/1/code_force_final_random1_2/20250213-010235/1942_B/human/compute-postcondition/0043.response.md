The given code snippet initializes the `res` list with `None` values, but does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, or `mex`. Therefore, the only change is that `res` is now a list of `n` `None` values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` `None` values, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the calculations.**
