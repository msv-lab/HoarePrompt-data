In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` (which is a common Python convention for a throwaway variable) and the result of `int(input())`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1 since the loop will iterate `t` times. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and their properties) are defined within the loop body and thus do not need to be adjusted in the initial state before the loop starts.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once, as required by the problem statement.
