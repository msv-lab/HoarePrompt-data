The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `ar`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, and `mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the corresponding iteration, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the calculations.**

In simpler terms, `ar` now holds the list of integers read from the input, while `t`, `n`, `res`, and `mex` retain their initial values.
