The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`. Given that `i` is currently `len(ar) - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be decremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(ar) - 2`.
- The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(ar) - 3`.

No other variables in the loop head (`ar` and `n`) need to be adjusted as they are not modified within the loop head itself.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `res[len(ar) - 2]`. `i` is `len(ar) - 3`**
