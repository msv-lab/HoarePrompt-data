The code snippet provided initializes the list `res` with `None` values, but does not affect the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `mex`). The `res` list is now a list of length `n` where each element is `None`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `None`; `mex` is the minimum value encountered during the loop.**
