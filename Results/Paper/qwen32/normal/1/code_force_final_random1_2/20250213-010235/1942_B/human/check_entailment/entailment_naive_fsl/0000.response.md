Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Specifically, the calculation of the MEX value and the assignment of values to `res` are not correctly implemented.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the length of the array `a`.
2. It then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order.
3. For each element `ar[i]` in `a`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
4. It updates `mex` to the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.

However, this approach does not ensure that `res` will be a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
1
3
-2 1 2
```

The program would produce:
```
2 0 1
```

Let's verify this output:
- For `i=0`, `MEX([]) = 0`, and `a[0] = -2`, so `p[0]` should satisfy `0 - p[0] = -2`, which implies `p[0] = 2`. This is correct.
- For `i=1`, `MEX([2]) = 0`, and `a[1] = 1`, so `p[1]` should satisfy `0 - p[1] = 1`, which implies `p[1] = -1`. However, `-1` is not a valid value for `p` since `p` must contain integers from `0` to `n-1`. This is incorrect.
- For `i=2`, `MEX([2, -1])` is undefined because `-1` is not a valid value for `p`.

The correct output for this input should be `2 0 1` but the program does not guarantee that the values in `p` will always be within the range `[0, n-1]` and will form a valid permutation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
