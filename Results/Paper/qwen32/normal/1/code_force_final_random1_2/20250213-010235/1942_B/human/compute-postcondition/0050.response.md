The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged, and `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`** (assuming `i` was `len(ar) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration).

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged, and `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, `i` is decremented by 1**.

If we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged, and `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `k - 1`**

Since we don't have the specific value of `k`, we can say:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged, and `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, `i` is decremented by 1**.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `i` was `len(ar) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged, and `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**

So the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged, and `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, `i` is decremented by 1**. 

If we assume `i` was `len(ar) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged, and `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**

Thus, the most accurate general form is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged, and `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, `i` is decremented by 1**.

If `i` was `len(ar) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged, and `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**

So the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged, and `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**.
