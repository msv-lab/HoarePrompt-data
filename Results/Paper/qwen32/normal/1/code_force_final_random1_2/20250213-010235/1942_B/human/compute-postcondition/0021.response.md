The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. None of the other variables (`t`, `ar`, `res`, `mex`) are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where each `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the loop, with `mex` being updated during the loop; `mex` is the minimum value encountered during the loop**. 

In simpler terms, `n` now holds the value of the input integer, while all other variables remain unchanged.
