Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged, and `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`.**
