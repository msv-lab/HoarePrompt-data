Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
- `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.
- If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `res[len(ar) - 2]`.
- `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
res[i] = mex - ar[i]
```

### Impact Analysis:
- The value of `res[i]` is being set to `mex - ar[i]`.
- No other variables are modified directly by this line of code.

### Output State Calculation:
- The value of `res[i]` changes to `mex - ar[i]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `mex`, `res[len(ar) - 2]`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is updated if `mex > mex - ar[i]` to `res[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.**
