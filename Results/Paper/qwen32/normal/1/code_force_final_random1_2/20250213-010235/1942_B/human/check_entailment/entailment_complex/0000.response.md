### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`. This is because initially, the MEX of an empty set (or a set containing no numbers yet) is `n`.
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values with length `n`.

2. **Loop through `ar` in reverse order**:
   - For each element `ar[i]` in the array `ar` starting from the last element to the first:
     - `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`. This is because, according to the problem statement, `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, so `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.
     - After setting `res[i]`, the code checks if the current `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`. If it is, it updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`. This step ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res`.

3. **Printing the result**:
   - After processing all elements of `ar` for a particular test case, the program prints the resulting permutation `res`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases.

#### First Test Case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
- Calculation:
  - `i = 4`: `res[4] = mex - ar[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
  - `i = 3`: `res[3] = mex - ar[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
  - `i = 2`: `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 2` (no change since `mex` is already less than `2 + 2`)
  - `i = 1`: `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
  - `i = 0`: `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
- Output: `res = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

#### Second Test Case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `ar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
- Calculation:
  - `i = 4`: `res[4] = mex - ar[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = 4`
  - `i = 3`: `res[3] = mex - ar[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3`
  - `i = 2`: `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
  - `i = 1`: `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
  - `i = 0`: `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
- Output: `res = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

#### Third Test Case:
- Input: `n = 3`, `ar = [-2, 1, 2]`
- Calculation:
  - `i = 2`: `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = 1`
  - `i = 1`: `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
  - `i = 0`: `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = 0` (no change since `mex` is already less than `0 + 2`)
- Output: `res = [2, 0, 1]`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a` and the definition of MEX. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
