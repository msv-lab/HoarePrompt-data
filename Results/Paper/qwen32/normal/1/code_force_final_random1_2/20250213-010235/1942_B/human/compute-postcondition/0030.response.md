The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `len(ar) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `n - ar[i]` and other elements are `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`.**
