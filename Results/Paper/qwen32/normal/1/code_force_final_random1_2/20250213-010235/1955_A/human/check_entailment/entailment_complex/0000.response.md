### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to ensure it correctly computes the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given the prices `a` and `b`.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion).

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - If `2*a < b`, it means buying two yogurts separately is cheaper than buying them under promotion. Therefore, the total cost is simply `n * a`.
   - If `n` is even and `2*a >= b`, it is cheaper or equally expensive to buy yogurts in pairs under promotion. Hence, the total cost is `(n/2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd and `2*a >= b`, the optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible under promotion and then buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price. Thus, the total cost is `((n-1)/2) * b + a`.

However, there is a mistake in the code:
- The code uses `A`, `B`, and `C` instead of `n`, `a`, and `b`. This is not a logical error but a naming inconsistency.
- The condition `if B * 2 < C` should be `if a * 2 < b` to correctly compare the cost of buying two yogurts separately versus under promotion.
- The condition `elif A % 2 == 0` should be `else` because if `2*a < b` is false, we don't need to check if `n` is even; we just need to handle the odd case separately.
- The calculation `X = A // 2` and `print(X * C + B)` should use `a` and `b` instead of `C` and `B`.

Here is the corrected version of the logic:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a * 2 < b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            pairs = n // 2
            remainder = n % 2
            print(pairs * b + remainder * a)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Given the original code's logic, despite the variable naming issue, the core logic seems to be correct except for the condition checks and variable usage. However, since the variable names do not match the problem statement, the original code would not work as intended.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original code has variable naming issues that would prevent it from working correctly as per the problem statement. The logic itself is almost correct but needs to be adjusted for proper variable names and conditions.
