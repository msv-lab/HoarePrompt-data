To determine what will be printed by the `print(A * B)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the given information:

- `A`, `B`, and `C` are positive integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the calculation of `A * B` since `i` is not used in the print statement.

Given these conditions, the print statement will output the product of `A` and `B`.

Since the specific values of `A` and `B` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result. However, we know that the output will be the product of these two positive integers.

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **A * B (where A and B are positive integers read from the input)**
