Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective:** Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts.
- **Prices:**
  - Single yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts together cost `b` burles.

### Provided Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Conditions in the Code:
1. **Condition 1:** If `2 * B < C`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
2. **Condition 2:** If `A` is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, so the total cost is `(A * C) / 2`.
3. **Condition 3:** If `A` is odd, buy as many pairs as possible (`A // 2` pairs) and pay `C` for each pair. Then, buy the remaining yogurt individually at price `B`. Thus, the total cost is `(A // 2) * C + B`.

### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the code against the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:** `2 5 9`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so buy 2 yogurts with the promotion.
   - Cost: `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:** `3 5 9`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so buy 2 yogurts with the promotion and 1 yogurt individually.
   - Cost: `9 + 5 = 14`.

3. **Test Case 3:** `3 5 11`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so buy all 3 yogurts individually.
   - **Incorrect**: The code will buy 1 pair and 1 yogurt individually, resulting in `11 + 5 = 16`. However, buying all 3 yogurts individually would be cheaper at `3 * 5 = 15`.

4. **Test Case 4:** `4 5 11`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so buy all 4 yogurts individually.
   - **Incorrect**: The code will buy 2 pairs, resulting in `2 * 11 = 22`. However, buying all 4 yogurts individually would be cheaper at `4 * 5 = 20`.

### Correct Logic:
- **Condition 1:** If `2 * B <= C`, buy all yogurts individually.
- **Condition 2:** If `2 * B > C`, buy as many pairs as possible and handle the remaining yogurt if `A` is odd.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 <= C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            pairs = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(pairs * C + remaining * B)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where buying individual yogurts is cheaper than the promotion correctly, especially when `A` is odd.

**Final:** **False**
