To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed:

### Initial State:
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are positive integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement, so this detail is irrelevant for the current task).
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2` (integer division of `A` by 2).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Calculate `X`:** 
   - `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer part of `A` divided by 2.
   
2. **Expression `X * C + B`:**
   - First, multiply `X` by `C`.
   - Then, add `B` to the result of the multiplication.

### Final Output:
The expression `X * C + B` will be evaluated using the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`. Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are positive integers read from the input)**
