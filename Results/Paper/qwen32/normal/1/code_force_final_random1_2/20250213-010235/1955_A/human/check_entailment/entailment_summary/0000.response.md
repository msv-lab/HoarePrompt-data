### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the program step-by-step to see if it correctly computes the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given promotion rules.

1. **Understanding the Promotion Rules:**
   - Regular price for one yogurt: `a` burles.
   - Promotion price for two yogurts: `b` burles.
   
2. **Program Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts).
   - It then determines the minimum cost using the following logic:
     - If the regular price for two yogurts (`a * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
     - If `n` is even, the best option is to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, resulting in a total cost of `(n / 2) * b`.
     - If `n` is odd, the best strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible and then buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price. This results in a total cost of `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

3. **Verification Against Example Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `n=2`, `a=5`, `b=9`
     - Since `a * 2 = 10 > b = 9`, it's better to buy two yogurts at the promotion price.
     - Expected cost: `9` burles.
     - Program output: `9` burles.
   - **Test Case 2:** `n=3`, `a=5`, `b=9`
     - Since `a * 2 = 10 > b = 9`, it's better to buy two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price.
     - Expected cost: `9 + 5 = 14` burles.
     - Program output: `14` burles.
   - **Test Case 3:** `n=3`, `a=5`, `b=11`
     - Since `a * 2 = 10 < b = 11`, it's better to buy each yogurt individually.
     - Expected cost: `3 * 5 = 15` burles.
     - Program output: `15` burles.
   - **Test Case 4:** `n=4`, `a=5`, `b=11`
     - Since `a * 2 = 10 < b = 11`, it's better to buy each yogurt individually.
     - Expected cost: `4 * 5 = 20` burles.
     - Program output: `20` burles.

From the above analysis, we can see that the program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case according to the given rules.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts considering the promotion rules.

**Correctness: True**
