### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective:** Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts.
- **Prices:**
  - Single yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts together cost `b` burles.
- **Approach:**
  - If buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotion (`b`), then buy all yogurts individually.
  - Otherwise, buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible using the promotion.
  - If there is an odd number of yogurts, buy the remaining one individually.

#### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the code logic:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

1. **Loop through Test Cases:**
   - The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Read Input Values:**
   - For each test case, read `A` (number of yogurts), `B` (price of one yogurt), and `C` (price of two yogurts).

3. **Determine Minimum Cost:**
   - **Condition 1:** If `2 * B < C`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
     - This condition is correct because if the individual price for two yogurts is cheaper than the promotion price, it's better to buy them individually.
   - **Condition 2:** If `A` is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, so the total cost is `(A * C) / 2`.
     - This condition is correct because if the number of yogurts is even, we can always buy them in pairs.
   - **Condition 3:** If `A` is odd, buy as many pairs as possible (`A // 2` pairs) and pay `C` for each pair. Then, buy the remaining yogurt individually at price `B`. Thus, the total cost is `(A // 2) * C + B`.
     - This condition is also correct because if the number of yogurts is odd, we buy as many pairs as possible and then buy the remaining yogurt individually.

#### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the code against the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:** `2 5 9`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so buy 2 yogurts with the promotion.
   - Cost: `9`.
   - The program prints `9`, which is correct.

2. **Test Case 2:** `3 5 9`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so buy 2 yogurts with the promotion and 1 yogurt individually.
   - Cost: `9 + 5 = 14`.
   - The program prints `14`, which is correct.

3. **Test Case 3:** `3 5 11`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so buy all 3 yogurts individually.
   - Cost: `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - The program prints `15`, which is correct.

4. **Test Case 4:** `4 5 11`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so buy all 4 yogurts individually.
   - Cost: `4 * 5 = 20`.
   - The program prints `20`, which is correct.

#### Annotations:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points and match the logic described in the program analysis.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices and conditions.

**Correctness:** **True**

Final: **True**
