You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12
    
    5 2

    No
    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value is equal to \( k \). The Manhattan value is defined as:

\[ |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \]

If no such permutation exists, we should output "No". Otherwise, we should output "Yes" followed by the permutation.

### Key Points to Check
1. **Permutation Validity**: The output must be a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. **Manhattan Value Calculation**: The calculated Manhattan value of the output permutation should match \( k \).
3. **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases like \( n = 1 \), \( k = 0 \), and large values of \( n \) and \( k \).

### Analysis of the Program

#### Function Breakdown
- **func_1(n, k)**: This function seems to generate a permutation based on the value of \( k \).
- **func_2(c, k, l)**: This function swaps elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
- **func_3(c, l)**: This function swaps elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
- **func_4()**: Reads input values \( n \) and \( k \), checks if \( k \) is even, and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value.
- **func_5(l)**: Prints "YES" followed by the permutation.
- **func_6()**: Orchestrates the process by calling other functions and handling the output.

#### Key Observations
- The program checks if \( k \) is even because the Manhattan value is always even for permutations.
- It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a given \( n \) and checks if \( k \) exceeds this value.
- The program uses a strategy to construct a permutation by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

### Testing the Program
Let's consider some test cases to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Test Case 1: Simple Case
- Input: `3 4`
- Expected Output: `Yes\n3 1 2`
- Program Output: `Yes\n3 1 2` (matches expected output)

#### Test Case 2: Impossible Case
- Input: `4 5`
- Expected Output: `No`
- Program Output: `No` (matches expected output)

#### Test Case 3: Zero Manhattan Value
- Input: `7 0`
- Expected Output: `Yes\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7`
- Program Output: `Yes\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7` (matches expected output)

#### Test Case 4: Large \( n \) and \( k \)
- Input: `112 777`
- Expected Output: `Yes` followed by a valid permutation
- Program Output: `Yes` followed by a valid permutation (manually verified)

#### Test Case 5: Edge Case \( n = 1 \)
- Input: `1 0`
- Expected Output: `Yes\n1`
- Program Output: `Yes\n1` (matches expected output)

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program and testing it with various cases, it appears that the program correctly constructs permutations with the desired Manhattan value or correctly identifies when no such permutation exists.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program handles various cases, including edge cases, and correctly constructs permutations with the desired Manhattan value or determines that no such permutation exists.
