Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0; `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice; `c` is 3; `i` is 1. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(3, k, l)`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything and continues with the rest of the code.**
