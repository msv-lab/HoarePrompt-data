Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input. If either `n` or `k` does not meet the specified constraints, it returns `(0, 0)`. If `k` is not an even integer, it returns `0, 0`. Otherwise, it returns the tuple `(n, k)` where `n` is the first integer read from the input and `k` is the second even integer read from the input.**
