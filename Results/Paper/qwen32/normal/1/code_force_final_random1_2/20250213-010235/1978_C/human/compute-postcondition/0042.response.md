Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k`, a non-negative integer. It returns a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` based on the value of `k`. The returned list `l` can either be a simple list of integers from 1 to `n`, or it can have the integer `n` moved to the front or inserted at a specific position determined by `k`.**
