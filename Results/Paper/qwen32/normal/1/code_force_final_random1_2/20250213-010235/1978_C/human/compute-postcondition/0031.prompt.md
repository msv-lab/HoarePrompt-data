You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12).
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        l = func_3(c, l)
        
    #State: `c` is the total number of iterations completed, `k` is `0` or less than `i - 1` for the last iteration, and `l` is the list after being modified by `func_3` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, and `k`, a non-negative integer up to 1 trillion inclusive. Depending on the value of `k`, the function performs different operations on a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is 0, it returns the list `l`. If `k` is not 0, it proceeds through a series of cases involving modifications to `l` using `func_3` and computations using `func_2`. Specifically, Case 1 returns `l` directly if `k` is 0. Case 2 applies `func_2` with arguments 1 and `k` to the list `l`. Case 3 modifies `l` once with `func_3` using argument 2. Case 4 applies `func_2` with arguments 2 and `k` to the modified list `l`. Case 5 modifies `l` twice with `func_3` using argument 2. Case 6 applies `func_2` with argument 3 and `k` to the list `l`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`.

Case_2: The program returns the result of `func_2(1, k, l)`, where `k` is a non-negative integer not equal to 0, and `l` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`.

Case_3: The program returns the list `l` which has been modified by `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2.

Case_4: The program returns the result of `func_2(2, k, l)`, where `k` is a non-zero non-negative integer and `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)`

Case_5: The program returns the list `l` which has been modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice.

Case_6: The program returns the result of `func_2(3, k, l)`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
