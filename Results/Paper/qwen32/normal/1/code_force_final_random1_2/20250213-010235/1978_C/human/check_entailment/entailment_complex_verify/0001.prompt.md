You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the logic and functionality of each function and how they interact.

### Function Analysis:

1. **func_1(n, k):**
   - This function aims to construct a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It starts with a sorted list `l` from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates backward through the list, swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value.
   - The loop condition `for i in range(n, -1, -2)` suggests it's trying to maximize the Manhattan value by swapping pairs of elements.
   - The function calls `func_2` and `func_3` to perform specific swaps based on the value of `k`.

2. **func_2(c, k, l):**
   - This function performs a swap between two specific elements in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - It swaps the element at index `-c` with the element at index `-c - k`.

3. **func_3(c, l):**
   - This function swaps the element at index `-c` with the element at index `c - 1`.
   - This swap is used to incrementally adjust the Manhattan value.

4. **func_4():**
   - This function reads input values `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is odd, returning `(0, 0)` if true because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`.
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

5. **func_5(l):**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l` if a valid permutation is found.

6. **func_6():**
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is zero (indicating an invalid case), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_5` to print it.

### Key Points to Consider:

- **Even Manhattan Value:** The program correctly identifies that the Manhattan value must be even, as it checks `k % 2`.
- **Maximum Possible Manhattan Value:** The calculation of `max_k` seems correct, ensuring that `k` does not exceed the maximum achievable Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
- **Constructing Permutations:** The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` attempts to construct permutations by strategically swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. However, the exact correctness of these functions in terms of always producing a valid permutation for any valid `k` is non-trivial and requires deeper analysis.

### Potential Issues:

- **Complexity and Edge Cases:** The algorithm's complexity and handling of edge cases (e.g., very small or large `n` and `k`) need thorough verification.
- **Correctness of Swapping Logic:** The swapping logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` must be rigorously tested to ensure it always produces a valid permutation with the correct Manhattan value.

### Conclusion:

Given the complexity of the problem and the detailed nature of the solution, while the program appears to handle many cases correctly, it is challenging to conclusively verify its correctness without extensive testing and possibly a more formal proof of the swapping logic.

However, based on the provided code and the problem constraints, the program seems to follow a logical approach to solve the problem. Therefore, we can reasonably assume it works for the intended use cases.

Correctness: **True** (assuming the swapping logic is correct and thoroughly tested)
