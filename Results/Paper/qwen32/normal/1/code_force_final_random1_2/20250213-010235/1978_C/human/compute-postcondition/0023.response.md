To determine the output state, we need to focus on the variable `l`. The description states that `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice. However, since the function `func_3` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact modifications made to `l`. Therefore, we can only describe `l` as being modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice.

Given the lack of details about `func_3`, the best we can do is to state that `l` has undergone two modifications by `func_3` with the argument `2`.

Output State: **The program returns the list `l` which has been modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice.**
