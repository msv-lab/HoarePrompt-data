Functionality: **The function takes a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is distinct and in the range from 1 to `n`. It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` in their original order, separated by spaces, and then prints a newline. The function returns `None`.**
