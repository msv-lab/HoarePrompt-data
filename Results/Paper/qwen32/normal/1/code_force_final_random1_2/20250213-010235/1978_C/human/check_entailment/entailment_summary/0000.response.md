### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify that it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value of a permutation `p` is defined as the sum of absolute differences between each element and its index position.

2. **Constraints and Observations:**
   - The Manhattan value must be even because each swap operation (used in `func_1`) changes the Manhattan value by an even number.
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is `(n^2 - 1) / 2` if `n` is odd, and `n^2 / 2` if `n` is even.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_4`:** This function checks if `k` is even and if it is within the bounds of the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given `n`. If not, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - **`func_1`:** This function constructs a permutation with the required Manhattan value `k`. It uses `func_2` and `func_3` to perform swaps on the list.
     - **`func_2`:** Swaps elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
     - **`func_3`:** Swaps the c-th element with the c-th last element in the list.
   - **`func_5`:** Prints the permutation if a valid one is found.
   - **`func_6`:** Orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to validate inputs, `func_1` to generate the permutation, and `func_5` to print the result.

4. **Verification:**
   - **Even `k`:** The function correctly handles the case when `k` is even and within the permissible range.
   - **Odd `k`:** If `k` is odd, the function correctly identifies this and outputs "NO".
   - **Maximum `k`:** The function ensures that `k` does not exceed the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given `n`.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to find a permutation with the required Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
