To determine the output state, we need to focus on the function call `func_2(c, k, l)` and the given initial state.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0
- `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice
- `c` is 3
- `i` is 1

The code snippet provided is:
```python
return func_2(c, k, l)
```

Since the functions `func_2` and `func_3` are not defined in the given context, we cannot execute them directly. However, we can infer that the return statement will output whatever `func_2(c, k, l)` returns. Given the values of `c`, `k`, and `l`, the output state will depend on the behavior of `func_2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **The program returns the result of `func_2(3, k, l)`**, where `k` is a non-negative integer not equal to 0, and `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice.
