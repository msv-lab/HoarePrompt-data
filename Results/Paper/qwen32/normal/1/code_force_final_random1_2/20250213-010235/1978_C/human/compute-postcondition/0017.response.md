To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the code snippet:

- `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 2 Â· 10^5.
- `k` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 10^12, but it is explicitly stated that `k` is not equal to 0 and is adjusted to `k - i + 1`. Given `i` is 1, `k` remains `k`.
- `l` is a list that has been modified by the function `func_3(c, l)` with `c` being 2.
- `c` is 2.
- `i` is 1.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
return func_2(c, k, l)
```

This means the program will return the result of the function `func_2` called with the arguments `c`, `k`, and `l`.

Given the information, we know:
- `c` is 2.
- `k` is a non-zero non-negative integer.
- `l` is a list that has been modified by `func_3(2, l)`.

Since we do not have the definitions of `func_2` and `func_3`, we cannot compute the exact output of `func_2(c, k, l)`. However, we can describe the output state based on the given information.

Output State: **The program returns the result of `func_2(2, k, l)`, where `k` is a non-zero non-negative integer and `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)`**.
