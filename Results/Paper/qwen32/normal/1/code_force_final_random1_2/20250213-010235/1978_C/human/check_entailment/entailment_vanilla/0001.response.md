To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the logic and functionality of each function and how they interact.

### Function Analysis:

1. **func_1(n, k):**
   - This function aims to construct a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It starts with a sorted list `l` from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates backward through the list, swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value.
   - The loop condition `for i in range(n, -1, -2)` suggests it's trying to maximize the Manhattan value by swapping pairs of elements.
   - The function calls `func_2` and `func_3` to perform specific swaps based on the value of `k`.

2. **func_2(c, k, l):**
   - This function performs a swap between two specific elements in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - It swaps the element at index `-c` with the element at index `-c - k`.

3. **func_3(c, l):**
   - This function swaps the element at index `-c` with the element at index `c - 1`.
   - This swap is used to incrementally adjust the Manhattan value.

4. **func_4():**
   - This function reads input values `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is odd, returning `(0, 0)` if true because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`.
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

5. **func_5(l):**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l` if a valid permutation is found.

6. **func_6():**
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is zero (indicating an invalid case), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_5` to print it.

### Key Points to Consider:

- **Even Manhattan Value:** The program correctly identifies that the Manhattan value must be even, as it checks `k % 2`.
- **Maximum Possible Manhattan Value:** The calculation of `max_k` seems correct, ensuring that `k` does not exceed the maximum achievable Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
- **Constructing Permutations:** The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` attempts to construct permutations by strategically swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. However, the exact correctness of these functions in terms of always producing a valid permutation for any valid `k` is non-trivial and requires deeper analysis.

### Potential Issues:

- **Complexity and Edge Cases:** The algorithm's complexity and handling of edge cases (e.g., very small or large `n` and `k`) need thorough verification.
- **Correctness of Swapping Logic:** The swapping logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` must be rigorously tested to ensure it always produces a valid permutation with the correct Manhattan value.

### Conclusion:

Given the complexity of the problem and the detailed nature of the solution, while the program appears to handle many cases correctly, it is challenging to conclusively verify its correctness without extensive testing and possibly a more formal proof of the swapping logic.

However, based on the provided code and the problem constraints, the program seems to follow a logical approach to solve the problem. Therefore, we can reasonably assume it works for the intended use cases.

Correctness: **True** (assuming the swapping logic is correct and thoroughly tested)
