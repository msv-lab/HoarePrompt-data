The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`) and `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i_end + 1`.

Since the loop head does not involve `n`, `l`, or `lis`, these variables do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, `test` remains `True` and `lis` has either an odd or even number of elements; `i` is `i_end + 1`**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_end`, we can generalize it as follows:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, `test` remains `True` and `lis` has either an odd or even number of elements; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
