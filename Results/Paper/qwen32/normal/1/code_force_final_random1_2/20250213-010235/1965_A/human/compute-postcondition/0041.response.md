Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, `test` remains `True` and `lis` has either an odd or even number of elements.**
