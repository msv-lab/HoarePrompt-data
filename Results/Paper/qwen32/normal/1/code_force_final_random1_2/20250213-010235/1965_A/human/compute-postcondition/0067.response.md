Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and their implications:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is another input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, or `j`.

Therefore, the output is simply the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
