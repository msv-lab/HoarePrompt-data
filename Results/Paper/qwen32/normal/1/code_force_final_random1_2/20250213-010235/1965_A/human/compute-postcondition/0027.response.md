To determine the output state, we need to consider the conditions given in the initial state and how they affect the return statement.

Given:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, starting with 1, followed by unique integers representing the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile.
- `not_c` is a boolean variable.
- If `not_c` is `True`, then `A` is `True` and `not_c` remains `True`.
- If `not_c` is `False`, then `A` is `False` and `not_c` remains `False`.

The return statement is:
```python
return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
```

Based on the conditions:
- If `not_c` is `True`, `A` is `True`, and the function returns `'Alice'`.
- If `not_c` is `False`, `A` is `False`, and the function returns `'Bob'`.

Therefore, the output depends solely on the value of `not_c`.

Output State: **The program returns 'Alice' if not_c is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.**
