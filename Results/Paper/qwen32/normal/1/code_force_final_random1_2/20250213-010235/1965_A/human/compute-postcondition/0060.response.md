Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is another input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `test` is `False` if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, otherwise `test` remains `True`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Alice'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement that depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `test`, or `j`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
