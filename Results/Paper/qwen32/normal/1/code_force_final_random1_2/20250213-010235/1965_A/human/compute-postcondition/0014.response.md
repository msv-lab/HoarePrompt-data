The code sets `not_c` to `False`. This change affects only the variable `not_c`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; `i` is `i + 1`; `A` is True; `not_c` is False.**
