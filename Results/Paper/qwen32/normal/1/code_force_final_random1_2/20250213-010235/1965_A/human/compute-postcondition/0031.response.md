Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` containing the integer 1 and having a length greater than 1, `j` is 3, `test` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
