Output State: **arr is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element t is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles n and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; A is True; not_c is True; the current value of not_c is True.**

Explanation: The variable `A` was initially `False`. After executing `A = not A`, `A` becomes `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.
