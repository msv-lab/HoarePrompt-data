To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `j` and the implicit length of `lis`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `test` is `False` if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, otherwise `test` remains `True`.
- `j` is either an odd number or an even number. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we know that `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than the length of `lis`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Value of `j`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 again.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution:** The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < len(lis)`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we need to ensure that the new value of `j` is still less than `len(lis)`.

### Adjustments:
- **Increment `j`:** Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1 from its current value.
- **Check Length of `lis`:** Ensure that `j` is still less than `len(lis)` for the loop to execute again.

### Example Adjustment:
If `j` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 4. We need to ensure that `4 < len(lis)` for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `test` is `False` if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, otherwise `test` remains `True`, `j` is incremented by 1 (so if `j` was 3, now `j` is 4)**

Since we don't have the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we generalize it:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `test` is `False` if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, otherwise `test` remains `True`, `j` is incremented by 1**
