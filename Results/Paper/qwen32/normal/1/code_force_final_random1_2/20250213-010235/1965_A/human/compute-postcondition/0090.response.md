Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`n`**: Another integer input.
3. **`l`**: A map object containing integers from a new split input.
4. **`lis`**: A sorted list of unique integers from `l` with more than one element.
5. **`i`**: Incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`), but its value is not used in the print statement.
6. **`test`**: Set to `True`, but its value is also not used in the print statement.
7. **Difference Condition**: The difference between the `j`-th element and the `(j-1)`-th element in `lis` is greater than 1.
8. **Current Value of `j`**: Odd.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement simply outputs the string `'Bob'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `test`, `j`) are used in this print statement. Therefore, their specific values do not affect the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **Bob**
