Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates. `A` is False, `not_c` is False. The difference between the current element `set_[i]` and the previous element `set_[i - 1]` is greater than 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The only change in the state is that the variable `not_c` has been set to `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
