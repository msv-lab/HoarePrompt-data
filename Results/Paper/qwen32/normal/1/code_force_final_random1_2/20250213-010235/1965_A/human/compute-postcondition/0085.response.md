Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is another input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from a new split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`) mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

### Conclusion:
Since the print statement is printing a literal string `'Alice'`, the output will be exactly that string.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
