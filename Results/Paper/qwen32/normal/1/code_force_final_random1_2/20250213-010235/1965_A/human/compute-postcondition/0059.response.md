To determine what will be printed by the `print('Bob')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is another input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `test` is `False` if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, otherwise `test` remains `True`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Explanation:
The `print('Bob')` statement directly outputs the string `'Bob'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `test`, `j`) affect the output of this specific print statement because it explicitly prints the string `'Bob'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print('Bob')` statement is simply the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
