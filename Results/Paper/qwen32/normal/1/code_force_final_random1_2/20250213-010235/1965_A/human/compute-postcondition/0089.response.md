Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `test` is `True`. Additionally, the difference between the `j`-th element and the `(j-1)`-th element in `lis` is greater than 1. The current value of `j` is odd.**
