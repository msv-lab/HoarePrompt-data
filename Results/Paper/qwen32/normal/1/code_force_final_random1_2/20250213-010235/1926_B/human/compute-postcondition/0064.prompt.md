Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1; `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print('SQUARE')
    else:
        print('TRIANGLE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1, `a` is greater than 0, `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each of the `t` strings that were read, provided those strings contained at least one '1'. Additionally, if `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`, then `k[0]` equals `k[1]`; otherwise, `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each string `b` that had '1's during the loop iterations. If `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`, then `k[0]` equals `k[1]`. Otherwise, `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `grid`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is a list containing the counts of the digit '1' in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1'. `t`, `n`, `grid`, and `a` remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations. If the count of '1's in the first input string `b` (`k[0]`) is equal to the count of '1's in the second input string `b` (`k[1]`), then they are equal. Otherwise, `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
