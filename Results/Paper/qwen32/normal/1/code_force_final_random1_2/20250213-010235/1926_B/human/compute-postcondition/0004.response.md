The code snippet `b = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `b`. The type of `b` will be a string since `input()` in Python returns a string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 0, `k` is an empty list, `b` is a string containing the user input.**
