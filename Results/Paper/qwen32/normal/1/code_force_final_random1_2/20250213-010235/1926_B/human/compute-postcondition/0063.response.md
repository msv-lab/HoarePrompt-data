Postcondition: **`k` is a list containing the counts of the digit '1' in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1'. `t`, `n`, `grid`, and `a` remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations. If the count of '1's in the first input string `b` (`k[0]`) is equal to the count of '1's in the second input string `b` (`k[1]`), then they are equal. Otherwise, `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`.**
