The given code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This does not affect the existing variables `t`, `n`, or `grid`. The value of `a` is determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1; `a` is an input integer.**
