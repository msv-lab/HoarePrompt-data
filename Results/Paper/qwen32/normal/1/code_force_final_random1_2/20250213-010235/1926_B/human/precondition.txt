t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's, and the size of the shape (number of rows) is greater than 1.
