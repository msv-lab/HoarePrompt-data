The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'TRIANGLE'`. The initial state provides information about the variable `k`, but it does not affect the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values in `k` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
- The `print` statement is `print('TRIANGLE')`.
- This statement directly prints the string `'TRIANGLE'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'TRIANGLE'`.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
