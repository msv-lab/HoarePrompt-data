The provided initial state does not directly influence the output of the `print` statement in this case. The `print` statement is straightforward and simply outputs the string `'TRIANGLE'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- The initial state provides information about the list `k`, which contains counts of the digit '1' in certain input strings `b`. It also mentions that `t`, `n`, `grid`, and `a` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations. Additionally, it specifies that the count of the digit '1' in the first input string `b` (`k[0]`) is not equal to the count of the digit '1' in the second input string `b` (`k[1]`).

- However, none of these details affect the execution of the `print('TRIANGLE')` statement, which is hardcoded to output the string `'TRIANGLE'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'TRIANGLE'`.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
