You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.

        k = []

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a`, and the program has printed "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" `a` times based on the input strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n × n` grid of strings composed of '0's and '1's. It then determines whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's and prints "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to identify whether a given binary square grid contains a triangle or a square made up of '1's. Here are the key points:
1. **Square**: Consists of `k` consecutive rows, each with `k` consecutive '1's.
2. **Triangle**: Consists of `k` consecutive rows, where the `i-th` row has `2*i-1` consecutive '1's, centered around a vertical axis.
3. **Upside-down Triangle**: Similar to the triangle but inverted.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code reads multiple test cases and processes each grid independently. For each grid:
1. It reads the grid size `n`.
2. It iterates through each row and counts the number of '1's in rows that contain at least one '1'.
3. It stores these counts in a list `k`.
4. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, it prints "SQUARE". Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Counting '1's**: The code only checks the first two rows with '1's and assumes that if they have the same count of '1's, the shape must be a square. This is incorrect because:
   - A triangle can also have the same number of '1's in its first two rows (e.g., a triangle with `k=3` will have 1 and 3 '1's in the first two rows, respectively, but a square with `k=2` will have 2 and 2).
   - The code does not account for the structure of the triangle or square beyond the first two rows.
2. **Handling Upside-down Triangles**: The code does not handle upside-down triangles correctly since it only checks the first two rows.
3. **General Shape Verification**: The code does not verify the entire structure of the shape (whether it is a valid triangle or square) across all rows.

### Conclusion:
The provided code fails to correctly identify the shape based on the problem's requirements. It makes incorrect assumptions about the structure of the shapes based solely on the count of '1's in the first two rows.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
