Postcondition: **`k` is a list containing the counts of the digit '1' in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1'. `t`, `n`, `grid`, and `a` remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations. The count of the digit '1' in the first input string `b` (`k[0]`) is not equal to the count of the digit '1' in the second input string `b` (`k[1]`).**
