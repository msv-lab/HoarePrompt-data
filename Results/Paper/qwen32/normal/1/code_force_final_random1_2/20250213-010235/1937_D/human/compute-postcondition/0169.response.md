To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` step by step using the initial state provided:

1. **Identify the values of the variables:**
   - `a` is explicitly given as `4`.
   - `i` is explicitly given as `2`.
   
2. **Determine the value of `b`:**
   - `b` is defined as `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`.
   - However, the values of `r` and `l` are not explicitly provided. Since they are not defined in the initial state, we cannot directly compute `b`. But we can still express `b` in terms of `r` and `l`.

3. **Express the output in terms of known and unknown variables:**
   - `a * 2` evaluates to `4 * 2 = 8`.
   - `b * 2` remains as `b * 2` because `b` is not fully determined.
   - `i + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes `8 + b * 2 + 3 = 11 + b * 2`.

4. **Final expression:**
   - The final expression to be printed is `11 + b * 2`, where `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`.

Since `r` and `l` are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `b`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `r` and `l`.

Output: **11 + b * 2 (where b is (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1))**
