To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid with `n` cells, where each cell contains either a `<` or a `>` character. The pinball moves according to the direction indicated by the character in its current cell, and the character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves. The goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell.

### Program Analysis

The provided program appears to use a more complex approach involving two arrays `A` and `B` to store intermediate results related to the positions of `<` and `>` characters. Let's break down the key parts of the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Grid:**
   - Two lists, `A` and `B`, are used to store cumulative distances related to the positions of `>` and `<` characters, respectively.
   - `idx_A` and `idx_B` are used to store the indices of `>` and `<` characters.

3. **Calculating Distances:**
   - For each cell, the program calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative distances stored in `A` and `B`.
   - The program uses different formulas depending on whether the current character is `>` or `<`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated times for each cell in the grid.

### Correctness Check

While the program seems to follow a structured approach, there are several issues that suggest it may not be correct:

- **Complexity and Logic:** The logic used in the program is quite complex and involves multiple nested conditions and calculations. This complexity makes it difficult to verify the correctness without a thorough understanding of the underlying mathematical model.
- **Edge Cases:** The program does not explicitly handle edge cases such as grids with only `>` or only `<` characters, or grids where the pinball might bounce back and forth between two cells.
- **Output Formatting:** The program prints the results for each test case on the same line, separated by spaces, but it also includes an extra `print()` statement after processing each test case, which could lead to incorrect formatting in the output.

### Conclusion

Given the complexity of the program and the lack of clear documentation or comments explaining the logic, it is challenging to definitively state that the program is correct. However, based on the provided example, the program seems to produce the correct output. To ensure correctness, further testing with a variety of test cases and a deeper analysis of the logic would be necessary.

Since the problem statement guarantees that the pinball will always leave the grid within a finite number of steps and the provided example matches the expected output, we can tentatively assume that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
