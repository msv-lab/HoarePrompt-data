The given code snippet only modifies the variable `l` by incrementing its value by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the value of `l` is not explicitly provided, but we can infer that since the conditions involving `l` and `r` are used to determine the values of `a` and `b`, `l` must have had some value before this operation.

Since `l` is incremented by 1, if it was previously `l`, it is now `l + 1`.

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `s[i]`, `i`, `r`, `a`, `x`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 2, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `x` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged.**
