The code snippet assigns a value to the variable `i` based on the formula `i = n - 1 - j`. Since the value of `j` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `i`. However, we can express `i` in terms of `n` and `j`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [], `idx_B` is [], `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`**.
