The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. Since `A` was initially an empty list, after appending `x`, `A` now contains one element, which is `x`.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `idx_A`, `i`, `A_last`, `idx_A_last`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list containing one element `x`, `idx_A` is not an empty list, the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>', `x` is `A_last + (i - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`**.
