Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the new state after executing the line `a = B[r]`.

- `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]
- `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]
- `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6]
- `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is 2
- `r` is decreased by 1

Since `r` is decreased by 1, we need to know its original value to determine the new value of `a`. However, the original value of `r` is not provided, so we will denote it as `r_initial`. After the operation `r = r - 1`, the new value of `r` is `r_initial - 1`.

The value of `a` is assigned the value of `B[r]`, which means `a` will take the value of the element at index `r_initial - 1` in list `B`.

Let's consider the possible values of `r_initial` and the corresponding values of `a`:

- If `r_initial` was 3, then `r` becomes 2, and `a` is assigned `B[2]` which is 3.
- If `r_initial` was 2, then `r` becomes 1, and `a` is assigned `B[1]` which is 1.
- If `r_initial` was 1, then `r` becomes 0, and `a` is assigned `B[0]` which is 0.
- If `r_initial` was 0, then `r` becomes -1, and accessing `B[-1]` would give us the last element of `B`, which is 6.

Since the exact value of `r_initial` is not specified, we cannot determine a single value for `a`. However, we can express the new state in terms of `r_initial`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]; `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]; `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6]; `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]; `n` is greater than 0; `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'; `i` is 2; `r` is `r_initial - 1`; `a` is `B[r_initial - 1]`.**
