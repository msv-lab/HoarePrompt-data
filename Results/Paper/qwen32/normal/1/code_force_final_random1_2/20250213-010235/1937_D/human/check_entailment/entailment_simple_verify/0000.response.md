### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a grid of length `n` with each cell containing either `<` or `>`.
- A pinball placed on a cell moves according to the direction indicated by the cell.
- After each move, the direction in the cell is inverted.
- We need to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Lists `A` and `B`:**
     - `A` and `B` are used to store cumulative distances and counts related to the positions of `>` and `<` respectively.
     - `idx_A` and `idx_B` store the indices of `>` and `<` respectively.
   - **Calculations:**
     - The code calculates cumulative distances for `>` and `<` in separate loops.
     - For each `>`, it calculates the cumulative distance considering previous `>` positions.
     - For each `<`, it calculates the cumulative distance considering previous `<` positions.
   - **Pinball Movement Simulation:**
     - The code then uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the number of steps for each starting position.
     - It handles different scenarios based on the current direction (`>` or `<`) and the precomputed values.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations show the state of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` after processing the string.
   - The final state of `A` and `B` seems consistent with the logic of accumulating distances.

#### Issues in the Original Assessment:
1. **Character Inversion:**
   - The original assessment claims that the code does not invert the characters. However, the problem description specifies that the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters are independent for each query. The code does not need to invert characters in the grid since it only needs to compute the number of steps for each starting position independently.

2. **Movement Logic:**
   - The code uses precomputed values to efficiently calculate the number of steps. While this might seem complex, it is a valid approach to handle large inputs within the given constraints.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases implicitly through the precomputation and simulation logic. For example, if the grid is `<`, the pinball will move left and leave the grid in 1 second, which is correctly handled by the precomputation.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The code prints the results for each query on the same line, separated by spaces, which is consistent with the problem statement.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly claims that the code does not simulate the pinball's movement and character inversion correctly. The provided code uses a precomputation technique to efficiently determine the number of steps for each starting position, which is both correct and efficient given the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
