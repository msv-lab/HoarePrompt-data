The value of `a` is assigned the value of `B[r]`. Given that `r` is `3` and `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, the value of `a` becomes `6`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `l` is `0`, `r` is `3`, `n` is greater than `0`, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `r` is not equal to `0`, `a` is `6`**.
