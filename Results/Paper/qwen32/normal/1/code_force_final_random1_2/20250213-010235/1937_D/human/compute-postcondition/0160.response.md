Postcondition: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '>', `l` is incremented by 1. If `l < r`, `a` becomes 2 and `x` becomes `r - (l + 2)`, `b` becomes `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is not less than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0, `a` becomes `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`, `b` becomes `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i]` is not '>', `r` is decremented by 1. If `l` is not equal to 0 and `l <= r`, `a` becomes either -2, -6, -11, or -17 depending on the value of `l`, and `b` is updated to `b_old + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` was initially 0 or `l > r`, `r` remains `r_initial - 1`. If `r` was not initially 0 and `l > r`, `a` becomes `B[r_initial - 1]`. Additionally, if `r_initial` is 2, `l` is 1, and `l > r`, `b` is -8.**
