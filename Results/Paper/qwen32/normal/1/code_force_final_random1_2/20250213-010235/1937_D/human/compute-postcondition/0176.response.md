To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, let's break down the expression:

Given:
- `b` is initially 0 if `l - r > 0`.
- `i` is 2.
- `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7].
- `r` is a variable that affects the value of `a` and is used in the calculation of `b`.

The line of code is:
```python
b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
```

Let's assume `l` is a variable that we need to consider. Since the exact value of `l` is not specified, we'll consider the possible values of `l` that make sense given the context (i.e., `l` should be within the bounds of `idx_A`).

For the sake of this example, let's assume `l` is 1 (since `l` should be a valid index for `idx_A` and `l - r > 0` implies `l > r`).

If `l` is 1:
- `idx_A[l - 1]` would be `idx_A[0]`, which is 3.

Thus, the expression becomes:
```python
b = b + (2 - 3) * r
b = b + (-1) * r
b = b - r
```

Since `b` was initially 0:
- `b` becomes `-r`.

So, the output state, considering `l` is 1, is:
Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 2, `a` is either 1, 1, 0, or -2 depending on the value of `r`, `b` is `-r`**.
