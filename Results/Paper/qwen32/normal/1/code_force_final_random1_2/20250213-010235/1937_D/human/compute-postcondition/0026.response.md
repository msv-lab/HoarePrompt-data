The code appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. Given that `i` is 5, `idx_A` will now contain the value 5. The other variables (`s`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 5; `i` is 5; `idx_A` contains the element 5.**
