To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `j` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop is `for j in range(0, n):`
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.

From the provided information, we know that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change during iterations.

No other variables outside the loop head (`j` and `n`) should be adjusted according to the given instructions.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]; `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`; `s[i]` is `<`; `B` is [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, otherwise `B` remains unchanged; `idx_B` includes `i` as its last element; `j` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not `<`, there is no change to `B` or `idx_B`.**

However, since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, the final simplified state is:

State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]; `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is `j + 1`.**
