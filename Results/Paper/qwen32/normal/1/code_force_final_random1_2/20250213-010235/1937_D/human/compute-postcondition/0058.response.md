To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the state based on the provided information.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates `n` times.
- In each iteration, `i` is calculated as `n - 1 - j`.
- If `s[i] == '<'`, the following actions occur:
  - If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is initialized with `[0]` and `idx_B` is updated to include `i`.
  - If `idx_B` is not empty, a new value `x` is computed and appended to `B`. `idx_B` also appends `i`.

### Given Information:
- Initial State: 
  - `A: [0, 2, 4, 7]`
  - `idx_A: [3, 5, 6, 7]`
  - `B: []`
  - `idx_B: []`

- After the first iteration (`j=0`), if `s[n-1] == '<'`:
  - `B: [0]`
  - `idx_B: [n-1]`

- After the second iteration (`j=1`), if `s[n-2] == '<'`:
  - `B: [0, x]` where `x = 0 + (n-1 - (n-2)) * 1 = 1`
  - `idx_B: [n-1, n-2]`

- After the third iteration (`j=2`), if `s[n-3] == '<'`:
  - `B: [0, 1, y]` where `y = 1 + ((n-2) - (n-3)) * 2 = 3`
  - `idx_B: [n-1, n-2, n-3]`

### General Pattern:
- For each iteration `j` where `s[n-1-j] == '<'`, a new value is added to `B` and `idx_B`.
- The new value in `B` is computed based on the previous value in `B` and the difference between the current index `i` and the previous index in `idx_B`.

### Final Output State:
Assuming `s[i] == '<'` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0` (i.e., all characters in `s` are `<`), the loop will execute `n` times, and `B` and `idx_B` will grow accordingly.

- `B` will contain the sequence `[0, 1, 3, 6, ..., sum of first (n-1) natural numbers]`.
- `idx_B` will contain the sequence `[n-1, n-2, ..., 0]`.

If `s[i] != '<'` for some `i`, the corresponding iteration will not modify `B` or `idx_B`.

### Conclusion:
For simplicity, let's assume `n=4` and `s='<<<'` (all characters are `<`).

- After 4 iterations:
  - `B: [0, 1, 3, 6]`
  - `idx_B: [3, 2, 1, 0]`

Output State: **A: [0, 2, 4, 7], idx_A: [3, 5, 6, 7], B: [0, 1, 3, 6], idx_B: [3, 2, 1, 0]**.

This means that after all iterations, `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged, while `B` and `idx_B` are populated according to the pattern described.
