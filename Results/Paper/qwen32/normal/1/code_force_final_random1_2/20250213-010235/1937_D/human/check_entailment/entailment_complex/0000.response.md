### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program is correct, let's analyze the logic and the approach taken by the code. The goal is to simulate the movement of a pinball on a grid where each cell can either push the pinball left ('<') or right ('>'). The pinball stops when it leaves the grid, and we need to calculate how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

The program uses two main lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of cumulative movements caused by '>' and '<' characters, respectively. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization and Preprocessing:**
   - For '>' characters, the program calculates cumulative movements in list `A`. Each element in `A` represents the total number of steps contributed by '>' characters up to that point.
   - Similarly, for '<' characters, the program calculates cumulative movements in list `B`.

2. **Processing Each Query:**
   - For each cell, the program determines whether it should use the cumulative movements from `A` or `B` based on the direction of the character at that cell.
   - If the character is '>', it uses the cumulative movements from `A` and adjusts for any remaining movements from `B`.
   - If the character is '<', it uses the cumulative movements from `B` and adjusts for any remaining movements from `A`.

3. **Calculating Output:**
   - The program calculates the total time for the pinball to leave the grid by combining the contributions from `A` and `B` and adjusting for the current position and direction.
   - The final result for each cell is printed.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Cumulative Movements Calculation:**
  - The cumulative movements in `A` and `B` seem to correctly account for the contributions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
  - The indices `idx_A` and `idx_B` help in tracking the positions of '>' and '<' characters, which is crucial for calculating the correct cumulative movements.

- **Query Processing:**
  - The logic for processing each query seems to correctly handle the transitions between `A` and `B` based on the direction of the character at the current cell.
  - The adjustments made to the cumulative movements appear to correctly account for the remaining movements from the opposite direction.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when there are no '>' or '<' characters, and when the pinball immediately leaves the grid.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the logic and the provided states, the program appears to correctly simulate the movement of the pinball and calculate the required times for each query. The cumulative movements and the adjustments made during query processing seem to be correctly implemented.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
