The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Since the initial state does not specify the current contents of `idx_B`, we can only infer that after the operation, `idx_B` will include the new element `i`.

Given:
- `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`
- `j` is `j + 1` (this implies `j` was incremented before this line, but its exact value is not given)

Therefore, the new value of `i` is `n - 1 - ((j + 1) + 1)` which simplifies to `n - 1 - j - 2` or `n - j - 3`.

Since the exact value of `j` is not specified, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i`. However, we know that `i` is calculated based on `n` and `j`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]; `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is `j + 1`; `i` is `n - j - 3`; `idx_B` includes the new element `i` appended at the end.**
