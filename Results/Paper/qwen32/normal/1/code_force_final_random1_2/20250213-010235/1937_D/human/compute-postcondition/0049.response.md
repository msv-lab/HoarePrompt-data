Postcondition: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]; `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; `s[i]` is `<`; `B` is [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, otherwise `B` remains unchanged; `idx_B` includes `i` as its last element; `j` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not `<`, there is no change to `B` or `idx_B`.**
