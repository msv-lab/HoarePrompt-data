Given the precondition and the if condition, we need to determine the postcondition for when the program does not enter the if block and instead enters the else block. Here's the breakdown:

- Precondition:
  - `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
  - `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
  - `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
  - `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
  - `l` is `0`
  - `r` is `3`
  - `n` is greater than `0`
  - `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`
  - `l` is greater than `r` (which contradicts the given `l` and `r` values, so this part seems incorrect as per the provided values)

- If condition:
  ```python
  if (r == 0):
  ```

Since the program does not enter the if block, the negation of the if condition must be true. Therefore, `r` is not equal to `0`.

However, there is a contradiction in the precondition where it states `l` is greater than `r`, but `l` is `0` and `r` is `3`. Given the values, `l` is not greater than `r`. For the sake of this task, I'll assume the values provided (`l = 0`, `r = 3`) are correct and ignore the contradictory statement about `l > r`.

Here is the postcondition:

Postcondition: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `l` is `0`, `r` is `3`, `n` is greater than `0`, and `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`. Additionally, `r` is not equal to `0`**
