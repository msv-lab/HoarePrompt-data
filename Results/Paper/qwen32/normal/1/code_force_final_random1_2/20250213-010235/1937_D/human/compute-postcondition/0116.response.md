Postcondition: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `l` is `0`, `n` is greater than `0`, and `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`. If `r` is `0`, then `r` is not greater than `l` and `l` is not greater than `r`. Otherwise, `r` remains `3` and `b` is `(i - 7) * 4`.**
