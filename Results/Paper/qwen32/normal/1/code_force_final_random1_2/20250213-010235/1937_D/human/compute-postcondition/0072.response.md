To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the expression inside the `print` function step-by-step.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `l` is `0`
- `r` is `4`
- `n` is greater than `0`
- `s[i]` is `'>'`
- `a` is `0`
- `x` is `2`
- `b` is `-i`
- `l` is less than `r`
- `x` is greater than or equal to `0`

### Expression Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `a` is `0`
- `b` is `-i`

However, the variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we need to express the output in terms of `i`.

Let's break down the expression:
- `a * 2` is `0 * 2` which equals `0`
- `b * 2` is `(-i) * 2` which equals `-2i`
- Adding `i + 1` to the above results in `0 + (-2i) + i + 1` which simplifies to `-i + 1`

Thus, the expression evaluates to `-i + 1`.

### Final Output:
Since `i` is not explicitly defined, we cannot provide a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `i`.

Output: **-i + 1 (where i is an undefined variable in the given initial state)**
