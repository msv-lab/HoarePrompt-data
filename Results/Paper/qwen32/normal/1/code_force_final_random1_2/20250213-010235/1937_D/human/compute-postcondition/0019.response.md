The code appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. Given that `i` is 4, `idx_A` will now include this value as its last element. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 4; `idx_A` has an additional element `4` appended to it. If `idx_A` was initially empty, `A` has an additional element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (4 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A) - 1`, and `A` includes `x` as its last element.**
