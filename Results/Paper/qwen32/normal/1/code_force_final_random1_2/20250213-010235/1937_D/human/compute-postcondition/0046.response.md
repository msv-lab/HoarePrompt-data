Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `s[i]` is `<`, `B` is not empty and includes the new element `x`, `idx_B` is not empty and includes `i` as its last element, `x` is `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `j` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The list `B` now includes one more element `x` appended to it. The value of `x` is calculated based on the previous last element of `B` and the second last element of `idx_B`. All other variables remain unchanged.
