Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is 1
- `r` is decreased by 1

Code Snippet:
```python
a = B[r]
```

Since `r` is decreased by 1 before this line, we need to determine its value. However, the exact value of `r` before the decrement is not specified, so we'll assume it was initially some value `k`. After the decrement, `r` would be `k-1`.

The value of `a` is assigned the value of `B[r]`. Since `r` is now `k-1`, the value of `a` will be `B[k-1]`.

Given the array `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, the possible values for `a` depend on the value of `k-1`:

- If `k-1` is 0, `a` is `B[0]` which is `0`.
- If `k-1` is 1, `a` is `B[1]` which is `1`.
- If `k-1` is 2, `a` is `B[2]` which is `3`.
- If `k-1` is 3, `a` is `B[3]` which is `6`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. However, we know `a` will be one of the elements in `B`.

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `s[i]`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `B[r]` (which is one of `0, 1, 3, 6` depending on the initial value of `r`).**
