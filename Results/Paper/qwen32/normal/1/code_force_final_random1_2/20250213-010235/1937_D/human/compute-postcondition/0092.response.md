To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and identify the relevant variables and their values.

Here's the breakdown of the given initial state:
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is 3.
- `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7].
- `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7].
- `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6].
- `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0].
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `s[i]` is not equal to '>'.

However, the variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since the `print` statement includes `i + 1`, we need to infer the value of `i`.

Given that `s[i]` is mentioned but `s` and `i` are not fully defined, let's assume `i` is within the bounds of the lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` (which have a length of 4). Without loss of generality, let's consider the possible values of `i` from 0 to 3.

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for `i`, we can't determine a single exact value for `i`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `i`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

This means it will print `i + 1` followed by a space, without moving to a new line.

Given the possible values of `i` (0, 1, 2, 3), the possible outputs are:
- If `i` is 0, it prints `1`.
- If `i` is 1, it prints `2`.
- If `i` is 2, it prints `3`.
- If `i` is 3, it prints `4`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `i`.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is an integer between 0 and 3 inclusive)**
