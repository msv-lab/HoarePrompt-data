The code snippet `idx_B.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. This means that the length of `idx_B` increases by 1, and the last element of `idx_B` is now `i`.

Given the initial state, `idx_B` could either be empty or contain some elements. Since the code modifies `idx_B` by appending `i`, we need to consider both scenarios:

1. If `idx_B` was initially empty, it becomes `[i]`.
2. If `idx_B` was not empty, `i` is added to the end of `idx_B`.

Since the problem specifies that `j` is incremented by 1 after this operation, we also need to account for this change.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `A` remains [0, 2, 4, 7].
- `idx_A` remains [3, 5, 6, 7].
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains `n - 1 - j`.
- `s[i]` remains `<`.
- `B` remains unchanged (either [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or it remains as it was).
- `idx_B` now includes `i` as its last element.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]; `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; `s[i]` is `<`; `B` is [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, otherwise `B` remains unchanged; `idx_B` includes `i` as its last element; `j` is incremented by 1.**
