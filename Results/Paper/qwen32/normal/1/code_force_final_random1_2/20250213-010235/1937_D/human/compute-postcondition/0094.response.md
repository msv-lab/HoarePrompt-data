Given the initial state and the code snippet, the value of `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1]`. Since `l` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `r` (which is 3), let's consider the possible values for `l`.

If `l` is 1, then `a = A[0]` which is 0.
If `l` is 2, then `a = A[1]` which is 2.
If `l` is 3, then `a = A[2]` which is 4.

Since the exact value of `l` is not specified, we can only say that `a` will take one of these values based on `l`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `l` is greater than 0, `r` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '>', `a` is `A[l - 1]`**.
