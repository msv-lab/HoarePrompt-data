To determine the new value of `b` after executing the given line of code, we need to consider the current values of `b`, `idx_B`, `r`, and `i`, and the value of `l`.

Given:
- `b` is either `-3 - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l)` or `-2 - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l)` if `r - l >= 0`. If `r - l < 0`, `b` remains unchanged.
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`.
- `r` is decreased by 1, so let's denote the previous value of `r` as `r_old`. Therefore, `r = r_old - 1`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `l` is a value that determines the calculation of `b`.

Let's denote the previous value of `b` as `b_old`. The new value of `b` is calculated as:
\[ b = b_{\text{old}} + (idx_B[r] - i) \times l \]

Since `r` is now `r_old - 1`, we need to find `idx_B[r]` which is `idx_B[r_old - 1]`.

The possible values of `b` before the operation were:
- `-3 - (idx_B[r_old - l] - 1) * (r_old - l)` or
- `-2 - (idx_B[r_old - l] - 1) * (r_old - l)` if `r_old - l >= 0`.

After the operation, the new value of `b` becomes:
\[ b = (-3 - (idx_B[r_old - l] - 1) * (r_old - l)) + (idx_B[r_old - 1] - 1) \times l \]
or
\[ b = (-2 - (idx_B[r_old - l] - 1) * (r_old - l)) + (idx_B[r_old - 1] - 1) \times l \]

Since the exact values of `r_old` and `l` are not specified, we can't compute a specific numerical value for `b`. However, we can express the new value of `b` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is either -2, -6, -11, or -17 depending on the value of `l`, `b` is updated to `b_old + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` where `b_old` is the previous value of `b` and `r` is `r_old - 1`.**
