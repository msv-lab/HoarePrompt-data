Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `A` is a list: `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is a list: `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is a list: `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is a list: `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0 (the exact value of `n` is not specified but it is positive).
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', but the specific value of `s[1]` is not provided.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `r` is decreased by 1, but the initial value of `r` is not provided, so we cannot determine its new value.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know that `i` is 1. Therefore, `i + 1` evaluates to `1 + 1`, which is `2`.

The `end=' '` argument specifies that after printing the value, a space should be added instead of a newline character.

### Final Output:
Based on the above analysis, the print statement will output the value `2` followed by a space.

Output: **2 **
