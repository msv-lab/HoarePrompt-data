Postcondition: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 2, `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` was initially 0, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r_initial - 1]` and `b` is `1 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r_initial` if `b` was `1` or `4 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r_initial` if `b` was `4`.**
