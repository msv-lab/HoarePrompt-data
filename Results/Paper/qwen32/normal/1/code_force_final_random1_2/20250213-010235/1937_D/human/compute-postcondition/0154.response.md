To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given expression:

```python
b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
```

Given the initial state:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is 1
- `r` is `r_initial - 1`
- `a` is `B[r_initial - 1]`
- `b` is `-2`

Let's substitute the known values into the equation. However, there are two undefined variables `l` and `r_initial`. Since `r` is defined as `r_initial - 1`, we can infer that `r_initial` is `r + 1`.

We need to know the values of `l` and `r_initial` to proceed. Without these values, we cannot compute the exact numerical result. However, let's assume hypothetical values for `l` and `r_initial` to demonstrate the calculation process.

For demonstration purposes, let's assume:
- `l` is 3
- `r_initial` is 3, which means `r` is 2

Now, substituting these values into the equation:

```python
b = -2 - (idx_A[3 - 1] - idx_A[3 - 2 - 2]) * (3 - 2 - 1)
b = -2 - (idx_A[2] - idx_A[-1]) * (0)
b = -2 - (6 - 7) * 0
b = -2 - (-1) * 0
b = -2 - 0
b = -2
```

Since the multiplication by `(l - r - 1)` results in 0, the value of `b` remains unchanged.

Thus, the output state, assuming `l` is 3 and `r_initial` is 3, is:

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `r` is `r_initial - 1`, `a` is `B[r_initial - 1]`, `b` is `-2`**

If different values for `l` and `r_initial` were provided, the value of `b` would change accordingly.
