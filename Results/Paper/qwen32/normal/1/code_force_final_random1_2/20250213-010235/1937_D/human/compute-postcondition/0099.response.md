To determine the new value of `b`, we use the given formula:

\[ b = b - (idx\_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) \]

Given:
- `b` is initially 3.
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`.
- `r` is 3.
- `l` is greater than 0 (let's denote it as `l`).
- `i` is not specified directly but is part of the calculation.

Let's calculate `idx_B[r - l]`. Since `r` is 3 and `l` is greater than 0, `r - l` can range from 2 down to 0 (as long as `l` does not exceed 3).

For the sake of specificity, let's consider the possible values of `r - l` and see how they affect the calculation:

1. If `l` is 1, then `r - l` is 2, and `idx_B[2]` is 1.
2. If `l` is 2, then `r - l` is 1, and `idx_B[1]` is 2.
3. If `l` is 3, then `r - l` is 0, and `idx_B[0]` is 3.

Let's assume a specific value for `l` to proceed with the calculation. For simplicity, let's assume `l` is 1, making `r - l` equal to 2. Therefore, `idx_B[r - l]` is `idx_B[2]`, which is 1.

Now, the formula becomes:

\[ b = 3 - (1 - i) * 2 \]

Without a specific value for `i`, we can't simplify further, but we can express the new value of `b` in terms of `i`.

Thus, the new value of `b` is:

\[ b = 3 - (1 - i) * 2 \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ b = 3 - 2 + 2i \]
\[ b = 1 + 2i \]

Therefore, the updated value of `b` depends on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `l` is greater than 0, `r` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '>', `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `1 + 2i`, and `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0.**
