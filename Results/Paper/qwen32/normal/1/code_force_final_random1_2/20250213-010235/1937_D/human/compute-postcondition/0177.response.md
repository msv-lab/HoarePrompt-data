To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` step-by-step using the provided initial state:

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `a` is described as being one of the values 1, 1, 0, or -2 depending on the value of `r`.
   - `b` is described as `-r`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `a * 2`: This depends on the value of `a`.
   - `b * 2`: Since `b = -r`, this becomes `-2 * r`.
   - `(n - i)`: Since `i` is 2, this becomes `(n - 2)`.

3. **Combining the parts:**
   - The full expression is `a * 2 + (-2 * r) + (n - 2)`.
   - Simplifying, it becomes `2a - 2r + n - 2`.

4. **Considering the possible values of `a` and `r`:**
   - If `a` is 1, then `2a` is 2.
   - If `a` is 0, then `2a` is 0.
   - If `a` is -2, then `2a` is -4.
   - Since `b = -r`, `-2r` means that the value of `-2r` depends on `r`.

5. **Final Expression with Variables:**
   - The expression `2a - 2r + n - 2` will depend on the specific values of `a` and `r`.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact numerical value without knowing `r` and `n`. However, we can express the output in terms of `a`, `r`, and `n`.

Output: **2a - 2r + n - 2 (where a is either 1, 1, 0, or -2 depending on the value of r, and n is greater than 0)**
