To determine the new value of `b` after executing the given line of code, we need to evaluate the expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` and add it to the current value of `b`.

Given:
- `i` is 1.
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`.
- `l` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the expression `idx_A[l - 1]`. We need to assume a value for `l` to proceed. Since `l` is not specified, let's consider the possible values for `l` that make sense within the bounds of `idx_A` (i.e., `l` can be 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- `r` is `r_initial - 1` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `r` remains `r_initial - 1`. This means `r` is essentially `r_initial - 1` regardless of the condition.
- `b` is `-2` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` remains `0`. Again, this means `b` is either `-2` or `0` depending on the condition.

Let's assume `l` is 1 for simplicity, which means `idx_A[l - 1]` is `idx_A[0]` which is `3`.

So the expression becomes:
\[ b = b + (1 - 3) * (r + 1) \]
\[ b = b + (-2) * (r + 1) \]

If `b` was initially `-2`:
\[ b = -2 + (-2) * (r + 1) \]
\[ b = -2 - 2(r + 1) \]
\[ b = -2 - 2r - 2 \]
\[ b = -4 - 2r \]

If `b` was initially `0`:
\[ b = 0 + (-2) * (r + 1) \]
\[ b = -2(r + 1) \]
\[ b = -2r - 2 \]

Since `r` is `r_initial - 1`, we can express `b` in terms of `r_initial`:

If `b` was initially `-2`:
\[ b = -4 - 2(r_initial - 1) \]
\[ b = -4 - 2r_initial + 2 \]
\[ b = -2 - 2r_initial \]

If `b` was initially `0`:
\[ b = -2(r_initial - 1) - 2 \]
\[ b = -2r_initial + 2 - 2 \]
\[ b = -2r_initial \]

Since the exact value of `r_initial` is not provided, we can only express `b` in terms of `r_initial`.

However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `l` or `r_initial`, we can assume the simplest case where `b` was initially `-2` and `l` is 1. Thus, the final value of `b` would be `-4 - 2r_initial`.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `r_initial` is 2, making `r` equal to 1. Then:
\[ b = -4 - 2(2) \]
\[ b = -4 - 4 \]
\[ b = -8 \]

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `r` is `r_initial - 1` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `r` remains `r_initial - 1`, `a` is `B[r_initial - 1]`, `b` is `-8` if `r_initial` is 2 and `l` is 1.**
