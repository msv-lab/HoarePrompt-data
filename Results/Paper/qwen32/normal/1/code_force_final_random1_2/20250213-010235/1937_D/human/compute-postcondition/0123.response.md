To determine the output state, let's first identify the relevant variables and their values before executing the given line of code:

- `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]
- `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]
- `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6]
- `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is 1
- `a` is 2
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`
- `b` is `B[r - 1]`

The line of code to execute is:
```python
b = b - B[x]
```

We need to determine the new value of `b` after this operation. We know that `b` is initially `B[r - 1]`. To find the new value of `b`, we need to know the values of `r`, `l`, and `x`.

However, the values of `r` and `l` are not explicitly provided in the initial state. Since we don't have specific values for `r` and `l`, we'll express `x` in terms of `r` and `l` and keep the expression for `b` in terms of these variables.

Given:
- `x = r - (l + 2)`
- `b = B[r - 1]`

After executing the line `b = b - B[x]`, the new value of `b` will be:
- `b = B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)]`

Since the values of `r` and `l` are not specified, we cannot simplify this further. However, we can express the final state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]; `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]; `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6]; `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]; `n` is greater than 0; `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'; `i` is 1; `a` is 2; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`; `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)]`**
