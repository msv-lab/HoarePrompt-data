The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - (j + 1))) * len(idx_B)`.

After appending `x` to `B`, the new state of `B` will include this new element at the end.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`; `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is `j + 1`; `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`; `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - (j + 1))) * len(idx_B)`; `B` includes the new element `x` appended at the end.**
