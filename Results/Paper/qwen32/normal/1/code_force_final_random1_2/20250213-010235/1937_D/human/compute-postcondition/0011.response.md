Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list containing either one element `0` or one element `[x]`, `idx_A` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'. If `idx_A` is empty, `A` contains the single element `0`. Otherwise, `A` contains one element `[x]` where `x` is `0 + (i - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`**
