The value of `x` is calculated as `r - (l + 2)`. Given that `r` is 4 and `l` is 0, the calculation becomes `4 - (0 + 2)`, which simplifies to `4 - 2`, resulting in `x` being 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `l` is 0, `r` is 4, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is `'>'`, `a` is 0, `x` is 2, and `l` is less than `r`.**
