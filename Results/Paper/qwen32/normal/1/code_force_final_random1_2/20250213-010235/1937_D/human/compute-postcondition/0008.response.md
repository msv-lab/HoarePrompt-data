Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `A` is an empty list
- `idx_A` is not an empty list
- The current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'

Code Snippet:
```python
x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
```

Since `A` is an empty list, `A[len(A) - 1]` would normally refer to the last element of `A`. However, because `A` is empty, this would raise an `IndexError`. To avoid this, we should assume that the code is only executed when `A` is not empty, or there is some context that ensures `A` has elements when this line is reached. For the sake of this task, let's assume `A` has at least one element.

Let's denote the last element of `A` as `A_last` and the last element of `idx_A` as `idx_A_last`.

Thus, the equation becomes:
```python
x = A_last + (i - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)
```

Since `A` is not empty, `A_last` is the last element of `A`. Similarly, `idx_A_last` is the last element of `idx_A`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `s` remains a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `A` remains an empty list (unless modified elsewhere in the code, which is not shown here)
- `idx_A` remains not an empty list
- The current character at index `i` in `s` remains '>'
- `x` is calculated as `A_last + (i - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is not an empty list, the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>', `x` is `A_last + (i - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`**
