Postcondition: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `s[i]` is `<`. If `len(idx_B)` was initially 0, then `B` becomes [0] and `idx_B` becomes `[i]`. Otherwise, `B` includes the new element `x`, where `x` is `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - i) * len(idx_B)` if `len(idx_B)` was not 0, and `idx_B` includes `i` as its last element. In both cases, `j` is incremented by 1.**
