To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the specific print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0 (but its exact value is not specified)
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'` (but the exact value of `s[i]` is not specified)
- `i` is `1`

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is explicitly given as `1`.

However, the value of `n` is not explicitly provided. We only know that `n` is greater than 0. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical result for `n - i`. 

But we can express the output in terms of `n`:
- `n - i` translates to `n - 1` because `i` is `1`.

Thus, the output will be `n - 1` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
Output: **n - 1 (where n is a value greater than 0)**
