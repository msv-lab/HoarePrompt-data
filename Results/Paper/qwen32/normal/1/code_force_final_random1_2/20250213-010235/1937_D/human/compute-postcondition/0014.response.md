To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the conditions:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- If `s[i]` is '>', `A` is updated to contain either one element `0` or one element `[x]`, and `idx_A` is updated to include the current index `i`.
- If `s[i]` is not '>', `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.

Let's break down the state adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`). At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.
2. **Variable `n`:** This remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `n`) can be adjusted, we don't need to adjust the states of `s`, `A`, or `idx_A` directly here.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration `i` was 3 (as an example), the next value of `i` would be 4. The value of `n` remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 4**.

If we assume `i` was some other value at the end of the previous iteration, we would simply increment that value by 1. Since the exact previous value of `i` isn't specified, we can generalize the answer as follows:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 1`**

However, since we need a concrete example, let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 4**
