To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- Initial State: `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`; `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is `j + 1`; `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`
- Code Snippet: `x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`

From the code snippet, we see that the variable `x` is being assigned a new value based on elements from lists `B` and `idx_B`. However, the initial state does not include these lists (`B` and `idx_B`). Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `x` without knowing the contents of `B` and `idx_B`.

However, we can express `x` in terms of the known variables and the unknown elements of `B` and `idx_B`.

Let's denote:
- `B_last` as `B[len(B) - 1]`
- `idx_B_last` as `idx_B[len(B) - 1]`
- `len_idx_B` as `len(idx_B)`

Then the expression for `x` can be rewritten as:
\[ x = B_{\text{last}} + (\text{idx\_B}_{\text{last}} - i) \times \text{len\_idx\_B} \]

We know that `i` is defined as `n - 1 - (j + 1)`.

Therefore, the output state will include the expression for `x` in terms of the known and unknown variables.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`; `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is `j + 1`; `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`; `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - (j + 1))) * len(idx_B)`**
