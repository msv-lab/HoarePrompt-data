The code snippet provided is `x = r - (l + 2)`. However, the initial state does not include the variables `r` and `l`. Since these variables are not defined in the initial state, their values are unknown, and thus, the value of `x` cannot be determined from the given information.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the introduction of the variable `x` with an undefined value based on the unknown values of `r` and `l`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 2, `a` is 4, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.
