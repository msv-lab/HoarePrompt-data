To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the expression step by step using the initial state provided:

### Given Variables and Initial State:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0 (specific value not provided)
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'` (specific value not provided)
- `i` is `1`
- `a` is `2`
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)` (values of `r` and `l` not provided)
- `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` (values of `r` and `l` not provided)

### Expression to Evaluate:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Value of `a`:**
   - `a` is explicitly given as `2`.

2. **Value of `b`:**
   - `b` is defined as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
   - Since `i` is `1`, `b` becomes `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`.
   - The specific values of `r` and `l` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `b`. However, we can express `b` in terms of `r` and `l`.

3. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `a * 2` evaluates to `2 * 2 = 4`.
   - `b * 2` evaluates to `2 * ((idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1))`.
   - `i + 1` evaluates to `1 + 1 = 2`.

4. **Combining the Values:**
   - The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` becomes `4 + 2 * ((idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)) + 2`.
   - Simplifying further, it becomes `6 + 2 * ((idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1))`.

### Final Output:
Given that the exact values of `r` and `l` are not provided, we can only express the final output in terms of these variables.

Output: **6 + 2 * ((idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1))**
