Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s`.
- `h` is not equal to '00'.
- `h` as an integer is greater than 12.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `h`**: 
   - `h` is the first two characters of the string `s`.
   - `h` is not '00'.
   - `h` as an integer is greater than 12, meaning `h` could be any string representation of a number from 13 to 99.

2. **Expression `int(h) - 12`**:
   - Convert `h` to an integer.
   - Subtract 12 from this integer.

3. **String Formatting**:
   - The result of `int(h) - 12` is converted to a string.
   - This string is prefixed with '0'.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The final string is printed without a newline character (`end=''`).

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `h` is '13':
  - `int(h) - 12` = 13 - 12 = 1
  - `'0{}'.format(1)` results in '01'
- Suppose `h` is '25':
  - `int(h) - 12` = 25 - 12 = 13
  - `'0{}'.format(13)` results in '013'

### General Case:
- For any valid `h` (13 to 99):
  - The expression `int(h) - 12` will yield a result between 1 and 87.
  - The result will be prefixed with '0', resulting in a string that starts with '0' followed by a number between 1 and 87.

### Final Output Description:
Given the constraints, the output will always be a string starting with '0' followed by a number between 1 and 87.

Output: **0[number] (where number is the result of int(h) - 12 and 1 ≤ number ≤ 87)**
