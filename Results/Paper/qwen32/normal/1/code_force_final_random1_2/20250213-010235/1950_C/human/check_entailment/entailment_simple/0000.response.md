### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program to see if it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.

2. **Extracting Hour and Minute:**
   - It extracts the hour part (`h`) from the string `s` using slicing (`s[:2]`).
   - It keeps the minute part as is (`s[2:]`).

3. **Converting Hour:**
   - If the hour is `'00'`, it prints `'12'` (midnight in 12-hour format).
   - If the hour is between `'01'` and `'12'`, it prints the hour as is.
   - If the hour is greater than `'12'`, it subtracts 12 from the hour and formats it to ensure it has a leading zero if necessary (e.g., `'09'` instead of `'9'`).

4. **Appending AM/PM:**
   - It appends `'AM'` if the original hour is less than 12.
   - It appends `'PM'` if the original hour is 12 or more.

### Issues Identified:

- **Handling Hours Greater Than 12:**
  - The program incorrectly formats hours greater than 12 by prefixing them with `'0'`. For example, if the input is `'13:00'`, the program would output `'01:00 PM'` instead of `'01:00 PM'` (which is correct but the formatting logic needs to be adjusted). However, the main issue is with hours like `'13:00'` being output as `'01:00 PM'` instead of `'01:00 PM'` (which is already correct in terms of value but the formatting logic is flawed).
  
- **Specific Case of Midnight and Noon:**
  - Midnight (`'00:00'`) is correctly handled as `'12:00 AM'`.
  - Noon (`'12:00'`) is correctly handled as `'12:00 PM'`.

### Corrected Logic:

The logic for converting hours greater than 12 should ensure that the hour is formatted correctly without adding an unnecessary leading zero for single-digit hours. Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
if h == '00':
    print('12', end='')
elif int(h) <= 12:
    print(h.zfill(2), end='')  # Ensure two digits
else:
    print(str(int(h) - 12).zfill(2), end='')  # Ensure two digits
```

However, the provided program does not have this issue because the `print` statement already ensures that the hour is printed correctly. The main issue is that the program does not handle the conversion of hours greater than 12 correctly by adding an unnecessary leading zero.

### Conclusion:

Despite the minor formatting issue, the program correctly converts the times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation based on the provided examples. Therefore, the program is essentially correct in terms of functionality.

**Correctness: True**
