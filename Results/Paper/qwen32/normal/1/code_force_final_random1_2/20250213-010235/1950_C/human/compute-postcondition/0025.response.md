Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is the new string input by the user.
- `h` is the first two characters of the new string `s`.
- Additional conditions on `h` are provided but they do not affect the `print` statement directly.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('12', end='')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` function in Python outputs the specified message to the console.
- In this case, the message is the string `'12'`.
- The `end=''` parameter specifies that after printing the message, no newline character (`\n`) should be added to the end of the output. This means the cursor will remain on the same line after printing.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'12'` without moving to a new line afterward.

### Final Output:
Output: **12**
