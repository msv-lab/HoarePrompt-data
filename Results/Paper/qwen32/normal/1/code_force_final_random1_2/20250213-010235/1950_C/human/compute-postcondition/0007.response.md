Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s`.
- `h` is not equal to '00'.
- The integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(h, end='')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `h`**: 
   - `h` is derived from the first two characters of the string `s`.
   - It is explicitly stated that `h` is not equal to '00'.
   - Additionally, the integer value of `h` must be between 1 and 12 inclusive.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` function is used with the argument `h` and `end=''`.
   - The `end=''` parameter ensures that no newline character is added after printing `h`.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints, `h` will be a two-character string representing an hour in the 12-hour format (e.g., '01', '02', ..., '12'). Since `h` cannot be '00', it will be one of the valid hour representations.

### Output:
The code will print the first two characters of the string `s` which represent the hour in the 12-hour format without adding a newline character at the end.

Output: **h (where h is the first two characters of the string s representing the hour in the 12-hour format)**
