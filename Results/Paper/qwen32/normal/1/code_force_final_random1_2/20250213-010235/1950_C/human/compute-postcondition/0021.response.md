Let's break down the given Python code snippet and determine what it prints based on the initial state provided:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 1440\).
- `s` is a new string input by the user.
- `h` is the first two characters of the new string `s`.
  - If `h` equals '00', then `h` remains '00'.
  - Otherwise, if the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `h` is less than or equal to 12.
  - Otherwise, `h` is greater than 12.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

### Explanation:
1. **`s[2:]`**:
   - This part of the code extracts the substring of `s` starting from the third character (index 2) to the end of the string.
   - For example, if `s` is "12:30 PM", then `s[2:]` would be ":30 PM".

2. **`['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`**:
   - This part of the code uses a list indexing trick to determine whether to print 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - `int(h) >= 12` evaluates to a boolean value (`True` or `False`).
     - If `int(h) >= 12` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `1`, and `['AM', 'PM'][1]` is `'PM'`.
     - If `int(h) >= 12` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `0`, and `['AM', 'PM'][0]` is `'AM'`.

### Combining the Outputs:
- The first part (`s[2:]`) will print the substring of `s` starting from the third character.
- The second part (`['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`) will print either `'AM'` or `'PM'` based on the value of `h`.

### Example Scenarios:
1. If `s` is "09:45 AM":
   - `s[2:]` is ":45 AM".
   - `h` is "09", so `int(h) >= 12` is `False`, thus `['AM', 'PM'][False]` is `'AM'`.
   - Output: **":45 AM"**

2. If `s` is "13:30 PM":
   - `s[2:]` is ":30 PM".
   - `h` is "13", so `int(h) >= 12` is `True`, thus `['AM', 'PM'][True]` is `'PM'`.
   - Output: **":30 PM"**

### General Output Description:
The code prints the substring of `s` starting from the third character, followed by either `'AM'` or `'PM'` depending on whether the integer value of the first two characters of `s` is greater than or equal to 12.

### Final Output:
Output: **s[2:] ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12] (where s[2:] is the substring of s starting from the third character, and ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12] is 'AM' if int(h) < 12 and 'PM' if int(h) >= 12)**
