Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and the function summary to determine its correctness according to the problem description.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes:**
   - It extracts the hour part (`h`) from the string `s` using slicing (`s[:2]`).
   - It keeps the minutes part as `s[2:]`.

3. **Converting Hours:**
   - If the hour `h` is `'00'`, it outputs `'12'` (midnight in 12-hour format).
   - If the hour `h` is less than or equal to `'12'`, it outputs the hour as it is.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than `'12'`, it converts it to the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from the hour and formats it with a leading zero if necessary.

4. **Determining AM or PM:**
   - It uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` to determine whether to append 'AM' or 'PM' to the time.
   - It checks if the hour `h` is greater than or equal to `'12'` to decide between 'AM' and 'PM'.

5. **Output Formatting:**
   - It prints the converted hour followed by the minutes and the appropriate suffix ('AM' or 'PM').

### Issues Identified

- **Incorrect Hour Conversion for PM Times:**
  - When converting hours greater than `'12'`, the program incorrectly prepends a '0' to the result. This results in incorrect formatting for hours 13 to 19 (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.). The correct conversion should not add a leading zero unless the resulting hour is less than 10.

- **Handling of Midnight and Noon:**
  - The program correctly handles midnight ('00' -> '12 AM') and noon ('12' -> '12 PM').

- **Output Formatting:**
  - The program correctly formats the minutes and appends the appropriate suffix ('AM' or 'PM').

### Corrected Code

To fix the issue with hour conversion, we need to adjust the code to ensure that hours 13 to 19 are formatted correctly without leading zeros:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = int(s[:2])
        m = s[2:]
        
        # Convert hour to 12-hour format
        if h == 0:
            h_12 = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h_12 = h - 12
        else:
            h_12 = h
        
        # Format hour with leading zero if necessary
        h_str = f"{h_12}"
        
        # Determine AM or PM
        period = "PM" if h >= 12 else "AM"
        
        # Print the result
        print(f"{h_str:02}{m} {period}")

# Call the function
func_1()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to improper handling of hour conversion for PM times. Specifically, it incorrectly adds a leading zero to hours 13 to 19, which violates the requirement to maintain the correct 12-hour format.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
