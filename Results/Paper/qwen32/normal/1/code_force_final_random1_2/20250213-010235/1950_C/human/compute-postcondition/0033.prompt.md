You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string s of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" is processed. The first two characters `h` of `s` are converted to a 12-hour format, and "AM" or "PM" is appended based on whether the original hour is less than 12 or not. After all `t` iterations, all test cases have been processed and their corresponding outputs (in 12-hour format with AM/PM) have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. For each test case, it returns a value indicating whether the time is during the day or night. Specifically, if the time is between 06:00 and 17:59 inclusive, it returns "day"; otherwise, it returns "night".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
