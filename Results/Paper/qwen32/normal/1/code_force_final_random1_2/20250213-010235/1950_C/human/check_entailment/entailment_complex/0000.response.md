### Reasoning:

Let's break down the code and see if it correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including handling edge cases like midnight (`00:00`) and noon (`12:00`).

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the time string `s` in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes:**
   - The hours `h` are extracted from the first two characters of the string `s`.

3. **Converting Hours:**
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it prints `'12'` (midnight).
   - If `h` is between `'01'` and `'12'`, it prints `h` as is.
   - If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it subtracts `12` from the integer value of `h` and formats it to ensure it has two digits (e.g., `09` instead of `9`).

4. **Printing Minutes and Period (AM/PM):**
   - It prints the minutes part `s[2:]` directly.
   - It determines whether to append "AM" or "PM" based on whether `h` is `>= 12`.

### Issues Identified:

- **Incorrect Conversion for Hours Greater Than 12:**
  - When `h` is greater than `'12'`, the code incorrectly formats the hour using `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)`. This will prepend a `'0'` even if the resulting hour is already two digits (e.g., `13` becomes `'01'` instead of `'01'`).
  - Instead, it should use `str(int(h) - 12).zfill(2)` to ensure the hour is always two digits.

- **Handling Noon and Midnight:**
  - The code correctly handles midnight (`'00'` -> `'12 AM'`) and noon (`'12'` -> `'12 PM'`).

### Corrected Code Snippet:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h.zfill(2), end='')  # Ensure two digits for AM hours
        else:
            print(str(int(h) - 12).zfill(2), end='')  # Ensure two digits for PM hours
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

### Conclusion:

The original code has issues with formatting the hour correctly when converting from 24-hour to 12-hour format, particularly for hours greater than 12. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
