Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1440; `s` is the new string input by the user; `h` is the first two characters of the new string `s`. If `h` equals '00', then `h` remains '00'. Otherwise, `h` is not equal to '00' and the integer value of `h` is either less than or equal to 12 or greater than 12.**
