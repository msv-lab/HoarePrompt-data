To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases but does not directly affect the current calculation.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `mn` is defined as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
- It is ensured that `m` is not divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(mn // a + mn // b)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `mn`:**
   - `mn = min(a, b) + m`
   - `min(a, b)` gives the smaller of the two integers `a` and `b`.
   - Adding `m` to this minimum value results in `mn`.

2. **Calculate `mn // a`:**
   - This is the integer division of `mn` by `a`, which means it gives the quotient when `mn` is divided by `a`, discarding any remainder.

3. **Calculate `mn // b`:**
   - Similarly, this is the integer division of `mn` by `b`, giving the quotient when `mn` is divided by `b`, discarding any remainder.

4. **Sum the Results:**
   - The expression `mn // a + mn // b` sums the two quotients obtained from the previous steps.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the sum of the integer divisions of `mn` by `a` and `mn` by `b`.

### Formatted Output:
Given the conditions and the calculations, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **(min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b (where `a`, `b`, and `m` are the input integers)**

This description ensures that the output is precise and reflects the computation performed by the code snippet.
