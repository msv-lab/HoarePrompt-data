Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`, which is not necessarily the point where the maximum number of fireworks overlap. Instead, we need to find a common point in time where the fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously and maximize the overlap.

2. **Handling Overlaps**: The program incorrectly handles the case where `m % a == 0` and `m % b == 0`. This condition alone is not sufficient to determine the maximum overlap. We need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the points where both installations launch fireworks and then calculate the overlaps.

3. **General Case Handling**: The program does not correctly handle all general cases. It needs to consider the LCM of `a` and `b` to find the periodicity of overlapping fireworks and then count how many fireworks from each installation are visible during these periods.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 0
        
        # Check up to lcm_ab because beyond this, the pattern repeats
        for t in range(lcm_ab):
            count = 0
            if t % a <= m:
                count += (m - t % a) // a + 1
            if t % b <= m:
                count += (m - t % b) // b + 1
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, count)
        
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and checks each time within one period of the LCM to determine the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.
