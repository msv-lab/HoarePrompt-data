Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`; `i` is 2. Regardless of whether `m % a == 0` and `m % b == 0` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, `mn`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
