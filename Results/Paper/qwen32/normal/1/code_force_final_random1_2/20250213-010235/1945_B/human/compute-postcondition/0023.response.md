Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `m`. Specifically, it computes a minimum value `mn` as the smaller of `a` and `b` plus `m`, and then determines the output by dividing `mn` by `a` and `b`, adding these results, and possibly adding one more if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without retaining any intermediate values.**
