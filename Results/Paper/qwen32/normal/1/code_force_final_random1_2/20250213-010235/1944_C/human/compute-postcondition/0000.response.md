The given code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `arr`. This `Counter` object, named `nums`, will count the frequency of each element in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. After executing the code, `nums` will be a dictionary-like object where keys are the unique elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts.

Since the exact values of `arr` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact contents of `nums`. However, we know that `nums` will contain the frequency of each integer present in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`; `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr`.**
