### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally according to the rules described.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a `Counter` object `nums` to count the occurrences of each number in the input array `arr`. It also initializes `start` to `0` and a set `vis` to keep track of visited numbers.

2. **Main Loop**: The loop continues as long as the number `start` exists in `nums` (i.e., `nums.get(start, 0)` is not zero). Inside the loop:
   - It adds `start` to the set `vis`.
   - It decrements the count of `start` in `nums`.
   - It checks if `start + 1` exists in `nums`. If it does, it decrements the count of `start + 1` in `nums` and increments `start` by `1`.
   - If `start + 1` does not exist in `nums`, it means the sequence from `0` to `start` is complete, but `start + 1` is missing. Therefore, it prints `start + 1` and exits the loop.

3. **Termination**: If the loop completes without finding a missing number, it prints the current value of `start`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Here's why:

- **Optimal Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to include as many smaller numbers as possible in `c`. Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to prevent Alice from including certain numbers.
- **Counting and Checking**: By counting the occurrences of each number and checking sequentially from `0`, the program effectively simulates the optimal moves of both players. The first number that cannot be included in `c` due to Bob's optimal play is the MEX.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

**Correctness: True**
