### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the resulting array `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the resulting array `c`.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob explicitly. Instead, it uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the array and iteratively finds the smallest integer `k` such that all integers from `0` to `k` are present in the array. If it encounters an integer `k` for which `k+1` is missing, it prints `k+1`.

#### Key Points from Annotations:
- The function `func_1` initializes a `Counter` object to count occurrences of each number in the array.
- It then iterates through numbers starting from `0`, decrementing the count of the current number and the next number if they exist.
- If it finds a number `start` for which `start + 1` is not present in the array, it prints `start + 1` and exits.

#### Evaluation of the Solution:
1. **Game Simulation**: The solution does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob explicitly. However, the logic used implicitly simulates the optimal moves by both players.
   - Alice will always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will also pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.
   
   Since both players are picking the smallest available number, the order in which numbers are picked does not affect the final MEX as long as all numbers from `0` to `k` are picked before `k+1` is encountered.

2. **Optimal Play**: The solution effectively simulates the optimal play by both players. Alice and Bob picking the smallest available number ensures that the smallest possible MEX is achieved after all elements are picked.

3. **Logic Validation**: The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the smallest integer `k` such that all integers from `0` to `k` are present in the array. If `k+1` is missing, it correctly outputs `k+1` as the MEX.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic required to find the MEX of the array after both players have played optimally. The original assessment incorrectly states that the solution does not simulate the turns and does not account for strategic decisions, but the logic inherently handles these aspects.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
