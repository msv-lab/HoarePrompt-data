#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < n, and the length of arr is n where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function will be called multiple times with different arrays, and the sum of all n across these calls does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: `vis` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `k`, `start` is `k`, and the function prints `k + 1` and returns.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the integer value specified in the initial state)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input, where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n` and the length of `arr` is `n`. It processes the list to find the smallest integer `k` such that the integers from `0` to `k` are present in the list in a specific pattern and prints `k + 1`. If the pattern breaks, it prints the current value of `k` and terminates. The function does not return any value.
