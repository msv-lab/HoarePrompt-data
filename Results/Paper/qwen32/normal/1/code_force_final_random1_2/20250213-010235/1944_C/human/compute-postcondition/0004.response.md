Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`; `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0`; `start` is 0; `vis` is a set containing the value `0`.**

In natural language: The variable `vis` now contains the value `0`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
