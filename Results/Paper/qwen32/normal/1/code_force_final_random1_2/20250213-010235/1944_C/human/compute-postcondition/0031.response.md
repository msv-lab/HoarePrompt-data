Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input, where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n` and the length of `arr` is `n`. It processes the list to find the smallest integer `k` such that the integers from `0` to `k` are present in the list in a specific pattern and prints `k + 1`. If the pattern breaks, it prints the current value of `k` and terminates. The function does not return any value.**
