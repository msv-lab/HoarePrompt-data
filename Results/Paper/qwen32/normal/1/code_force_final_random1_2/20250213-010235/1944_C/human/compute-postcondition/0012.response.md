To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head. The loop continues as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy (i.e., greater than 0).

Given the current state:
- `start` is 1.
- `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0.
- `nums[start]` (which is `nums[1]`) has been decreased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `nums.get(start, 0)` must be greater than 0. Since `start` is 1, this means `nums[1]` must be greater than 0.

From the information provided, `nums[1]` has been decreased by 1 from its previous value. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to increase `nums[1]` back to at least 1.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `nums[start]`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0` and `nums[1]` is at least 1. `start` is 1 and `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0. `vis` is a set containing the value `0`.**
