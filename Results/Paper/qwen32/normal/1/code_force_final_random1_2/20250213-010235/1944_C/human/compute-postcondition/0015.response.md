Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0` and `nums[1]` is at least 1, and `nums[1]` has been decremented by 1. `nums[start + 1]` has been further decremented by 1. `start` is 1 and `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0 (before the decrement). `vis` is a set containing the values `0` and `1`.**

Explanation: The value of `nums[start + 1]` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
