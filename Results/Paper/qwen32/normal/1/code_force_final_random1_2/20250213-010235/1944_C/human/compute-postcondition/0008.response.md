Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0` and `nums[1]` is decreased by 1. `start` is 1 and `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0. `vis` is a set containing the value `0`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `start` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
