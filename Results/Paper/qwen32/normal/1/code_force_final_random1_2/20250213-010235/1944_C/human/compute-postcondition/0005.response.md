The code snippet `nums[start] -= 1` decrements the count of the element at index `start` (which is `0`) in the `Counter` object `nums`. Given that `start` is `0` and `nums[0] > 0`, the value of `nums[0]` will decrease by `1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`; `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0` and `nums[0]` is decreased by 1; `start` is 0; `vis` is a set containing the value `0`.**
