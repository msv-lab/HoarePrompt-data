To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while nums.get(start, 0):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue as long as `nums[start]` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums[start]` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`.
- `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0` and `nums[1]` is at least 1.
- If `nums[start + 1]` was greater than 0, then `nums[start + 1]` has been decremented by 1 and `start` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, the program returns nothing (None).
- `vis` is a set containing the values `0` and `1`.

We need to ensure that `nums[start]` is greater than 0. Since `start` could be either 0 or 2 based on the given conditions, we need to consider both possibilities:

1. If `start` is 0, `nums[0]` must be greater than 0. Given that `nums[0] > 0` is already stated, no adjustment is needed for this case.
2. If `start` is 2, `nums[2]` must be greater than 0. We need to ensure that `nums[2]` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Since the problem specifies that `nums[1]` is at least 1 but does not specify anything about `nums[2]`, we need to adjust `nums[2]` to be greater than 0 if `start` is 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `nums[start]` is greater than 0. If `start` is 2, we need to ensure `nums[2]` is greater than 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0`, `nums[1]` is at least 1, and `nums[2]` is greater than 0 if `start` is 2. `vis` is a set containing the values `0` and `1`.**
