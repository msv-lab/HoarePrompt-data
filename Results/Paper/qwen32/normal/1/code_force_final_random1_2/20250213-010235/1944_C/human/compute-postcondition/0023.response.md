The code snippet provided decreases the value of `nums[start + 1]` by 1. Given the initial state, we know that `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr`, and `start` is a variable whose value is included in the set `vis`.

Since `nums[start]` is already decreased by 1 in the initial state, the only change here is the decrement of `nums[start + 1]`. This means the frequency of the element `start + 1` in the `nums` Counter object is reduced by 1.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`; `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0`, `nums[1]` is at least 1, and `nums[2]` is greater than 0 if `start` is 2, and `nums[start + 1]` is decreased by 1; `vis` is a set containing the values `0`, `1`, and `start`.**

In simpler terms, the frequency count of the element `start + 1` in the `nums` Counter object is now one less than it was before executing the code snippet. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
