Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` except `allPlayers[obj]` which is `True` if `el` is '.Q'. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains unchanged. `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals. `points` is `[10, 0]` if `team` is 1 (i.e., `obj[0]` is 'B') and `el` is not '.Q', otherwise `points` is `[0, 10]` if `team` is not 1 and `el` is not '.Q'. If `el` is '.Q', `points` remains `[0, 0]`. `t` must be greater than 0. `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input and the length of `command` is 3. `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`.**
