Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions including `line[ind]` mapped to `(2, ind)`, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 2, and `line` is a list of strings read from standard input that must have at least one element. Additionally, `line[ind]` is not equal to '..'. If `line[ind]` is a player, no further changes are made. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` includes the additional element `(2, ind)`**
