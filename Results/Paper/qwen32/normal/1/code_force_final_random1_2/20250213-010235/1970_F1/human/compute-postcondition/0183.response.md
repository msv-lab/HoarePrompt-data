To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `goalIn(pos)` and what it returns. Since the function `goalIn(pos)` is not defined in the provided context, we'll assume it returns a value indicating whether the position `pos` is within a goal area. For the sake of this example, let's assume `goalIn(pos)` returns `'blue'` if `pos` is in a blue goal area, `'red'` if `pos` is in a red goal area, and `None` if `pos` is not in any goal area.

Given this assumption, here's the updated output state:

If `goalIn(pos)` returns `'blue'`:
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` including `allPlayers[obj]` which is now `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, `points` is `[0, 0]` unless specified otherwise, `t` must be greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`, `time` is `current_time + 1`, `pos` is `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `team` is `'blue'`.**

If `goalIn(pos)` returns `'red'`:
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` including `allPlayers[obj]` which is now `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, `points` is `[0, 0]` unless specified otherwise, `t` must be greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`, `time` is `current_time + 1`, `pos` is `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `team` is `'red'`.**

If `goalIn(pos)` returns `None`:
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` including `allPlayers[obj]` which is now `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, `points` is `[0, 0]` unless specified otherwise, `t` must be greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`, `time` is `current_time + 1`, `pos` is `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `team` is `None`.**

Since the exact return value of `goalIn(pos)` is not specified, the output state includes all three possibilities.
