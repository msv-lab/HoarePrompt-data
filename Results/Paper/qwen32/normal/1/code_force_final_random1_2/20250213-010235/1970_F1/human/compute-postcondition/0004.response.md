Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the grid (N lines and M columns); `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, now `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1)}`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping player identifiers to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle, now `allPlayers` is `{}`; `goal` is a list of lists, where `goal[0]` contains tuples representing the positions of blue goals and `goal[1]` contains tuples representing the positions of red goals, now `goal` is `[[], []]`; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams, respectively.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the `goal` variable is now an empty list of lists, i.e., `[[], []]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
