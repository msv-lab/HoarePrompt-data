Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` includes an additional element `(i, ind)`.**
