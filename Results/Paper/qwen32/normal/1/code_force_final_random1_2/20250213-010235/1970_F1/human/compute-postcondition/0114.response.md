To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `time`: This variable is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, it is expected to be an integer representing some time value.
   - `GoalName`: This dictionary is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but based on the context, it likely maps team identifiers to goal names. Given that `team` is either 0 or 1, `GoalName[team]` would refer to the goal name for the respective team.
   - `team`: This variable is determined based on the first character of `obj`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `obj`: This is the first element of the `command` list, which is a list of three strings. The exact value of `obj` is not specified, so we need to consider both possibilities for `team`.

2. **Determine the value of `team`:**
   - Since `obj` is not explicitly given, we have two cases:
     - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `team` is 0.

3. **Determine the value of `GoalName[team]`:**
   - Assuming `GoalName` is a dictionary that maps team identifiers to goal names, we need to know the specific mappings. Since this information is not provided, we will denote the goal names as `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]`.

4. **Construct the output:**
   - The `print` statement formats the output as `'%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team])`.
   - Therefore, the output will be a string that includes the value of `time`, followed by the goal name for the respective team, and the phrase "CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH".

Given the lack of specific values for `time` and the exact mappings in `GoalName`, we can provide a general form of the output:

- If `team` is 1, the output will be `'%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[1])`.
- If `team` is 0, the output will be `'%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[0])`.

Since we don't have the exact values for `time` and the mappings in `GoalName`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **time GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where time is the value of the time variable and GoalName[team] is the goal name for the respective team)**
