Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Upon reviewing the provided code, there are several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling of Commands**:
   - The code incorrectly handles the command `C` (catching the Quaffle). It only checks if the element to be caught is `.Q`, but it should handle the case where the player catches the Quaffle (`el == '.Q'`). However, there is a mistake in the code where it checks for `.S` (which is not mentioned in the problem description) instead of `.Q`.
   - The code also incorrectly handles the command `T` (throwing the Quaffle). After throwing the Quaffle, the Quaffle should be moved to the middle of the field, but the code does not update the position of the Quaffle in the `elements` dictionary.

2. **Goal Scoring Logic**:
   - The code checks if the Quaffle is in a goal using the `goalIn` function, but it does not differentiate between scoring in the correct goal or the wrong goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in their own goal, the other team should get the point.

3. **Movement Logic**:
   - The code does not correctly update the position of the Quaffle when it is carried by a player. When a player moves, the Quaffle should also move if the player is carrying it.

4. **Initialization and Global Variables**:
   - The code uses global variables like `goal`, `points`, and `mov` without defining them within the function or passing them as parameters. This can lead to undefined behavior if these variables are not properly initialized elsewhere in the code.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple players or goals are present in the same cell, although the problem description guarantees that each pair of characters is unique.
   - The code does not handle the case where a player tries to throw the Quaffle without carrying it, although the problem description guarantees that all actions are valid.

Given these issues, the code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description and fails to handle certain scenarios correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
