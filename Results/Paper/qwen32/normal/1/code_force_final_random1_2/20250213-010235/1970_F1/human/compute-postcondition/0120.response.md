To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet within the context of the initial state provided.

Given Code:
```python
nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
```

This line calculates a new position `nxt` based on the current position `pos` and the movement vector specified by `mov[com]`.

### Analysis:
- `pos` is the current position of `obj` as retrieved from `elements`. Let's denote `pos` as `(x, y)`.
- `mov` is a dictionary that maps commands to movement vectors. For example, `mov['up']` might be `(-1, 0)` indicating moving one unit up.
- `com` is the command string, which specifies the direction of movement.
- `mov[com]` retrieves the movement vector corresponding to the command `com`. Let's denote this as `(dx, dy)`.
- The new position `nxt` is calculated as `(x + dx, y + dy)`.

### Output State:
The only variable that changes is `nxt`, which is now calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `t`, `command`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`) remain unchanged.

### Natural Language Description:
The new position `nxt` is calculated by adding the movement vector specified by `mov[com]` to the current position `pos`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, and `points` is `[0, 0]`; `t` must be greater than 0; `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input with a length of 2; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `pos` is the position of `obj` as retrieved from `elements`; `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.**
