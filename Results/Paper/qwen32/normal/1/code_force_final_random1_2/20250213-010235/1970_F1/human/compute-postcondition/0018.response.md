Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1), line[ind]: (i, ind)}`, `allPlayers` is `{}`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, and `line[ind]` is not a player. If `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, then `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[0]` if `tmp` is `0` (which occurs when `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`), or to `goal[1]` if `tmp` is `1` (which occurs when `line[ind][0]` is not `'B'`).**
