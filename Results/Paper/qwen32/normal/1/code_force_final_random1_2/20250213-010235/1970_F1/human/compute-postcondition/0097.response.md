The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list at index `tmp` of the `goal` list. Given that `tmp` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition `line[4][0]` being 'B' or not, and `i` is 2 and `ind` is 4, the tuple `(2, 4)` will be appended to either `goal[0]` or `goal[1]`.

Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `goal`, we can only say that `goal[tmp]` will now include the tuple `(2, 4)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions including `line[4]` mapped to `(2, 4)`, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings read from standard input that must have at least one element, and `ind` is 4; `tmp` is 0 if `line[4][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(2, 4)`**.
