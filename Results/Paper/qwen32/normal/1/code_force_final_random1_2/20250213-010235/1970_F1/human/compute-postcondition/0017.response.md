The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given that `tmp` is `0` if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` and `1` otherwise, the tuple `(i, ind)` will be added to either `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` based on the value of `tmp`.

Since `tmp` is either `0` or `1`, the list `goal[tmp]` will have the new element `(i, ind)` appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1), line[ind]: (i, ind)}`, `allPlayers` is `{}`, `goal` is `[[], []]` with `(i, ind)` appended to `goal[0]` if `tmp` is `0` or to `goal[1]` if `tmp` is `1`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, and `line[ind]` is not a player. Additionally, `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`. `tmp` is `0` if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, otherwise `tmp` is `1`.**
