The code assigns the value `0` to `tmp` if the first character of `line[ind]` is `'B'`; otherwise, it assigns `1` to `tmp`. The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `line`, and `elements[line[ind]]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1.**
