Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from standard input that must have at least one element, `ind` is 2. If `line[2]` is not '..', it is added to `elements` with the position `(1, 2)`. If `line[2]` is a player, `allPlayers` remains unchanged. If `line[2]` is not a player and `line[2][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is either 0 or 1 based on whether `line[2][0]` is 'B' or not, and `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(1, 2)`**
