Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, `points` is `[10, 0]` if `team` is 1, otherwise `points` is `[0, 10]`. `t` must be greater than 0. `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input and the length of `command` is 3. `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. `el` is equal to '.S'. `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `points[team]` is incremented by 10. Since `team` is determined by whether `obj[0]` is 'B' (making `team` equal to 1) or not (making `team` equal to 0), the points for the respective team are updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
