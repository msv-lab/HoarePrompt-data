The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `tmp` if the first character of `line[ind]` is `'B'`; otherwise, it assigns `1` to `tmp`. Given that `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, the value of `line[ind]` could be something like `'BG'` or `'RG'`. However, the exact value of `line[ind]` is not specified beyond its second character being `'G'`.

Since `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, the only relevant part is the first character to determine the value of `tmp`. 

If `line[ind]` starts with `'B'`, `tmp` becomes `0`. Otherwise, `tmp` becomes `1`.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1), line[ind]: (i, ind)}`, `allPlayers` is `{}`, `goal` is `[[], []]`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, and `line[ind]` is not a player. Additionally, `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`. `tmp` is `0` if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, otherwise `tmp` is `1`.**
