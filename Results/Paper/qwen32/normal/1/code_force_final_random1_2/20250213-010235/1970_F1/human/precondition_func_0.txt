n and m are integers representing the dimensions of the grid (N lines and M columns), where 3 <= n <= 99 and 3 <= m <= 99. grid is a 2D list of strings representing the field, where each string is either '..' for an empty cell, 'R0', ..., 'R9', 'B0', ..., 'B9' for players, 'RG' or 'BG' for goals, or '.Q' for the Quaffle. elements is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid. allPlayers is a dictionary mapping player identifiers to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle. goal is a list of lists, where goal[0] contains tuples representing the positions of blue goals and goal[1] contains tuples representing the positions of red goals. points is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams, respectively.
