Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` including `allPlayers[obj]` which is now `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, `t` must be greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`. When `len(command) != 3`, `pos` is the position of `obj` as retrieved from `elements`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B` and the element at `nxt` in `grid` is a player, then `player` is assigned the value of the element at `nxt` in `grid` and `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is not `.B`, no changes are made to `elements` or `player`. `time` is `current_time + 1`. If `goalIn(pos) != -1`, then `points[team]` is incremented by 1, where `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.**
