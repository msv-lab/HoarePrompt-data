The given code snippet attempts to increment the score for a team stored in the `points` list using the index `team`. However, the variable `team` is initialized to `None`, which would raise an error if the code were actually executed because `points[None]` is invalid.

Since the task requires us to simulate the execution and provide the output state, we'll assume that the intention was to update the points for a specific team, but since `team` is `None`, no actual change occurs in the `points` list.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the fact that we acknowledge the attempt to modify `points`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` including `allPlayers[obj]` which is now `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`, `time` is `current_time + 1`, `pos` is `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `team` is `None`.**
