You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the dimensions of the grid (N lines and M columns), where 3 <= n <= 99 and 3 <= m <= 99. grid is a 2D list of strings representing the field, where each string is either '..' for an empty cell, 'R0', ..., 'R9', 'B0', ..., 'B9' for players, 'RG' or 'BG' for goals, or '.Q' for the Quaffle. elements is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid. allPlayers is a dictionary mapping player identifiers to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle. goal is a list of lists, where goal[0] contains tuples representing the positions of blue goals and goal[1] contains tuples representing the positions of red goals. points is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams, respectively.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())

    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, and `points` is `[0, 0]`.

                ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
                player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
                print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))

    #State: `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged unless modified by commands, `elements` reflects final positions, `allPlayers` reflects active players, `goal` is unchanged, `points` reflects accumulated points, `t` is unchanged.
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: points[0] points[1] (where points[0] is the accumulated points for the first player and points[1] is the accumulated points for the second player)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of the grid, `grid` which is a 2D list of strings representing the field, `elements` which is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, `allPlayers` which is a dictionary mapping player identifiers to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle, `goal` which is a list of lists containing the positions of blue and red goals, and `points` which is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams, respectively. The function does not explicitly return any value, but it likely modifies the game state based on the provided parameters.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
