The given code snippet reads a line from standard input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `line`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, or `i`.

Therefore, the only change is that `line` now holds the new list of strings read from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `goal` contains positions of 'G' elements categorized by prefix ('B' or not), `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, `line` is the list of strings read from standard input.**
