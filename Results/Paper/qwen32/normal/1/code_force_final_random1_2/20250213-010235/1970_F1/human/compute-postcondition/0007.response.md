The code reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and then splits the line into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This list is assigned to the variable `line`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `line`, which now holds the list of substrings read from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1)}`, `allPlayers` is `{}`, `goal` is `[[], []]`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `line` is a list of substrings from the input.**
