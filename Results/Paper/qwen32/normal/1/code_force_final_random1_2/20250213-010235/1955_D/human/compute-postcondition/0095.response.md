The code snippet `b_values = set(b)` creates a set named `b_values` containing unique elements from the list `b`. This operation does not affect the other variables (`cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`) except for introducing the new variable `b_values`.

Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is the count of that element in the first `m` elements of `b`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `m`; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.**
