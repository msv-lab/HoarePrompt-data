The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the dictionary `cnt_b`. Given the initial state, `i` is `m + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 1`.

Thus, the count of `a[m + 1]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `i` is `m + 1`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `cnt_b` has the count of `a[m + 1]` incremented by 1, `curr` remains unchanged, `ans` remains 0**.
