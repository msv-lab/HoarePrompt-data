Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `i` is `m`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, `cnt_b` remains unchanged and `ans` remains 0. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1.**
