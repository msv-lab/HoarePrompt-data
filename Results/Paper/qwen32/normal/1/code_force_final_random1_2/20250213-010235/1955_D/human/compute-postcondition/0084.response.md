In this case, the loop head contains only the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The underscore `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use, and `int(input())` determines the number of iterations the loop will run.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, there's no specific variable like `i` or `index` that needs to be incremented or modified directly. Instead, the loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` has not been reached yet.

Since the loop does not modify or depend on any specific variable in its head other than the iteration count, the state of `cnt_b` remains unchanged. The only thing that would change is the implicit iteration count, but since we don't have direct access to that, we can infer that the loop will execute one more time if the initial input was greater than the current iteration number.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be the same as the end of the previous iteration regarding `cnt_b`.

State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is `0`.**
