The code increments the value of `curr` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `curr` will be the previous value of `curr` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `curr` was initially set to 2 if `a[1]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, otherwise `curr` was set to 1, after the increment, `curr` will be 3 or 2 respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` being at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b` with the count of `a[2]` decreased by 1 if `a[2]` is in `b_values`; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `i` is 2; `curr` is 3 if `a[1]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, otherwise `curr` is 2.**
