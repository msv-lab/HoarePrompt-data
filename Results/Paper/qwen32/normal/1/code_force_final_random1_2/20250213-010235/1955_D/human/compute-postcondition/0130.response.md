Postcondition: **`cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if its original value was greater than or equal to 0; `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement; `n` is greater than `m`; `m` and `k` remain unchanged; `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `i` is `m`; `b_values` remains unchanged; `ans` is 1 if the new value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
