Postcondition: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`. `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**
