The given code snippet only initializes a new variable `curr` to 0. None of the existing variables (`cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `b_values`, `ans`) are modified.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the addition of the new variable `curr`.

Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is the count of that element in the first `m` elements of `b`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `m`; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0.**
