Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `i` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` becomes greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.**
