Postcondition: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is the count of that element in the first `m` elements of `b`. `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, and `k` are integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0. Additionally, `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
