The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increase its value by 1 again to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1**

Adjusted State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1; `i` is 4** (assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration)

General State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1**

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1**

Specifically, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1; `i` is 4**
