The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over `b_values`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration.

Given that `cnt_b[i]` is `0` at the end of the previous iteration, it indicates that the current value of `i` from `b_values` has been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should take the next value from `b_values`.

Since `b_values` is a non-empty iterable, we assume that there is at least one more element in `b_values` after the current `i`. Therefore, `i` should be updated to the next value in `b_values`.

State: **`b_values` must be a non-empty iterable; `cnt_b[i]` is `0`; `i` is the next value in `b_values`**.

However, since we cannot specify the exact next value without knowing the contents of `b_values`, we can simply state that `i` takes the next value from `b_values`.

State: **`b_values` must be a non-empty iterable; `i` is the next value in `b_values`**.
