The given code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. This action does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is the count of that element in the first `m` elements of `b`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `m`; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0.**
