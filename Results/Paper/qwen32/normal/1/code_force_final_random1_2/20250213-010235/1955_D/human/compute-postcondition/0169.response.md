The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables (`a`, `cnt_b`, `i`, `ans`, `curr`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b_values`). 

Therefore, the only change is that `b` is now a list of integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers provided by the user input; `cnt_b` reflects the counts of elements from `b` in the last `m` elements of the original `a` except `cnt_b[i]` which is now 0 for every `i` in `b_values`; `i` is the last element of `b_values`; `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was `>= k` during the loop; `curr` is the count of elements in the last `m` elements of the original `a` that are in `b` and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`; `n`, `m`, `k` are the input integers; `b_values` remains unchanged; `b` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**
