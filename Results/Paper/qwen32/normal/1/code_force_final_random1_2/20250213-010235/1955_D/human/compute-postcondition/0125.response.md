Postcondition: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`. If `a[m]` is in `b_values`, the count of `a[m]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1. If the count of `a[m]` in `cnt_b` was greater than 0 before the increment, `curr` is the previous value of `curr` minus 1. `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `m`, `b_values` remains unchanged. `ans` is 1 if the new value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 0. If `a[m]` is not in `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `b_values` remain unchanged.**
