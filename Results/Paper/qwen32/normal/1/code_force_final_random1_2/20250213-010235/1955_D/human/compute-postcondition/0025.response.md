Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` being at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b` with the count of `a[1]` decreased by 1; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `i` is 1; `curr` is 2 if `a[1]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[1]` was in `b_values`, `curr` was initially 1 and is now 2. If `a[1]` was not in `b_values`, `curr` was initially 0 and is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
