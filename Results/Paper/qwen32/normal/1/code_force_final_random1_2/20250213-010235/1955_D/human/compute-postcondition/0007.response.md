The code snippet `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. 

Given the initial state, `cnt_b` is presumably a dictionary that keeps track of counts of elements from list `b`. After executing the line of code, the count of the element `b[i]` in `cnt_b` will be increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
