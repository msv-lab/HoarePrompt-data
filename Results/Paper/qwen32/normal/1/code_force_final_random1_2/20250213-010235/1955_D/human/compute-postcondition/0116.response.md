Postcondition: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`. `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. `a` and `b` remain unchanged. `i` is `m`. `b_values` remains unchanged. `ans` remains 0. `curr` is the total number of elements from `a` within the first `m` elements that are also in `b` and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`. Additionally, `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
