Postcondition: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`, and the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decremented by 1; `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `b_values` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, `curr` is incremented by 1.**
