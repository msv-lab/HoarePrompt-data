The code snippet `curr -= 1` decrements the value of `curr` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `m`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, `curr` is decreased by 1.**
