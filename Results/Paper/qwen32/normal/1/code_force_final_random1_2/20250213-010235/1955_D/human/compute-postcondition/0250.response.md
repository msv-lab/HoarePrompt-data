Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers and two additional integers. For each test case, it determines how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in the first list contain at least `k` elements that also appear in the second list. It then prints the count of such subarrays for each test case.**
