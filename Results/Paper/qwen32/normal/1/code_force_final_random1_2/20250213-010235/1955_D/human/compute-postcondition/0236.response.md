Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `i` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `curr` remain unchanged.**
