To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is just `i` in this case.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `m`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `m + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cnt_b`, `b_values`, `curr`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based solely on the loop's iteration logic.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers with `n > m`; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b` minus the number of times it appeared in `a` (only if it was present in `b`). `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `i` is `m + 1`; `curr` is the total number of elements from `a` that were found in `b` and had non-negative counts in `cnt_b`, adjusted by decrementing if `a[i + m]` was in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement, and incremented if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` (after adjustments) is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 3; otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.**
