Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`, and the count of `a[m + 2]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `m`; `m` and `k` remain unchanged; `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `i` is `m + 1`; `b_values` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `curr` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `m + 2` to `m + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
