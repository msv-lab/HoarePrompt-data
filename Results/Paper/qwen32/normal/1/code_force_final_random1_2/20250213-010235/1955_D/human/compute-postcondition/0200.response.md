Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `cnt_b` reflects decremented counts for elements in `b_values` found in the first `m` elements of `a`, `i` is `m-1`, `n`, `m`, `k` remain unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
