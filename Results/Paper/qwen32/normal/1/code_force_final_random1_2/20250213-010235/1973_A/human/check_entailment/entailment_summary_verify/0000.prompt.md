You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`. Each tuple contains three integers representing scores of three players. It evaluates each tuple based on specific rules and returns a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the result of evaluating one tuple. If the conditions are not met for a tuple, it appends `-1` to the result list; otherwise, it calculates and appends the number of equal matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness according to the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that `p1 <= p2 <= p3`. The total points from all games must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (if there's a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if it's a draw).

### Provided Program Analysis

Here's the provided program:

```python
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Test Case in Input**:
   - The test case `(0, 2, 3)` is invalid because `p2` should always be greater than or equal to `p1` and `p3` should always be greater than or equal to `p2`. Hence, this test case should be `(0, 0, 3)` or `(0, 2, 2)` or something similar to be valid.
   
2. **Logic Errors**:
   - The condition `total_matchs > 3` is incorrect. The maximum number of matches is not limited to 3. For example, if `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 0`, and `p3 = 6`, the maximum number of matches is 6.
   - The calculation of `egalites` seems incorrect. The formula used doesn't accurately reflect the maximum number of draws possible.

### Correctness Check

Given these issues, let's verify if the program works correctly for valid test cases:

- **Test Case (0, 0, 0)**: Correct, no games played, so 0 draws.
- **Test Case (0, 1, 1)**: Correct, one draw between the second and third player.
- **Test Case (1, 1, 2)**: Correct, two draws.
- **Test Case (3, 3, 3)**: Incorrect, the program returns `-1` but it's possible to have 3 draws.
- **Test Case (3, 4, 5)**: Incorrect, the program returns `6` which is not possible.
- **Test Case (1, 1, 10)**: Incorrect, the program returns `2` which is not possible.
- **Test Case (0, 0, 6)**: Incorrect, the program returns `-1` but it's possible to have 6 draws.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles several test cases and has logical errors in calculating the maximum number of draws.
