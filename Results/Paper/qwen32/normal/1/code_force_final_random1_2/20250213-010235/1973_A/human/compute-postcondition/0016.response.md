The code appends the value of `egalites // 2` to the `resultats` list. Given the initial state, `resultats` could either be `[-1]` or `[]` depending on the conditions checked before the code snippet. After appending `egalites // 2`, `resultats` will no longer be `[-1]` unless the condition `total_matchs > 3` or `p_3 > total_matchs` was true, in which case `-1` would already be the only element.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple. `total_points` is `p_1 + p_2 + p_3` from the first tuple in `cas_de_test`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is `[-1]`. Otherwise, `resultats` is initially an empty list and contains the single element `-1` if `total_matchs > 3` or `p_3 > total_matchs`; otherwise, `resultats` is `[egalites // 2]`. `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)` and is greater than or equal to 0.**

In simpler terms: The `resultats` list now includes `egalites // 2` unless it was already `[-1]` due to previous conditions. All other variables remain unchanged.
