The code snippet calculates the sum of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the first tuple in the `cas_de_test` list and assigns this sum to the variable `total_points`. However, the code does not specify which tuple from the list to use, so we assume it uses the first tuple in the list. 

Given that `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, we can denote the first tuple as `(p_1, p_2, p_3)`. Therefore, `total_points` will be calculated as `p_1 + p_2 + p_3`.

Since the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are part of the precondition, they remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `total_points`, which is the sum of these three values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `resultats` is an empty list, `total_points` is `p_1 + p_2 + p_3` from the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.**
