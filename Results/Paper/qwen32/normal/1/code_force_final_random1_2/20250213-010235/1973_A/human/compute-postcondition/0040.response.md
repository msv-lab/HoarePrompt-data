The code calculates the value of `egalites` using the formula provided. The values of `total_points`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are used in this calculation. No other variables are modified.

Given the formula:
\[ \text{egalites} = \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p2}) - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p1}) \]

We can express `egalites` directly in terms of the existing variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple (excluding the one just processed); `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` now includes `-1` as its last element; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` > 3 or `p3` > `total_matchs`, `resultats` includes `-1` as its last element; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`**.
