Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total points scored by all three players (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - Since each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser, or 1 to each in case of a draw), `total_points` must be even. If not, the program correctly appends `-1` to the results list.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches played (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`).
   - It checks if `total_matchs > 3`. This check seems incorrect because there is no inherent limit on the number of matches that can be played among three players. The maximum number of matches is determined by the points distribution, not an arbitrary number like 3. Therefore, this condition should be removed or corrected.
   - It also checks if `p3 > total_matchs`. This condition is also incorrect because `p3` represents the highest score, which can indeed be greater than the total number of matches if there are draws. For example, if all games end in draws, each player can have a score of 2, and `p3` would be 2, but `total_matchs` would be 3 (if three games were played). Therefore, this condition should be removed or corrected.

3. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula attempts to account for the points that come from wins and subtracts them from the total points to find the points that come from draws. However, this formula does not correctly account for the distribution of points among the players. For instance, it does not ensure that the calculated number of draws is feasible given the scores.
   - The program then checks if `egalites < 0`. If it is, the program appends `-1` to the results list, indicating an invalid score distribution.
   - If `egalites >= 0`, the program calculates the number of draws as `egalites // 2` and appends this value to the results list.

### Conclusion:
The program contains several logical errors in its conditions and calculations. Specifically, the conditions checking `total_matchs > 3` and `p3 > total_matchs` are incorrect and lead to false negatives. Additionally, the formula used to calculate the number of draws does not correctly handle all possible score distributions.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
