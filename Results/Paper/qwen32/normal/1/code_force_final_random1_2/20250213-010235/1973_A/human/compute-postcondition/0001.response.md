To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `cas_de_test`, which is a list of tuples.

Here's the breakdown:

- The loop variable `(p1, p2, p3)` will take on the values of each tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- For the loop to execute, `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30.
- `resultats` is an empty list.

The only state that needs adjustment is `cas_de_test` to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `resultats` is an empty list**.
