To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the entire list of tuples `cas_de_test` and apply the logic defined in the loop to each tuple. The loop processes each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test` and appends a value to the `resultats` list based on the conditions provided.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic applied to each tuple:

1. **Calculate `total_points`:** Sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
2. **Check if `total_points` is odd:** If yes, append `-1` to `resultats` and move to the next tuple.
3. **Calculate `total_matchs`:** Integer division of `total_points` by 2.
4. **Check if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`:** If yes, append `-1` to `resultats` and move to the next tuple.
5. **Calculate `egalites`:** Formula `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
6. **Check if `egalites < 0`:** If yes, append `-1` to `resultats`. Otherwise, append `egalites // 2` to `resultats`.

After processing all tuples in `cas_de_test`, the final state of `resultats` will be the output state.

Since the problem statement does not provide the specific contents of `cas_de_test`, we can't compute the exact values in `resultats`. However, we can describe the final state in terms of the process applied to each tuple.

**Output State:** **`resultats` is a list containing the results of processing each tuple in `cas_de_test` according to the described logic.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has processed every tuple in the `cas_de_test` list, the `resultats` list will contain a series of integers, each representing the outcome of the corresponding tuple's evaluation. Each integer in `resultats` is either `-1` (indicating an invalid match scenario) or a non-negative integer representing the number of matches that ended in a draw.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`resultats` is a list of integers derived from evaluating each tuple in `cas_de_test` according to the specified rules.**
