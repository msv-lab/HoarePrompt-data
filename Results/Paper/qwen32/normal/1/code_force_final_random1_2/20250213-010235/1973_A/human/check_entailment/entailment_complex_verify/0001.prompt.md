You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:

cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]

        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Annotated Code: 
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and cas_de_test is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. Each tuple represents the scores of the three players for a single test case.
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)

            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
        
    #State: `resultats` is a list of integers derived from evaluating each tuple in `cas_de_test` according to the specified rules.
    return resultats
    #The program returns the list `resultats` which contains integers derived from evaluating each tuple in `cas_de_test` according to the specified rules.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`. Each tuple contains three integers representing scores of three players. It evaluates each tuple based on specific rules and returns a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the result of evaluating one tuple. If the conditions are not met for a tuple, it appends `-1` to the result list; otherwise, it calculates and appends the number of equal matches.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total points scored by all three players (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - Since each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser, or 1 to each in case of a draw), `total_points` must be even. If not, the program correctly appends `-1` to the results list.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches played (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`).
   - It checks if `total_matchs > 3`. This check seems incorrect because there is no inherent limit on the number of matches that can be played among three players. The maximum number of matches is determined by the points distribution, not an arbitrary number like 3. Therefore, this condition should be removed or corrected.
   - It also checks if `p3 > total_matchs`. This condition is also incorrect because `p3` represents the highest score, which can indeed be greater than the total number of matches if there are draws. For example, if all games end in draws, each player can have a score of 2, and `p3` would be 2, but `total_matchs` would be 3 (if three games were played). Therefore, this condition should be removed or corrected.

3. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula attempts to account for the points that come from wins and subtracts them from the total points to find the points that come from draws. However, this formula does not correctly account for the distribution of points among the players. For instance, it does not ensure that the calculated number of draws is feasible given the scores.
   - The program then checks if `egalites < 0`. If it is, the program appends `-1` to the results list, indicating an invalid score distribution.
   - If `egalites >= 0`, the program calculates the number of draws as `egalites // 2` and appends this value to the results list.

### Conclusion:
The program contains several logical errors in its conditions and calculations. Specifically, the conditions checking `total_matchs > 3` and `p3 > total_matchs` are incorrect and lead to false negatives. Additionally, the formula used to calculate the number of draws does not correctly handle all possible score distributions.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.
