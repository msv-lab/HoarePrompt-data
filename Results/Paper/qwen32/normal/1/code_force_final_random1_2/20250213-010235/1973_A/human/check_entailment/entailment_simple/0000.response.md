Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Points Distribution**: 
   - Winner gets 2 points.
   - Loser gets 0 points.
   - In case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
   
2. **Constraints**:
   - Scores are non-decreasing: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
   - Total points must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (if there's a winner) or 2 points (if it's a draw).

3. **Objective**:
   - Determine the maximum number of draws possible given the scores.
   - Return `-1` if the scores cannot be achieved through a valid set of games.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program first checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even. If not, it immediately appends `-1` to the results list, which is correct because an odd total points sum cannot be achieved with the given scoring system.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The total number of matches is calculated as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points.

3. **Feasibility Checks**:
   - The program checks if `total_matches > 3` or `p3 > total_matches`. These checks ensure that the scores are feasible:
     - No more than 3 matches can happen among 3 players.
     - Player 3's score cannot exceed the total number of matches.
   - If either condition fails, `-1` is appended to the results list.

4. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{draws} = \frac{\text{total\_points} - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p2}) - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p1})}{2}
     \]
   - This formula attempts to account for the points contributed by wins and losses, leaving the remainder as points from draws.
   - If the calculated number of draws is negative, it means the scores are inconsistent, and `-1` is appended.

### Testing the Program with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case (0, 0, 0)**:
   - Total points: 0 (even).
   - Total matches: 0.
   - Draws: 0.
   - Result: 0 (correct).

2. **Test Case (0, 1, 1)**:
   - Total points: 2 (even).
   - Total matches: 1.
   - Draws: 1.
   - Result: 1 (correct).

3. **Test Case (1, 1, 1)**:
   - Total points: 3 (odd).
   - Result: -1 (correct).

4. **Test Case (1, 1, 2)**:
   - Total points: 4 (even).
   - Total matches: 2.
   - Draws: 2.
   - Result: 2 (correct).

5. **Test Case (3, 3, 3)**:
   - Total points: 9 (odd).
   - Result: -1 (correct).

6. **Test Case (3, 4, 5)**:
   - Total points: 12 (even).
   - Total matches: 6.
   - Draws: 6.
   - Result: 6 (correct).

7. **Test Case (1, 1, 10)**:
   - Total points: 12 (even).
   - Total matches: 6.
   - Draws: 2.
   - Result: 2 (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the provided test cases and adheres to the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
