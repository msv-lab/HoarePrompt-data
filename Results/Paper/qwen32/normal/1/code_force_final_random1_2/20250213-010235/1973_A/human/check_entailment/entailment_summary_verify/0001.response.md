Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the original assessment based on the provided problem description, the code, and the function summary.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total points scored by all three players (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It correctly checks if `total_points` is even. If not, it appends `-1` because an odd total points cannot be achieved with the given scoring rules (each game contributes 2 points).

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches played (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`).
   - It then checks if `total_matchs > 3` and if `p3 > total_matchs`. These checks are indeed problematic:
     - There is no inherent limit on the number of matches that can be played among three players. The maximum number of matches is determined by the points distribution, not an arbitrary number like 3.
     - The condition `p3 > total_matchs` is incorrect because `p3` represents the highest score, which can indeed be greater than the total number of matches if there are draws. For example, if all games end in draws, each player can have a score of 2, and `p3` would be 2, but `total_matchs` would be 3 (if three games were played).

3. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula attempts to account for the points that come from wins and subtracts them from the total points to find the points that come from draws. However, this formula does not correctly account for the distribution of points among the players. For instance, it does not ensure that the calculated number of draws is feasible given the scores.
   - The program then checks if `egalites < 0`. If it is, the program appends `-1` to the results list, indicating an invalid score distribution.
   - If `egalites >= 0`, the program calculates the number of draws as `egalites // 2` and appends this value to the results list.

### Correctness of the Program:

The original assessment correctly identifies several logical errors in the program. Specifically, the conditions `total_matchs > 3` and `p3 > total_matchs` are incorrect and lead to false negatives. Additionally, the formula used to calculate the number of draws does not correctly handle all possible score distributions.

Given these issues, the program is not correct. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these problems.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
