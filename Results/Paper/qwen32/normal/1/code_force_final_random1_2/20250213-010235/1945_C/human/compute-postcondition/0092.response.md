Postcondition: **`mini` is 100000000, `final` is a list containing `n`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `lst` is an empty list, `zero` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0', otherwise `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50.**
