Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the value of the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` (which is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` (which is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50; otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged; `mini` is 100000000; the current character `s[i]` is such that `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and 0 otherwise; `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', and 0 otherwise; `i` is 4; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 5`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is '1', `one` is incremented by 1.**
