Postcondition: **`final` is [0, 1], but the length of `final` is 0**.

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the given example since the precondition states that `final` is `[0, 1]`, which means its length is 2, not 0. Given the if condition `(len(final) == 0)`, the code inside the if block would not execute because the precondition contradicts the if condition. Nonetheless, if we were to strictly follow the instruction to include both the precondition and the if condition in the postcondition, it would look like the above statement. 

To clarify, typically, the code inside the if block would not run with the given precondition, as the length of `final` cannot be both 2 and 0 simultaneously.
