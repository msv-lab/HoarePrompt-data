The code appends `elem` to the list `final`. Since `final` initially contains `elem` only if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, and now `elem` is appended regardless of this condition, `final` will definitely include `elem` after the operation.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing `elem` (and possibly other elements that previously satisfied `abs(pk - elem) == mini`); `lst` has at least one element; `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**
