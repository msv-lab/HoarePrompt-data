Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `final` is a list containing `n`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list, `zero` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0', otherwise `one` is incremented by 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `one_perc` is recalculated using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
