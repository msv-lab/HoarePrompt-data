The code assigns the value of `n / 2` to the variable `pk`. Given that `n` is an even integer, `pk` will also be an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the new input integer and `n` is even; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the value of the user's input; `pk` is `n / 2`.**
