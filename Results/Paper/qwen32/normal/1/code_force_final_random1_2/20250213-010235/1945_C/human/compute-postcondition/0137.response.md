The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Initially, `final` is described as `[0, 1]`, but its length is stated as 0, which seems contradictory. Given the context, we'll assume `final` starts as an empty list `[]`.

After appending `n`, `final` will be `[n]`. The values of `c1` and its condition (`c1` is less than 50) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final` is `[n]`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `c1` is less than 50**.
