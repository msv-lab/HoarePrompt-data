The code appends `elem` to the list `final`. The values of `mini` and `lst` remain unchanged. The new state of `final` includes `elem` as its last element.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, otherwise `final` contains its previous elements plus `elem`; `lst` has at least one element; `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**
