The code snippet provided counts the number of '0's in the list `sl`, which is derived from the input string `s`. This count is stored in the new variable `z`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State includes the new variable `z` with its calculated value, while all other variables retain their initial states as described.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; if `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing one element, `[0]`, otherwise, `final` is a list containing `n`; if `len(final) != 0`, then `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`.**
