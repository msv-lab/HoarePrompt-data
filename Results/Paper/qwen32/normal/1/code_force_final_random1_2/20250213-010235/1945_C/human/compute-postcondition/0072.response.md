In this task, the loop head only contains the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable used for iterating `t` times. Therefore, the state of `_` does not need to be explicitly adjusted because it is automatically managed by the `range(t)` function in Python.

However, since the loop variable `_` does not influence the conditions or states within the loop body, we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time based on the iteration count `t`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is just an iteration counter, the state of `t` should be decremented by 1 after each iteration to reflect the remaining number of iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing one element, `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing `n`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `len(final) != 0`, then `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. `t` is decremented by 1.**
