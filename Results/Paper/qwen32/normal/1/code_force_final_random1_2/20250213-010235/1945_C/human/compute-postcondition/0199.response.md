To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each element in the list `lst`. The loop iterates over each element `elem` in `lst` and checks if the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n / 2`) and `elem` is equal to `mini` (the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`). If this condition is met, `elem` is appended to the `final` list.

Since the loop iterates over every element in `lst`, the final state of `final` will include all elements from `lst` that satisfy the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

Let's summarize the final output state:

- `final` will contain all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
- `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n`.
- `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, which is the length of `lst`.
- `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, and `mini` remain unchanged from their initial states except for `_`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`final` contains all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`; `c1` remains `o * 100 // n`; `_` is incremented by the length of `lst`; `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, and `mini` remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the `final` list will have all elements from `lst` that are closest to `pk` (half of `n`), and other variables will stay as they were initially, with `_` being incremented by the number of elements in `lst`.
