Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing one element, `[0]`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that the `final` list now contains one element, which is `0`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
