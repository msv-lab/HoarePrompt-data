Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is 100000000; `final` is a list containing one element, `[0]`, if `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise, `final` is a list containing `n`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is 100000000, `final` is a list containing `n`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list, `zero` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0', otherwise `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is 100000000, `final` is a list containing `n`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `lst` contains `i + 1` appended to it if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `zero` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0', otherwise `one` is incremented by 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1; if `s[i]` was '0', `zero` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` includes `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
