### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided code and compare it against the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Calculating Thresholds:**
   - The variable `pk` is calculated as `n / 2`, which is used later to find the position closest to the middle of the village.

3. **Counting Preferences:**
   - It counts the total number of '0's (`z`) and '1's (`o`) in the string `s`.

4. **Iterating Through Possible Positions:**
   - It iterates through each possible position `i` where the road could be placed (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - It keeps track of the cumulative count of '0's (`zero`) and '1's (`one`) up to the current position `i`.
   - It calculates the percentage of '0's up to the current position (`zero_perc`) and the percentage of '1's from the current position onward (`one_perc`).

5. **Checking Conditions:**
   - It checks if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%.
   - If both conditions are met, it adds the position `i + 1` to the list `lst`.

6. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - It finds the position in `lst` that is closest to `pk` (the middle of the village).
   - If no such position exists, it determines whether the majority of residents prefer '0' or '1' across the entire string and sets the position to 0 or `n` accordingly.

7. **Output:**
   - It prints the optimal position found.

### Issues Identified:

- **Percentage Calculation:** 
  - The percentages are calculated using integer division (`//`), which is correct, but the values are multiplied by 100 before comparison. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because the percentages are not actually needed; instead, the counts should be directly compared to their respective thresholds (`ceil(i/2)` and `ceil((n-i)/2)`).

- **Threshold Comparison:**
  - The code uses `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should compare the counts directly to their respective thresholds:
    - For the left side (up to position `i`): `zero >= ceil((i + 1) / 2)`
    - For the right side (from position `i+1` onward): `one >= ceil((n - i - 1) / 2)`

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles the edge cases where no valid position is found by checking the overall majority of '0's and '1's, but this logic is flawed due to the incorrect percentage calculation.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect percentage calculations and threshold comparisons, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
