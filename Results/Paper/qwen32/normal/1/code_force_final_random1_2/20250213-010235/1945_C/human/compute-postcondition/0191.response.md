The code snippet appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. None of the other variables are modified by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `final`, which was initially an empty list `[]`, now contains the element `elem`.

Output State: **`final` is `[elem]`, `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n`, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the user input, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`, `lst` contains at least one element, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, and `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
