The given code snippet calculates `one_perc` using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. This calculation updates the value of `one_perc` while other variables remain unchanged unless they are part of the calculation.

Given the initial state, the variables `i`, `zero`, `one`, and `zero_perc` are already defined and their values are based on the conditions provided. The new variable `one_perc` is introduced and calculated based on the existing variables `o`, `one`, `n`, and `i`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; If `s[i]` was '0', `zero` is incremented by 1; Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**.

This means that `one_perc` now holds the value `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and all other variables retain their previously described states.
