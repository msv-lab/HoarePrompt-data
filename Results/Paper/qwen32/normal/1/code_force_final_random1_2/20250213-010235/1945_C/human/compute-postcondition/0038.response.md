Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4
- `n` is at least 2
- `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'
- `s` is the value of the user's input
- `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`
- `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged
- `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged
- `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` (which is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` (which is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50; otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged
- `mini` is 100000000
- The current character `s[i]` is such that `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and 0 otherwise
- `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', and 0 otherwise
- `i` is 4
- `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 5`
- `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`
- If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is '1', `one` is incremented by 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `zero_perc` is recalculated using the formula `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.
- Since `i` is 4, the new formula becomes `zero * 100 // 5`.

Let's assume the value of `zero` before executing the code snippet. There are two possibilities:
1. If `s[4]` is '0', then `zero` is incremented by 1.
2. If `s[4]` is '1', then `one` is incremented by 1, and `zero` remains unchanged.

Since the exact value of `zero` is not specified, we'll consider both cases:

Case 1: If `s[4]` is '0', then `zero` was incremented by 1, making `zero` equal to 1 (assuming `zero` was 0 before this increment).
- New `zero_perc` = `1 * 100 // 5` = 20

Case 2: If `s[4]` is '1', then `zero` remains unchanged.
- New `zero_perc` = `0 * 100 // 5` = 0

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `zero` before the execution of the code snippet, we will consider the general case where `zero` could be either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the value of the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` (which is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` (which is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50; otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged; `mini` is 100000000; the current character `s[i]` is such that `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and 0 otherwise; `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', and 0 otherwise; `i` is 4; `zero_perc` is either 0 or 20; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`**
