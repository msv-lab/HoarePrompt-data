Postcondition: **`mini` is `min(100000000, n / 2)`, `final` is `[elem]` if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` remains `[]`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `zero` is the total count of '0's encountered up to the second last character, `one` is the total count of '1's encountered up to the second last character, `lst` is `[0]`.**
