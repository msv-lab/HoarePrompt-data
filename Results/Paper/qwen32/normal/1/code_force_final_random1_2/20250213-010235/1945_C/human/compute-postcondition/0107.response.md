The given code calculates the percentage of zeros encountered so far in a sequence, based on the current count of zeros (`zero`), ones (`one`), and the index `i`. Here's the updated state after executing the code:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` was '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1. `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `zero_perc` is now the percentage of zeros encountered up to the current index `i`, calculated as `zero` multiplied by 100 and then integer divided by `i + 1`. The values of `i`, `zero`, and `one` remain as per their definitions before the calculation of `zero_perc`.
