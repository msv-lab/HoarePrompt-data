The given code snippet appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. No other variables are modified directly by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; If `s[i]` was '0', `zero` is incremented by 1; Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`; `lst` includes `i + 1`.**
