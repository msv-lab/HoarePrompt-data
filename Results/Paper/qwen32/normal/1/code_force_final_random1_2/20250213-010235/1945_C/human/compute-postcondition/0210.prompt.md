Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pk = n / 2
    else:
        pk = n / 2
    sl = list(s)
    o = sl.count('1')
    z = sl.count('0')
    zero, one = 0, 0
    lst = []
    mini = pow(10, 8)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero += 1
        else:
            one += 1
        zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
        one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
        if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
            lst.append(i + 1)
    for ele in lst:
        mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
    final = []
    for elem in lst:
        if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
            final.append(elem)
    final.sort()
    if len(final) == 0:
        c1 = o * 100 // n
        if c1 >= 50:
            final.append(0)
        else:
            final.append(n)
    print(final[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing one element, `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing `n`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `len(final) != 0`, then `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `final` is either `[0]` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50. `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n`. If `len(final)` was initially 0, the above conditions apply; otherwise, `final` remains `[0, 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `final` is sorted in ascending order. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` becomes a list containing either `[0]` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50. `c1` remains `o * 100 // n`. `_` is incremented by the length of `lst`. `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, and `mini` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
