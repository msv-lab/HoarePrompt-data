The code sorts the list `final`. This means that the order of elements in `final` will be changed to ascending order, but the elements themselves remain the same.

Output State: **`final` is sorted in ascending order; `c1` remains `o * 100 // n`; `_` is incremented by the length of `lst`; `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, and `mini` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language: The list `final` is now sorted in ascending order. The variable `c1` retains its value as `o * 100 // n`. The variable `_` has been incremented by the length of `lst`. All other variables (`n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, and `mini`) remain unchanged.
