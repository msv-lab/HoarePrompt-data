Given the initial state, there seems to be a contradiction because `final` is both described as `[0, 1]` and having a length of `0`. However, since the provided code does not interact with the `final` list, we can proceed with the calculation based on the given code snippet.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
c1 = o * 100 // n
```

This line calculates the value of `c1` based on the variables `o` and `n`. Since `o` and `n` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their specific values. However, we can state that `c1` will be assigned the result of the expression `o * 100 // n`.

Output State: **`final` is [0, 1], but the length of `final` is 0; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**
