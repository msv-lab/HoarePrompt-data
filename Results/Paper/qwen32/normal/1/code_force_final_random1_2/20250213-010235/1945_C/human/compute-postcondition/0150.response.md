The given code snippet initializes two new variables, `zero` and `one`, both set to 0. This does not affect the existing variables `final`, `c1`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, and `z`.

Output State: **`final` is either `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n` before this line) is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50; `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n` (using the old `n` value); `_` is incremented by 1; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the user input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0.**
