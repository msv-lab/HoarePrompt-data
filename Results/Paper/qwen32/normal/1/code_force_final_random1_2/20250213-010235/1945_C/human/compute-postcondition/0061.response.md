Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing for all elements in `lst`, `mini` remains the smallest difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. The list `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that have this smallest difference with `pk`.
