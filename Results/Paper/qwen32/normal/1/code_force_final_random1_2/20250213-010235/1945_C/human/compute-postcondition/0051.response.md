In the given task, the for loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`. The variables `mini` and `final` are mentioned as part of the state before the loop starts, but they are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition. The loop will execute if `lst` contains at least one element.

Let's break down the requirements:

- `mini` is defined as the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. This value is computed based on the contents of `lst`, but it doesn't affect whether the loop will execute.
- `final` is an empty list. This also does not affect the loop's execution condition.

The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which will take on the value of each element in `lst` during each iteration. For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `lst` has at least one element. The values of `mini` and `final` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is an empty list; `lst` must have at least one element**
