Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; if `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing one element, `[0]`, otherwise, `final` is a list containing `n`; if `len(final) != 0`, then `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2`.**

Natural Language: The variable `pk` is now set to half of the value of `n`. All other variables retain their initial states.
