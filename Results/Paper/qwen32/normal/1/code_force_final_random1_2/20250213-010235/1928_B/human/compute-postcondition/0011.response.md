To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop given the initial state and the provided output states after the first few iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of `arr` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
- For each iteration, it multiplies the current value of `tem` by the current element of `arr` and appends the result to `ans`.
- Initially, `tem` is set to 1.

### Iteration Details:
1. **First Iteration** (`i = len(arr) - 1`):
   - `tem` becomes `arr[len(arr) - 1]`
   - `ans` becomes `[arr[len(arr) - 1]]`

2. **Second Iteration** (`i = len(arr) - 2`):
   - `tem` becomes `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`
   - `ans` becomes `[arr[len(arr) - 1], arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]]`

3. **Third Iteration** (`i = len(arr) - 3`):
   - `tem` becomes `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 3]`
   - `ans` becomes `[arr[len(arr) - 1], arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2], arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 3]]`

### General Pattern:
After `k` iterations, `tem` will be the product of the last `k` elements of `arr`, and `ans` will contain these cumulative products in reverse order.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations (when `i` goes from `len(arr) - 1` to `0`), `tem` will be the product of all elements in `arr`, and `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements in reverse order.

### Final Calculation:
- `tem` will be the product of all elements in `arr`.
- `ans` will be a list where each element at index `j` is the product of the last `j+1` elements of `arr` in reverse order.

### Conclusion:
If `arr` has `n` elements, the final `ans` will be a list of length `n` where each element is the cumulative product of the elements from the end of `arr` up to the current position.

### Output State:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `ans` is a list of cumulative products of `arr` in reverse order; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` starting from the last element to the first, and `tem` will be the product of all elements in `arr`.
