The code multiplies the variable `tem` by the element at index `i` of the list `arr`. Given that `tem` is initially 1, the new value of `tem` will be the value of `arr[i]`. The list `arr` and the list `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is an empty list; `tem` is `arr[i]`**.
