The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Since `tem` is defined as `arr[i]`, the value of `ans` will now include this element. The values of `arr` and `tem` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]`; `tem` is `arr[i]`.**
