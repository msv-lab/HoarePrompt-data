Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]`; `tem` is `arr[i] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`; `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `tem` has been updated to be the product of its previous value (`arr[i]`) and the value of `arr[len(arr) - 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
