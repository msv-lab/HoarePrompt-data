The code snippet `n = log2(n)` changes the value of `n` to the base-2 logarithm of its original value. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, `power`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer input by the user, `power` is 1.**
