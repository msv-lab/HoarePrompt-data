To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, let's analyze the condition `power < n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is log2(original value of n).
- `power` is 1.

The loop condition is:
```python
while power < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `power < n` must be true. Initially, `power` is set to 1. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Since `n` is defined as `log2(original value of n)`, we need `log2(original value of n)` to be greater than 1. This implies that the original value of `n` must be greater than 2 (since \( \log_2(2) = 1 \)).

Thus, the original value of `n` must be greater than 2, ensuring that `n` (which is `log2(original value of n)`) is greater than 1.

No other variables in the loop head (`power` and `n`) need further adjustment since we can control the value of `n` by adjusting the original value of `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the original value of `n` must be greater than 2, `n` is log2(original value of n), `power` is 1**
