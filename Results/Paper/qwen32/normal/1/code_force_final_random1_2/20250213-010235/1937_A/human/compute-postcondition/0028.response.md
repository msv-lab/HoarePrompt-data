Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of an integer input by the user where the integer is greater than 2, `power` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `power` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
