To determine the output of the `print(2 ** power)` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0.
3. `i` is set to 1.
4. `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer input by the user.
5. `power` is equal to `n`.

The key variable here is `power`, which is equal to `n`. Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of an integer input by the user, `2 ** power` essentially means raising 2 to the power of the base-2 logarithm of the user's input. 

Mathematically, if `x` is the integer input by the user, then `n = log2(x)`. Therefore, `2 ** n` would be `2 ** log2(x)`, which simplifies to `x`.

So, the `print(2 ** power)` statement will print the original integer input by the user.

Output: **the original integer input by the user**
