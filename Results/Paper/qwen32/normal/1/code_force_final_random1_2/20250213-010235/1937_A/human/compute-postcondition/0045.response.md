The code snippet `n = log2(n)` updates the value of `n` to be the base-2 logarithm of its original value. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, `power`) remain unchanged.

Given that `n` was originally the integer input by the user, after executing the code, `n` will hold the value of `log2(n)`. Since the exact value of `n` (the user input) is not specified, we express the new value of `n` in terms of the logarithmic function.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is log2(n), `power` is 1.**
