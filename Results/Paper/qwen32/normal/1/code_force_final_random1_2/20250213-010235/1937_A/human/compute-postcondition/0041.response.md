The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n_cases`. If `i` is less than `n_cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n_cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `power` are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user (or its base-2 logarithm if it's not 1), `power` is set according to whether it was equal to `n` or not**
