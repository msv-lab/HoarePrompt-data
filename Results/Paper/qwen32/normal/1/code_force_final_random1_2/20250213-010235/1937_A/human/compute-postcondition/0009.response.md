The code increments the value of `power` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the original value of `n` must be greater than 2, `n` is log2(original value of n), `power` is 2**.
