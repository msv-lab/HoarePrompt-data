Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `n` equals 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement directly prints the integer `1`. It does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, or `n`. The value `1` is explicitly provided in the `print` function.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(1)` statement is simply the integer `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
