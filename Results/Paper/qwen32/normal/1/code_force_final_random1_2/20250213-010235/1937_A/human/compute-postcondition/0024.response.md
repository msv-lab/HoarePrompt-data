Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `power` is either equal to the original value of `n` (if the initial condition `power == n` was true) or decreased by 1 (if the initial condition `power == n` was false).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement directly outputs the number `1`, there is no need to reference any of the variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, `n`, `power`) in the output description.

Output: **1**
