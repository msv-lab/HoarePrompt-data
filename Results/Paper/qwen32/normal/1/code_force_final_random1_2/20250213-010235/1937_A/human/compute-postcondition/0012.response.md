To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `power` and `n`.

Given:
- `power` is 3.
- `n` is log2(original value of `n`) and must be greater than 2.

For the loop `while power < n:` to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`. Since `power` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `power` remains 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

Other variables like `t`, `n_cases`, and `i` do not affect the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the original value of `n` must be greater than 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `power` is 3**
