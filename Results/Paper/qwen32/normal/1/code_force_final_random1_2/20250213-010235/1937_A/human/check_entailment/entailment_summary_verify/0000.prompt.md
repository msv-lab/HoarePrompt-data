You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the position of the element `1` in the array after performing the specified sequence of swap operations.

### Analysis of the Program

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using logarithms to determine the position of `1` after the swaps. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Base Case**: If `n == 1`, the array is `[1]`, so the position of `1` is `1`.
2. **General Case**: For `n > 1`, the program calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. This is done using `log2(n)` and then adjusting the result to find the appropriate power of 2.

### Potential Issues

Let's consider a few test cases to verify if the program works correctly:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 4`
   - Initial array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - After `swap(2)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4]`
   - After `swap(3)`: `[3, 1, 2, 4]`
   - After `swap(4)`: `[3, 4, 2, 1]`
   - Position of `1`: `4`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Program Output: `4` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`
   - Initial array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - After `swap(2)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`
   - After `swap(3)`: `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`
   - After `swap(4)`: `[3, 4, 2, 1, 5]`
   - After `swap(5)`: `[3, 4, 2, 1, 5]` (no change since `5` has no divisors other than `1` and `5`)
   - Position of `1`: `4`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Program Output: `4` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 120240229`
   - The program calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `120240229` which is `2^26 = 67108864`.
   - Expected Output: `67108864`
   - Program Output: `67108864` (Correct)

### Conclusion

From the above analysis, the program seems to handle the provided test cases correctly. However, let's consider a more general scenario to ensure there are no edge cases missed.

### Edge Case Consideration

- **Largest Power of 2**: The program correctly identifies the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` and returns `2^power` as the position of `1`. This logic aligns with the problem's behavior where `1` ends up at the position of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

Given the analysis and the fact that the program handles the provided test cases correctly, it appears that the program is indeed correct for all possible inputs within the constraints.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the position of `1` in the array after performing the specified sequence of swap operations by calculating the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. It handles all provided test cases correctly and the logic appears sound for all potential inputs within the given constraints.
