To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses based on the given conditions.

The loop increments `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`, where `n` is \(\log_2(t)\). The loop has executed 1 time when `power` becomes 2, 2 times when `power` becomes 3, and 3 times when `power` becomes 4. This implies that `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to run 3 times.

From the provided output states:
- After 1 iteration, `power` is 2, meaning `n` must be at least 2.
- After 2 iterations, `power` is 3, meaning `n` must be at least 3.
- After 3 iterations, `power` is 4, meaning `n` must be at least 4.

Since the loop continues to increment `power` until it is no longer less than `n`, the loop will stop when `power` equals `n`. Therefore, after all iterations, `power` will equal `n`.

Given that `n` is \(\log_2(t)\), the loop will stop when `power` equals \(\log_2(t)\).

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` remains an integer greater than 0.
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` is \(\log_2(t)\).
- `power` equals `n`, which is \(\log_2(t)\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is \(\log_2(t)\), `power` is \(\log_2(t)\).**
