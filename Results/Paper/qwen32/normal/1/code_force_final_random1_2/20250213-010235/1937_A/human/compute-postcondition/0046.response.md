To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `power < n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `n` is \(\log_2(n)\)
- `power` is 1

The loop condition is `power < n`. For the loop to execute, `power` (which is 1) must be less than `n`.

Let's analyze the value of `n`:
- `n` is defined as \(\log_2(n)\). However, this seems to be a mistake because `n` should be defined in terms of another variable, not itself. Assuming `n` is actually \(\log_2(t)\) or some other variable, let's proceed with the assumption that `n` is \(\log_2(t)\).

For the loop to execute, we need:
\[ 1 < \log_2(t) \]

This inequality holds true when:
\[ t > 2 \]

So, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 2. Since `t` is already given to be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), we just need to make sure it is greater than 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 < t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is \(\log_2(t)\), `power` is 1**
