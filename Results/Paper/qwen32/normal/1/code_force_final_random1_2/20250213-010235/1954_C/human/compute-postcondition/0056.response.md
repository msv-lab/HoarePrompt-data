Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 3, `b` is a non-empty list of integers with at least three elements and `b[1] == a[1]` and `b[2] == a[2]`, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`, `new[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, and `new[2]` is `max(a[2], b[2])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`, `new2[1]` is `a[1]`, and `new2[2]` is `a[2]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
