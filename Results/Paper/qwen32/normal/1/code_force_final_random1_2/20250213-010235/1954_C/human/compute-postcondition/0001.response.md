The code takes an integer input `t`, converts it into a string, then maps each character of the string back into an integer, and finally stores these integers in a list `a`. 

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, the list `a` will contain the individual digits of `t` as integers.

For example, if `t` is 123, `a` will be `[1, 2, 3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `a` is a list containing the individual digits of `t` as integers.**
