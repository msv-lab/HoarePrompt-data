Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(a)`, `b` is a list of integers identical to `a`, `new` is a list of integers where each element `new[j]` is equal to `a[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `i-1`, and `new2` is a list of integers where each element `new2[j]` is equal to `a[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `i-1`. Since the condition `i != len(a)` is always false (as `i` is initialized to `len(a)`), the else part does not execute and the lists `new` and `new2` are identical to `a`.**
