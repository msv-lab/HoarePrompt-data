Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, for each test case, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, x and y have the same length within each test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, list(input())))
    b = list(map(int, list(input())))
    new = [None] * len(a)
    new2 = [None] * len(a)
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    if i != len(a):
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
        while i < len(a):
            new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is either equal to the length of `a` or not. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, then `a` and `b` are lists of elements; `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`; `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the else part does not execute and the state of `a`, `b`, `new`, and `new2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list, `i` is either equal to the length of `a` or not. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, no changes are made to `new` and `new2`. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new[j]` is set to `min(a[j], b[j])` and `new2[j]` is set to `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(a)`, `b` is a list of integers identical to `a`, `new` is a list of integers where each element `new[j]` is equal to `a[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `i-1`, and `new2` is a list of integers where each element `new2[j]` is equal to `a[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `i-1`. Since the condition `i != len(a)` is always false (as `i` is initialized to `len(a)`), the else part does not execute and the lists `new` and `new2` are identical to `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
