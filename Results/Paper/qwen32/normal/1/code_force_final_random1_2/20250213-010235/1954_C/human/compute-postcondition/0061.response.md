The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `a`, `new[i]`, and `new2[i]` remain unchanged because the code only modifies `i`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an integer such that the current value of `i` is not equal to the length of `a` (incremented by 1); `new[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`; `new2[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`.**
