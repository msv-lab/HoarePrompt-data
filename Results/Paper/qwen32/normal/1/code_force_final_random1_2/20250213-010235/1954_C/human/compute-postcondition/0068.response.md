Output State: **`a` is a list with length greater than 1, `i` is 1, `new[0]` is `min(a[0], b[0])`, `new2[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `new2[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`.**

This means that `new2[1]` has been updated to the maximum value between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
