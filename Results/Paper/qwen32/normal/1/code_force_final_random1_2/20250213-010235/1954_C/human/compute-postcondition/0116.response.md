Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is set to the length of the list `a`.
- `b` is a list of integers identical to `a`.
- `new` is a list of integers where each element `new[j]` is equal to `a[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `i-1`.
- `new2` is also a list of integers where each element `new2[j]` is equal to `a[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

Since `i` is set to `len(a)`, both `new` and `new2` will be identical to `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```

### Explanation:
- The code snippet converts each element of the list `new` to a string.
- It then joins these string representations together without any separator.
- Finally, it prints the resulting concatenated string.

Given that `new` is identical to `a`, the output will be a string representation of all the integers in `a` concatenated together.

### Output:
If `a` were `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output would be `'12345'`.

However, since the exact contents of `a` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `a`.

Output: **the concatenated string of all integers in the list `a`**
