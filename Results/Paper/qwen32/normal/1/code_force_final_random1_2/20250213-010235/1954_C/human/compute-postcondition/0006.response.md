To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop's header:

```
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here, the loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `i < len(a)`
2. `a[i] == b[i]`

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **Condition `i < len(a)`**: 
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `a` is a list containing the individual digits of `t` as integers, and since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `a` will have at least 1 digit (and at most 4 digits).
   - Therefore, `len(a)` will be at least 1, and `i < len(a)` will be true because `i` is 0.

2. **Condition `a[i] == b[i]`**:
   - `a` is a list of digits of `t`.
   - `b` is a list of digits of the input.
   - For the loop to execute, the first element of `a` must be equal to the first element of `b`.

Since `i` is 0, we need to ensure that `a[0] == b[0]`. This means the first digit of `t` must match the first digit of the input.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable we can adjust according to the problem constraints is `b` (specifically `b[0]`).
- We need to ensure that `b[0]` is equal to `a[0]`.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a` remains a list containing the individual digits of `t` as integers.
- `b` must be adjusted so that `b[0]` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `new` and `new2` remain lists of length equal to `a` with all elements set to `None`.
- `i` remains 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a list containing the individual digits of `t` as integers, `b` is a list where `b[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, `new` is a list of length equal to `a` with all elements set to `None`, `new2` is a list of length equal to `a` with all elements set to `None`, `i` is 0**
