The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was `len(a) - 1`. After incrementing, `i` becomes `len(a)`. The values of `a`, `b`, `new`, and `new2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(a)`, `b` is a list of integers identical to `a`, `new` is a list of integers where `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[i]` is `a[i]`.**
