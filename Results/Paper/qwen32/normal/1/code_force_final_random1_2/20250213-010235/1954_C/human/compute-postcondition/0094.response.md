Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 2, `b` is a non-empty list of integers with at least three elements where `b[0]` equals `a[0]`, `b[1]` equals `a[1]`, and `b[2]` equals `a[2]`, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`, `new[1]` is `a[1]`, and `new[2]` is `max(a[2], b[2])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]` and `new2[1]` is `a[1]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `new[2]` is updated to be the maximum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
