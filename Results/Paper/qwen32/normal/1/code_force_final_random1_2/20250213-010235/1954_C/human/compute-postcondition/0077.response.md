Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list.
- `i` is either equal to the length of `a` or not.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, no changes are made to `new` and `new2`.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new[j]` is set to `min(a[j], b[j])` and `new2[j]` is set to `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet prints the elements of the list `new` joined into a single string.
- The value of `new` depends on the condition involving `i` and the lists `a` and `b`.

#### Case 1: `i` is not equal to the length of `a`
- No changes are made to `new`.
- The value of `new` remains unchanged from whatever it was initialized to (which is not specified in the initial state).
- Therefore, the output will depend on the initial value of `new`.

#### Case 2: `i` is equal to the length of `a`
- For each index `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`, `new[j]` is set to `min(a[j], b[j])`.
- The `print` statement will then join these values into a single string.

Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `new` or the contents of `a` and `b`, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the output will be based on the initial value of `new`.
2. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the output will be the concatenation of the minimum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.

Given the lack of specific initial values, we'll describe the output in terms of the conditions provided.

### Final Output Description:
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the output will be the string representation of the initial value of `new`.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the output will be the concatenated string of `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and the initial `new` are not provided, we cannot give a specific numerical output. However, based on the conditions, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **the string representation of `new` (where `new` is either its initial value if `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, or a list of `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1` if `i` is equal to the length of `a`)**
