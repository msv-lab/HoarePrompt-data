Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `a` is a list.
- `i` is either equal to the length of `a` or not.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, no changes are made to `new` and `new2`.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new[j]` is set to `min(a[j], b[j])` and `new2[j]` is set to `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**: The key condition here is whether `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
   - If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new2` remains unchanged from its initial state (which is not specified in the initial state, so we assume it could be any list).
   - If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new2[j]` is set to `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Output Determination**:
   - Since the initial state does not specify the initial values of `new` and `new2`, and it does not provide the contents of list `b`, we cannot determine the exact values of `new2` unless `i` equals the length of `a`.
   - If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the content of `new2` remains unknown.
   - If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new2` will contain the maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.

Given the lack of specific values for `a`, `b`, `new2`, and the condition `i == len(a)`, we can only describe the output in terms of the described conditions.

### Conclusion:
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the output will be a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `new2`, where each element in `new2` is the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the output will depend on the initial state of `new2`, which is not provided.

Since we do not have enough information to determine the exact values, we describe the output based on the condition:

Output: **''.join(str(x) for x in new2) (where new2[j] = max(a[j], b[j]) for all j from 0 to len(a) - 1 if i == len(a))**
