Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`, `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. For each index `j` in the list `a`, `new[j]` will hold the minimum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`, and `new2[j]` will hold the maximum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`.
