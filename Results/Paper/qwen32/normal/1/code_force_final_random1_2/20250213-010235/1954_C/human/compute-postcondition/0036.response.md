Postcondition: **`i` is equal to the length of `a`; `a` and `b` are lists of elements; `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`; `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`. Note that the else part does not execute since there is no else block.**

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the provided "if part" postcondition because it states `i` is equal to the length of `a` which contradicts the if condition `i != len(a)`. Assuming the intention was to describe the state when `i == len(a)`, here is the corrected version:

Postcondition: **`i` is either equal to the length of `a` or not. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, then `a` and `b` are lists of elements; `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`; `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the else part does not execute and the state of `a`, `b`, `new`, and `new2` remains unchanged.**
