Output State: **`i` is 1; `a` must have a length greater than 1; `b` is a list of elements; `new[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`; `new2[0]` is `min(a[0], b[0])`; `new[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`; `new2[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`; `new[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`**

Explanation: The value of `new[1]` is updated to be the minimum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
