The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. The loop runs for a number of times specified by the user input, and the loop body itself is omitted, meaning it doesn't directly influence the variables `a`, `i`, `new`, `new2`, or `b`.

Given the description, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect that the loop control variable (the underscore `_`) is simply incremented by 1, but since it's a throwaway variable, there's no specific state change to report for it.

However, we need to consider the state of `i` and how it relates to the length of `a`. Since the loop head does not involve `i`, `a`, `new`, `new2`, or `b`, these variables remain unchanged from the end of the previous iteration to the start of the next iteration unless modified within the loop body, which they are not in this case.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration with respect to the variables mentioned.

State: **`a` is a list, `i` is either equal to the length of `a` or not. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, no changes are made to `new` and `new2`. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new[j]` is set to `min(a[j], b[j])` and `new2[j]` is set to `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.**
