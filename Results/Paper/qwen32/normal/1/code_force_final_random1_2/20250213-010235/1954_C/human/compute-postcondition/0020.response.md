The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Given that `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the list `a` and the element `i` remain unchanged. The list `b` also remains unchanged. The only change is the assignment to `new[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is not equal to the length of `a`; `a` is a list of elements; `b` is a list of elements; `new[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`.**
