Output State: **`i` is not equal to the length of `a` + 1; `a` is a list of elements; `b` is a list of elements; `new[i-1]` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`; `new2[i-1]` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `new[i-1]`, and `new2[i-1]`) remain unchanged except for the index used in `new` and `new2` which now refers to the previous value of `i`.
