#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` for i from 3 to n are computed using the formula dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is n + 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` computes and returns a value based on the input integer `n` using a dynamic programming approach. It calculates a sequence where each term is derived from the previous terms according to a specific formula, and the result is taken modulo 1,000,000,007. The function does not use or modify any other input parameters mentioned in the annotations such as `t`, `k`, `r_i`, or `c_i`.
