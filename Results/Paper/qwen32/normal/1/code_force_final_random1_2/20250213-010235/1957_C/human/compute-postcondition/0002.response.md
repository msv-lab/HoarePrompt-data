In the given task, the for loop starts with `i` ranging from 3 to `n + 1`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i` and `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = n + 1`. This means for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 3 (since `i` starts at 3).

2. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `i`: Since the loop starts with `i = 3`, we don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts because the loop initialization sets `i` to 3.
   - `n`: `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted according to the problem constraints.

Given these points, the state before the loop should be adjusted such that `n` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
