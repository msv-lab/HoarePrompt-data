To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop evolves and compute the values of `dp[i]` up to `dp[n]`.

Given:
- Initial State: `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`
- Loop: `for i in range(3, n + 1): dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`

We know from the problem statement that:
- After 1 iteration (`i=3`), `dp[3] = 7`.
- After 2 iterations (`i=4`), `dp[4] = 25`.

Let's continue this process to find `dp[n]`.

### Calculation of `dp[i]` for `i` from 5 to `n`

Using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`, we can compute the subsequent values:

- For `i=5`: 
  \[
  dp[5] = (dp[4] + 2 * 4 * dp[3]) \% 1000000007 = (25 + 2 * 4 * 7) \% 1000000007 = (25 + 56) \% 1000000007 = 81
  \]

- For `i=6`: 
  \[
  dp[6] = (dp[5] + 2 * 5 * dp[4]) \% 1000000007 = (81 + 2 * 5 * 25) \% 1000000007 = (81 + 250) \% 1000000007 = 331
  \]

Continuing this process iteratively until `i=n`, we can compute `dp[n]`. However, since the problem doesn't specify a particular value for `n`, the final output state will be described in terms of `dp[n]` being computed through the loop.

### Final Output State

After all iterations, the state will be:
- `t` remains as it was initially.
- `n` remains as it was initially.
- `k` remains as it was initially.
- The list of moves `r_i` and `c_i` remains unchanged.
- `dp[1]` is 1.
- `dp[2]` is 3.
- `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `n` are computed using the loop formula.
- The loop variable `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop finishes.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` for i from 3 to n are computed using the formula dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is n + 1.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the `dp` array will be fully computed up to `dp[n]` using the given formula, and the loop index `i` will be `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
