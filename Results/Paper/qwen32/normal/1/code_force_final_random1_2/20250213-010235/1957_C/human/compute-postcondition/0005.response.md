The given code snippet calculates the next value in the `dp` array using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. 

Given the initial state, `dp[1]` is 1, and `dp[2]` is 3. The code calculates `dp[i]` based on the previous two values.

Since the code only updates `dp[i]` and does not affect other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`), we only need to update `dp[i]`.

Let's assume `i` is the current index for which we are calculating `dp[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` would start from 3 (since `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are already defined).

Thus, the new value of `dp[i]` will be calculated as per the formula.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is `i + 1`**.
