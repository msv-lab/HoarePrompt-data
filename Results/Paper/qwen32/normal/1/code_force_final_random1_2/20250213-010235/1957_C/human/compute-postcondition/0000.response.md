The given code snippet initializes an array (or list) `dp` with the first element set to 1. However, the initial state description does not specify the existence or size of the `dp` array/list before this operation. Based on the provided code, we can infer that `dp` is being initialized or its first element is being set to 1.

Given the initial state, no other variables are affected except for the `dp` array/list which now has its first element set to 1.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `dp[1]` is 1.**
