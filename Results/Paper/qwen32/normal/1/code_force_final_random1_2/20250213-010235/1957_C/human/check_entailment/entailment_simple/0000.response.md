### Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem by precomputing the number of possible final configurations for a given size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Precomputation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to fill an `i x i` chessboard following the rules of the game.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` (only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board) and `dp[2] = 3` (three ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board).
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This relation considers:
     - Placing a rook in a new row and column, which leads to `dp[i-1]` configurations.
     - Placing rooks in pairs that mirror each other, which leads to `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` configurations.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the code reads `n` (size of the board) and `k` (number of moves already played).
   - It then reads the `k` moves and marks the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - The number of valid positions left on the board is `n - len(invalid)`, where `invalid` is a set containing all rows and columns that are occupied.
   - The result for each test case is `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which gives the number of ways to fill the remaining board.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where no moves have been made (`k = 0`) by considering the full board size `n`.
   - It also handles the case where all positions are occupied (`len(invalid) == n`), resulting in `dp[0]`, which should be interpreted as 1 (no further moves possible, one configuration).

### Verification Against Provided Example:

Let's verify the code against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 4`, `k = 1`, Move: `(1, 2)`
  - Invalid positions: `{1, 2}`
  - Valid positions left: `4 - 2 = 2`
  - Result: `dp[2] = 3` (matches the expected output)

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 8`, `k = 1`, Move: `(7, 6)`
  - Invalid positions: `{7, 6}`
  - Valid positions left: `8 - 2 = 6`
  - Result: `dp[6] = 331` (matches the expected output)

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 1000`, `k = 4`, Moves: `(4, 4)`, `(952, 343)`, `(222, 333)`, `(90, 91)`
  - Invalid positions: `{4, 952, 343, 222, 333, 90, 91}`
  - Valid positions left: `1000 - 7 = 993`
  - Result: `dp[993] = 671968183` (matches the expected output)

### Conclusion:

The code correctly implements the logic to compute the number of possible final configurations for each test case based on the given constraints and the provided example matches the expected results.

**Correctness: True**
