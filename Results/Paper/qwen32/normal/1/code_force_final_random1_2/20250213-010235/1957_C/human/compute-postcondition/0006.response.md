The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop iterates from 3 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4,
- `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3,
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n,
- Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n,
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5,
- `dp[1]` is 1,
- `dp[2]` is 3,
- `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007,
- `i` is `i + 1`.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value. Therefore, if `i` was at some value `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is `i + 1`** 

Since `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we need to reflect that increment here:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, to be precise about the state transition:
If `i` was 3 at the start of the previous iteration and was incremented to 4 at the end, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

So, if we generalize, and assuming `i` was `x` at the start of the previous iteration and `x+1` at the end, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x+1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is 4** (assuming `i` was 3 at the start of the previous iteration)

Generalizing:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is `i + 1`**

But specifically for the next iteration starting point:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is 4**
