The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies a list `a` by potentially replacing elements within a specified range `[l, r]` with a uniform value if a certain condition is met. It also records operations performed in a list `ops`. The final state of the program results in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` being transformed such that all its elements are equal to `r - l + 1` if the sum of the sublist is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. Otherwise, it recursively processes sublists around the maximum element in the current sublist.
