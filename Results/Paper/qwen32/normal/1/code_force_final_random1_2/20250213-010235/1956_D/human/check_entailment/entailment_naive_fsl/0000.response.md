Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Undefined Variable `a` in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` references the variable `a`, but `a` is not defined within the scope of this function. It seems like `a` should be passed as a parameter to `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Undefined Variable `ops` in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: Similarly, the variable `ops` is used in `recursive_maximize_sum` but is not defined within its scope. It should also be passed as a parameter.

3. **Incorrect Function Calls**: The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing the necessary arguments (`a` and `ops`). This will result in errors.

4. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to ensure that the subarray from index `l` to `r` is filled with the MEX value of the subarray. However, the current implementation incorrectly sets the values to `r - l + 1` instead of computing the MEX value.

5. **Incorrect Logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` contains logic that is not aligned with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a valid way to determine whether to replace the subarray with its MEX value.

6. **Incorrect Output Format**: The function `func_3` prints the operations with indices incremented by 1, which is correct according to the problem statement. However, since the underlying logic is flawed, the output will not necessarily be correct.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be rewritten to correctly compute the MEX value for each subarray and apply the operations accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def mex(subarray):
    mex_value = 0
    while mex_value in subarray:
        mex_value += 1
    return mex_value

def maximize_sum(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    
    def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
        if l > r:
            return
        subarray = a[l:r+1]
        current_mex = mex(subarray)
        if current_mex != max(subarray):
            ops.append((l, r))
            for i in range(l, r + 1):
                a[i] = current_mex
        else:
            mx = max(subarray)
            pos = a.index(mx, l, r + 1)
            if pos != l:
                recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
            if pos != r:
                recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
    
    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return sum(a), len(ops), ops

def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = maximize_sum(a)
    print(s, m)
    for l, r in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function
# main()
```

This corrected version defines the MEX function, ensures that `a` and `ops` are properly passed to the recursive function, and correctly applies the operations to maximize the sum of the array.
