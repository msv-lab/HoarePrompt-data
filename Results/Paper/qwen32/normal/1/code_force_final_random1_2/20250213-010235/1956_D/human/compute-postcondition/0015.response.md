The given code snippet calls a function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)`. This function call does not directly modify the variables `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` in the provided initial state. Instead, it likely performs some operations within its own scope that do not affect these variables directly unless there are side effects not shown in the snippet.

Since the function call does not alter the listed variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, and `pos`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`; `s` is the sum of elements `a[l]` to `a[r]` and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`; `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. Additionally, `pos` is not equal to `l`.**
