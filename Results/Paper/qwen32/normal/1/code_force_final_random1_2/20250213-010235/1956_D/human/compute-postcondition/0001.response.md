The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the original list `a` is replaced with a new list derived from the input.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is the integer value provided by the input.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `a` now holds a list of integers that were provided in the input, separated by spaces. The variable `n` retains its original value as it was not modified by the code snippet.
