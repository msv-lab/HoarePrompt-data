### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to ensure it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to modify the array `a` within the range `[l, r]` based on the MEX operation.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not zero and sets `a[l]` to zero if true, appending the operation `(l, l)` to `ops`.
   - If `l != r`, it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`, and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If true, it appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops`, sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1`, and recursively calls itself again with `l + 1` and `r`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes `ops` as an empty list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
   - It returns the sum of the modified array `a`, the length of `ops`, and `ops` itself.
   - However, there is a critical issue here: `ops` is not defined in the scope of `func_2`. It seems like `ops` is supposed to be passed to `recursive_maximize_sum` but is not.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function calculates the sum `s` of the elements in the range `[l, r]`.
   - If `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`, appends `(l, r)` to `ops`, and sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value `mx` in the range `[l, r]` and its position `pos`. It then recursively calls itself on the ranges `[l, pos - 1]` and `[pos + 1, r]` if `pos` is not equal to `l` or `r`, respectively.
   - Similar to `func_2`, `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input values, calls `func_2` with the input array `a`, and prints the sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints each operation stored in `ops`.

### Issues Identified:
- **Scope of `ops`**: The variable `ops` is not properly passed or defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum` and `func_2`. This would lead to errors during execution.
- **Logic of `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` seems to be intended to set the range `[l, r]` to the MEX value, but the implementation details are not fully aligned with the problem statement's requirement to maximize the sum using the MEX operation.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly the improper handling of the `ops` variable and the potential misinterpretation of the MEX operation logic, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
