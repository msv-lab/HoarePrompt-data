In the given task, the for loop iterates over the elements of the `ops` list, where each element is expected to be a tuple `(l, r)`. For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple.

Let's break down the objects in the loop head:
- `l` and `r` are variables that will take the values from each tuple in `ops`.

Given this, we need to ensure that `ops` contains at least one tuple for the loop to execute. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `s`, `m`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `ops` contains at least one tuple.

State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, `s` is the first return value of `func_2`, `m` is the second return value of `func_2`, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple (l, r)**
