The given code snippet calls a function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)`. This function call does not directly modify any of the variables `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` in the provided initial state. Instead, it likely performs some operations within its own scope, which are not detailed here.

Since there is no direct change to the variables mentioned in the initial state due to the function call, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been invoked with the arguments `pos + 1` and `r`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`. `s` is the sum of elements `a[l]` to `a[r]` and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. Additionally, `pos` is not equal to `l` and `pos` is not equal to `r`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.**
