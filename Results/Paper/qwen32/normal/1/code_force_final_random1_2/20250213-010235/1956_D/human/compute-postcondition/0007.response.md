To determine the output of the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **`a`**: This is a list of integers derived from the input.
2. **`n`**: This is an integer value provided by the input.
3. **`s` and `m`**: These are the first and second return values of a function `func_2`, respectively. However, the details of `func_2` and the exact values of `s` and `m` are not provided.
4. **`ops`**: This is a list containing at least two tuples. Each tuple likely represents some operation to be performed on the list `a`.
5. **`(l, r)`**: This is the next tuple to be processed from the list `ops`. The values of `l` and `r` are not explicitly given but are part of the tuple that is currently being processed.

Given this information, we know that the `print` statement will output the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`. Since the specific values of `l` and `r` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of their roles within the context of the `ops` list.

### Explanation:
- `l` and `r` are the elements of the current tuple being processed from the `ops` list.
- The `print` statement adds 1 to both `l` and `r` before printing them.

### Output:
Since `l` and `r` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l and r are the elements of the current tuple being processed from the ops list)**
