Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`. If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then `i` is `r + 1`, `a[i]` for `i` in the range `[l, r]` is `r - l + 1`, `s` is `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, and `ops` includes the tuple `(l, r)`. Otherwise, `s` is the sum of elements `a[l]` to `a[r]` and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and `pos` is not equal to `l`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.**
