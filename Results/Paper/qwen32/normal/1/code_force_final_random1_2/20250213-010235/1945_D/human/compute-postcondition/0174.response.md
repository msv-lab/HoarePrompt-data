Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is updated to its previous value plus `a_values[max_p]` if `a_values[max_p]` is less than `b_values[max_p]`; otherwise, `custo` is updated to its previous value plus `b_values[max_p]`.**
