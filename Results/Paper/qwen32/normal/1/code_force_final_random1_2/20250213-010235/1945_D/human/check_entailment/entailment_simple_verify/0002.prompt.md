You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
- Kirill is at the end of a queue of `n` people.
- He wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
- To move, he can swap with someone in front of him, paying `a_j` coins to swap directly with person `j`, and `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and his current position.
- We need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the queue from the end to the `m`-th position, calculating the cost based on the conditions provided. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation Logic**:
   - The program checks if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]` to decide whether to add `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` to the cost. This logic is flawed because it doesn't consider the cumulative cost of moving past multiple people.
   - The second loop also has incorrect logic. It tries to add costs conditionally but does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple swaps are needed.

2. **Handling Multiple Swaps**:
   - The problem requires considering the cost of swapping with multiple people and the cost of moving past them. The provided program does not account for this correctly.
   - For example, if Kirill needs to move past several people, he must consider the cumulative cost of these swaps, which involves both `a` and `b` values.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `m = 1` or when the cost of direct swaps (`a`) is always lower than the cost of moving past people (`b`).

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a more systematic approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, to calculate the minimum cost of moving Kirill to one of the first `m` positions. Here is a high-level outline of a correct approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Use a DP table `dp[i]` to store the minimum cost to move to position `i`.
   - Initialize `dp[n]` to 0 (since Kirill starts at position `n`).
   - Iterate backward from `n-1` to `0`, updating the DP table based on the costs of swapping and moving past people.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each position `i`, calculate the cost of moving to position `j` (where `j < i`) using the formula:
     \[
     dp[j] = \min(dp[j], dp[i] + a_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k)
     \]

3. **Result Extraction**:
   - The result for each test case is the minimum value in `dp[0]` to `dp[m-1]`.

Given the issues with the provided program, it is clear that it does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
