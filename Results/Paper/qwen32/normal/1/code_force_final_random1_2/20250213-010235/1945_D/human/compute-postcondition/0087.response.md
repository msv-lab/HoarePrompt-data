The given code snippet increments the `total` variable by the value at index `v` in the `custo_pra_passar_b` list. No other variables are modified directly by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `c` is `c + 1`
- `cases` is greater than `c + 1`
- `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 (and is at least 0)
- `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input
- `v` is `na_frente - 2`
- If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`

After executing the line `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, the value of `total` changes, but no other variables are affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`c` is `c + 1`, `cases` is greater than `c + 1`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 (and is at least 0), `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`**.
