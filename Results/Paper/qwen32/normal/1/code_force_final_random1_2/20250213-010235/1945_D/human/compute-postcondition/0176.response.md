The value of `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]`. Given that `y` is `y_end - 1`, the specific value added to `custo` depends on the value of `a_values[y_end - 1]`. The values of `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `y_end` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `y` is `y_end - 1`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y_end - 1]`.**
