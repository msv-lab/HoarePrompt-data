The code snippet `nf = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `nf`. 

Given the initial state, the variables `i`, `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `a`, `b`, and `custo` remain unchanged. Only `nf` is updated.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is 0, `max_p` is 0, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, and `custo` is 0.**
