Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y` and the newly appended integer value of `y`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input and must contain at least one element, `custo` is 0, `y` is the next element in `b`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `b_values` now includes an additional element, which is the integer value of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
