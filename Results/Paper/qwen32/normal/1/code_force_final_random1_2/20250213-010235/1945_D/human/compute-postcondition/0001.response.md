To determine the necessary adjustments for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `c` and `cases`.

Here's the analysis:

- The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than or equal to 1 because `range(cases)` will generate values from 0 up to `cases - 1`.
- The variable `c` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts; it will be automatically initialized to 0 when the loop begins.

Given this, the only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is `cases`. It must be at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1**
