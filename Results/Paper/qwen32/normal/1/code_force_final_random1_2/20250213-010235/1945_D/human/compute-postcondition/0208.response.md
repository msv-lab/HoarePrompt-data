Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, `custo` is the accumulated sum of `b_values[3]`, `b_values[2]`, `b_values[1]`, and `a_values[0]`, `custos` is a list that now includes the value of `custo`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `custo` has been added to the list `custos`. All other variables remain unchanged.
