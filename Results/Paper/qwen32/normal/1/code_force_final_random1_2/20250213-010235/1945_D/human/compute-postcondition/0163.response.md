The code appends the integer value of `y` to the list `b_values`. Since `y` is already mentioned to be the next element in `b`, and `b_values` initially contains the integer value of `y` and another newly appended integer value of `y`, after executing the code, `b_values` will have three elements: the first two being the integer value of `y` and the third also being the integer value of `y`.

Therefore, the updated state of `b_values` will be a list with three identical integer values, each equal to the integer value of `y`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing three integer values, each equal to the integer value of `y`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input and must contain at least two elements, `custo` is 0, `y` is the next element in `b`**.
