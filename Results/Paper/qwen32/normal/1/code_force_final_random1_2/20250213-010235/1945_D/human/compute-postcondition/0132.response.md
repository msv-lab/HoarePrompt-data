Postcondition: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**
