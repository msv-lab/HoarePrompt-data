The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns them to the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The values of `c`, `cases`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is `c + 1`, `cases` must be greater than `c + 1`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input.**
