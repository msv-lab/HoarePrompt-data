Output State: **`c` is `c + 1`, `cases` is greater than `c + 1`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 (and is at least 0), `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. All other variables retain their previous values unless `best` was greater than the new `total`, in which case `best` is updated to the new `total`.
