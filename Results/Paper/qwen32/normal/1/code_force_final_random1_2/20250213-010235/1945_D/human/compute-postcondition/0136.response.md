Output State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `total` is increased by the value at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
