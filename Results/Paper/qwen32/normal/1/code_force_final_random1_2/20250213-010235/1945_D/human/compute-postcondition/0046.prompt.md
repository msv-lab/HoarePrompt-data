Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `pos_final` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `total` is 0; `best` is 10
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` is an integer read from the input minus 1 (ensuring `na_frente` is at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `v` is compared to `pos_final`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` was initially greater than the new `total`, then `best` is updated to the new `total`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is set to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` is an integer read from the input minus 1 (ensuring `na_frente` is at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `v` is `na_frente - 1`. If `v <= pos_final`, then `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Additionally, if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]` if it is greater than the current `best`. If `v > pos_final`, then `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` is an integer read from the input minus 1 (ensuring `na_frente` is at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `v` is `v - 1`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; otherwise, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Additionally, if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is greater than the current `best`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; otherwise, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
