To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the `custo` variable based on the conditions provided.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`.
- In each iteration, it compares `a_values[y]` with `b_values[y]`.
- If `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo`.
- Otherwise, it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo`.

### Iteration Details:
- **First Iteration (y = num_fila - 1)**: Adds either `a_values[num_fila - 1]` or `b_values[num_fila - 1]` to `custo`.
- **Second Iteration (y = num_fila - 2)**: Adds either `a_values[num_fila - 2]` or `b_values[num_fila - 2]` to `custo`.
- **Third Iteration (y = num_fila - 3)**: Adds either `a_values[num_fila - 3]` or `b_values[num_fila - 3]` to `custo`.

### Final Iteration:
The loop continues until `y` reaches `max_p`. Therefore, the final iteration will be when `y = max_p`.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations, `custo` will have accumulated the sum of the smaller values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`.

### Output State:
- `i` is incremented by 1 (as per the initial state description).
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `num_fila` and `max_p` remain as they were initially.
- `a_values` and `b_values` remain as they were initially.
- `nf`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were initially.
- `custo` is the accumulated sum of the smaller values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is the accumulated sum of the smaller values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`.**
