You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: The loop has executed `cases` number of times. For each iteration, `c` ranges from 0 to `cases-1`. For each case, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are adjusted by subtracting 1 from their respective input values. `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers read from the input. The variable `total` accumulates the sum of the smallest costs encountered during the inner loop, and `best` keeps track of the minimum cost found when `v <= pos_final`. After processing all cases, the final output consists of the minimum costs for each case printed sequentially.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (with `m` ≤ `n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost required to reach a specified position `m` from position `n` by either passing through elements in list `b` or swapping to elements in list `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python code to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Kirill starts at the end of a queue of `n` people.
   - He wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
   - To move forward, Kirill can bribe someone in front of him.
     - Bribing the `i-th` person costs `a_i` coins.
     - Additionally, for every person between the bribed person and Kirill, he has to pay `b_k` coins.
   - We need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The code iterates from the last person in the queue to the first.
   - It maintains a running total of the cost (`total`) and keeps track of the best (minimum) cost found so far (`best`).
   - For each person, it checks if Kirill can reach the desired position (`v <= pos_final`).
     - If yes, it updates the `best` cost considering the cost to bribe that person.
     - It then adds either `a[v]` or `b[v]` to the `total` cost, depending on which is smaller.
   - If Kirill cannot reach the desired position, it still adds either `a[v]` or `b[v]` to the `total` cost, but does not update the `best` cost.

3. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic for updating the `total` cost is flawed. Specifically, adding `b[v]` to the `total` cost when Kirill cannot reach the desired position is incorrect. This is because `b[v]` represents the cost to pass through person `v`, which is irrelevant if Kirill is not moving past them.
   - The condition `if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:` is used to decide whether to add `a[v]` or `b[v]` to the `total`. However, this logic does not correctly account for the fact that `b[v]` should only be added when Kirill is moving past person `v`.
   - The initial value of `best` is set to a very large number (`10 ** 12`), which is fine, but the logic for updating `best` does not correctly handle all scenarios.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A more appropriate approach would involve using a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position.
   - Alternatively, a dynamic programming approach could be used to calculate the minimum cost to reach each position.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the code's logic, it is clear that the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
