Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is 0, `max_p` is 0, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `custo` is 0.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that `b_values` is reassigned to an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.
