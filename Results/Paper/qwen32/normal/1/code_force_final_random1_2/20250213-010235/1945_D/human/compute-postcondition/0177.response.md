The code snippet adds the value of `b_values[y]` to the variable `custo`. Given that `y` is `y_end - 1`, the value added to `custo` is specifically `b_values[y_end - 1]`.

The values of `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `y_end` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `custo`, which now includes the addition of `b_values[y_end - 1]`.

Output State: **`num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `y` is `y_end - 1`, `custo` is updated to include `b_values[y_end - 1]`.**
