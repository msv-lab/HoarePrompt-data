Postcondition: **`c` is `c + 1`, `cases` is greater than `c + 1`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 (and is at least 0), `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input, `best` is 10, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
