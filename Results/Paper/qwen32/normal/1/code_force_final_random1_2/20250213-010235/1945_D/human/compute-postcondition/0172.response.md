The code snippet `custo += a_values[y]` increments the variable `custo` by the value of `a_values[y]`. Given that `y` is `max_p`, the value added to `custo` is specifically `a_values[max_p]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `custo` will be its previous value plus `a_values[max_p]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is updated to its previous value plus `a_values[max_p]`.**
