Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the code step-by-step to see if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

1. **Class Definition**: The `BalanceInfo` class is correctly defined to store the balance, position, and character of each prefix in the parentheses sequence.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects (`infoA` and `infoB`). According to the problem statement, the sorting should be done based on the balance in ascending order and position in descending order when balances are equal. However, the function does not return the correct value for sorting purposes. It should return a negative number if `infoA` should come before `infoB`, zero if they are equivalent in terms of sorting, and a positive number if `infoA` should come after `infoB`. Instead, it returns the difference between `infoA.balance` and `infoB.balance` directly, which is not suitable for sorting with the additional requirement of descending order of position when balances are equal. The correct implementation would involve returning a tuple `(infoA.balance, -infoA.position)` for comparison, but since this function is not used in the provided `func_2`, it doesn't affect the correctness of the overall program.

3. **Function `func_2`**: 
   - It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through the string `s` to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each storing the balance, position, and character at that position.
   - After constructing the list, it sorts it using a lambda function as the key. The lambda function sorts primarily by `balance` in ascending order and secondarily by `-position` in descending order, which aligns with the problem statement.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints it.

Given the analysis, the `func_2` function correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Although `func_1` is defined, it is not used in the provided code, so it does not impact the correctness of the solution.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
