### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

1. **Class Definition (`BalanceInfo`)**:
   - This class is used to store information about each character in the parentheses sequence, including its balance, position, and the character itself.
   
2. **Sorting Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is intended to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects (`infoA` and `infoB`). It sorts primarily by `balance` in ascending order and secondarily by `position` in descending order when balances are equal.
   - However, the output hint provided for `func_1` is misleading. The function should return `infoB.position - infoA.position` instead of `0` when `infoA.balance == infoB.balance` to ensure descending order by position.

3. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - This function processes the input string `s` to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It calculates the balance for each prefix of the string and stores it along with the position and character.
   - The list of `BalanceInfo` objects is then sorted using a lambda function that should call `func_1` but directly uses the criteria specified in the problem statement.
   - Finally, it constructs the resulting shuffled sequence by joining the characters from the sorted list and prints it.

### Issues Identified:
- The sorting criteria in `func_2` are correct, but the output hint for `func_1` suggests it does not implement the secondary sorting criterion (descending order by position) properly.
- Despite the misleading output hint for `func_1`, the lambda function in `func_2` correctly sorts the list as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
- The program, despite the misleading output hint for `func_1`, correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement through the sorting logic in `func_2`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
