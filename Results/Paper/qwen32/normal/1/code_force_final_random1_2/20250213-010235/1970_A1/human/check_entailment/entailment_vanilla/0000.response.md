To determine if the given Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement, let's break down the code step-by-step and compare it with the requirements.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Class Definition (`BalanceInfo`)**:
   - The code snippet does not include the definition of the `BalanceInfo` class, which is used to store the balance, position, and character information for each position in the string.
   - We need to assume that `BalanceInfo` is defined elsewhere in the code and has attributes `balance`, `position`, and `character`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is supposed to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It first compares the `balance` attribute. If they are different, it returns the difference.
   - If the `balance` attributes are the same, it compares the `position` attribute in reverse order (i.e., higher positions come first).
   - This comparison logic aligns with the sorting criteria mentioned in the problem statement.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function takes a string `s` as input and calculates the balance information for each character.
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It iterates through the string, updating the balance and appending a new `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` for each character.
   - After collecting all balance information, it sorts the `balance_info` list using the `func_1` comparison logic.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the `character` attributes of the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints it.

### Verification Against Requirements:

- **Balance Calculation**: The balance is calculated correctly by incrementing when encountering '(', and decrementing when encountering ')'.
- **Sorting Criteria**: The sorting criteria match the problem statement: first by balance in ascending order, then by position in descending order.
- **Result Construction**: The result is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:

Given that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the provided example matches the expected output, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
