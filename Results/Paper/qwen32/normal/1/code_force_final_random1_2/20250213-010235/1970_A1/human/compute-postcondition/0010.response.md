The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given:
- `s` is a string of balanced parentheses.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `balance_info` contains a `BalanceInfo` object with `balance` and `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` was the index of the last processed character in `s`.
- `n` remains the same as it is the length of the string `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop iterates over each character in the string `s` from index 0 to `n-1`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing one `BalanceInfo` object; `i` is incremented by 1.** 

To be more precise:
State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing one `BalanceInfo` object; `i` is now `i + 1`.**
