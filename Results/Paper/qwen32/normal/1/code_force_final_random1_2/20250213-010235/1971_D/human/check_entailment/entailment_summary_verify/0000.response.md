Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic to ensure it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- Given a binary string, we need to cut it into the minimum number of pieces such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).
- Each piece must be a contiguous substring of the original string.
- All pieces must be used in the rearrangement.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The code initializes `count` to 1 because at least one piece is always needed.
2. **Transition Counting**: It iterates through the string `s` and increments `count` whenever it encounters a transition from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'.
3. **Flag Setting**: It sets a `flag` to `True` if it finds a transition from '0' to '1'.
4. **Adjustment**: After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the `count`.

### Testing the Code:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Examples:
1. **Input:** `11010`
   - Transitions: `1->0`, `0->1`, `1->0`
   - Count: 4
   - Flag: True (since there is a `0->1` transition)
   - Final Count: 3
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - Transitions: None
   - Count: 1
   - Flag: False
   - Final Count: 1
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1`
   - Transitions: None
   - Count: 1
   - Flag: False
   - Final Count: 1
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `10`
   - Transitions: `1->0`
   - Count: 2
   - Flag: True (since there is a `1->0` transition)
   - Final Count: 1
   - Output: `2` (Incorrect, should be `2`)

5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - Transitions: `0->1`
   - Count: 2
   - Flag: True (since there is a `0->1` transition)
   - Final Count: 1
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

6. **Input:** `0110`
   - Transitions: `0->1`, `1->0`
   - Count: 3
   - Flag: True (since there is a `0->1` transition)
   - Final Count: 2
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **Input:** `01010101`
   - Transitions: `0->1`, `1->0`, `0->1`, `1->0`
   - Count: 5
   - Flag: True (since there is a `0->1` transition)
   - Final Count: 4
   - Output: `4` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `10101010`
   - Transitions: `1->0`, `0->1`, `1->0`, `0->1`
   - Count: 5
   - Flag: True (since there is a `0->1` transition)
   - Final Count: 4
   - Output: `4` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `111000`
   - Transitions: `1->0`
   - Count: 2
   - Flag: True (since there is a `1->0` transition)
   - Final Count: 1
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Analysis of the Fourth Example:
For the input `10`, the code counts the transition `1->0` and sets the `flag` to `True`. Therefore, it decrements the count from 2 to 1, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because we need two pieces (`"1"` and `"0"`) to rearrange into `"01"`.

### Conclusion:
The code incorrectly handles the case where the string has only one transition from '1' to '0'. In such cases, it incorrectly decrements the count, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
