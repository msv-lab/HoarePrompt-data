Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `s` is the new input string with length greater than 2, `j` is 2, `count` is either 3 or 4, and `flag` is True.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `flag` is explicitly set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values.
