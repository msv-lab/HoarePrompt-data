You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        s = input()

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s` (adjusted by subtracting 1 if there is at least one '01' transition) has been printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum number of pieces a binary string can be cut into, such that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations:
- If the string is already sorted, only one piece is needed.
- Every time there is a transition from '1' to '0', we need an additional piece because we cannot have a '0' after a '1' in the final sorted string.
- However, every transition from '0' to '1' does not necessarily require an additional piece because we can rearrange the pieces to place all '0's before all '1's.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize `count` to 1 because at least one piece is always needed.
2. Traverse the string and increment `count` whenever there is a transition from '1' to '0'.
3. If there is at least one transition from '1' to '0', decrement `count` by 1 because the last piece can be merged with the previous piece without violating the sorted order.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided code to see if it follows this logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: `count` is initialized to 1, which is correct.
2. **Loop through the string**: The loop iterates through the string checking for transitions.
3. **Counting Transitions**:
   - When `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, it means there is a transition.
   - `count` is incremented for every transition.
   - If the transition is from '0' to '1', `flag` is set to `True`.
4. **Adjusting Count**:
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it means there was at least one transition from '1' to '0'.
   - In this case, `count` is decremented by 1 because the last piece can be merged with the previous piece without violating the sorted order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the algorithm to find the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. The logic and implementation match the problem requirements.
