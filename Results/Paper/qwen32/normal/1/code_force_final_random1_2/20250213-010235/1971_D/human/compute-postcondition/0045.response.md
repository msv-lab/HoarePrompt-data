Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string with length greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `count` is either 2 or 3.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so if `count` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if `count` was initially 2, it becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
