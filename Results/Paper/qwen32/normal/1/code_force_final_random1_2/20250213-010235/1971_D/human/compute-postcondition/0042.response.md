Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string with length greater than 1, `j` is 0, and `count` is either 1 or 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, `count` is 2. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', `flag` is True; otherwise, `flag` remains False.**
