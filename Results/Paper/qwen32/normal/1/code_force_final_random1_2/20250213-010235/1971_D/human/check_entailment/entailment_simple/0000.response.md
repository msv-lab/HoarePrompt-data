### Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) we can cut a binary string into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

The key observation here is that every time we encounter a transition from '0' to '1', we need to make a cut, because the '0's and '1's need to be separated in the final sorted string. However, if there is at least one '01' transition, we can merge the last piece containing '0's with the first piece containing '1's after rearrangement, thus reducing the total number of pieces by one.

Let's break down the logic of the provided code:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `count` is initialized to 1 because even if there are no transitions, we need at least one piece.
   - `flag` is used to check if there is at least one '01' transition.
   
2. **Loop through the string**:
   - For each character in the string (except the last one), the code checks if the current character is different from the next one.
   - If a difference is found (`s[j] != s[j + 1]`), it means a transition has occurred, and `count` is incremented.
   - If the transition is specifically from '0' to '1', `flag` is set to `True`.

3. **Adjust the count**:
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it means there was at least one '01' transition, so we can reduce the `count` by 1 because we can merge the last piece of '0's with the first piece of '1's after rearrangement.

4. **Output the result**:
   - For each test case, the adjusted `count` is printed.

This approach correctly counts the necessary cuts and adjusts for the possibility of merging the last '0's with the first '1's, ensuring the minimum number of pieces required.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string.

**Correctness: True**
