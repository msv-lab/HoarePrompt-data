To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `j < len(s) - 1`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500 (This variable does not affect the loop condition, so we do not need to adjust it.)
- `i` is 0 (This variable does not affect the loop condition, so we do not need to adjust it.)
- `s` is the input string with length greater than 1 (This variable affects the loop condition, but its length is fixed, so we don't need to change it.)
- `j` is 3 (This variable directly affects the loop condition.)

The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still satisfy the condition `j < len(s) - 1`.

Since `s` has a length greater than 1, let's denote the length of `s` as `L`. The condition `j < len(s) - 1` translates to `3 < L - 1`, which simplifies to `4 < L`. This means that the length of the string `s` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`, `i`, or `s` itself, but we need to ensure that the length of `s` is at least 4. Since `j` is already 3, it will be incremented in the next iteration, and the loop will continue as long as `j` remains less than `len(s) - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `i` is 0, `s` is the input string with length greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 3**
