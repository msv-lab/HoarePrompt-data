To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider how the variables evolve with each iteration and how the loop terminates.

### Loop Analysis:

- **Loop Head**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the initial number of test cases.
- **Loop Body**:
  - `n`: Number of integers in the current test case.
  - `arr`: String formed by concatenating the input line with all whitespace removed.
  - `x`: Index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
  - `y`: Index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`. This is found by reversing the array and finding the first '1', then converting it back to the original index.
  - `z`: Substring of `arr` from index `x` up to, but not including, index `n - y`.
  - The loop prints the count of '0's in the substring `z`.

### Output State After All Iterations:

After all iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` test cases. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will reflect the state of the last test case processed. However, since the loop processes each test case independently and does not retain any information across iterations, the final state of these variables will correspond to the last test case.

### Final Output State:

- `t` will be 0 because the loop will have executed `t` times and will terminate.
- `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will reflect the values from the last test case processed.

Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions, we focus on the fact that the loop has completed all iterations. The final output state will be characterized by the fact that the loop has terminated, and the variables will reflect the last processed test case.

Output State: **The loop has terminated after processing `t` test cases. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` reflect the state of the last test case processed.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and the variables hold the values from the last test case.
