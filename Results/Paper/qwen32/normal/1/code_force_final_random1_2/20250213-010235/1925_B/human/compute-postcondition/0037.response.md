Postcondition: **`ans` is 1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `x // i > 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `x` remains an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, and `x` is divisible by `i`. If the condition `x % i == 0` is not met, `ans` retains its previous value.**
