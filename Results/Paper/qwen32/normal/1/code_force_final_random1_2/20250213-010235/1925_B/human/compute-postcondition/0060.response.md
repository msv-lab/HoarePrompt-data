Postcondition: **`x` is an integer that must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions, or 1 if no such divisor exists, `q` is `q + 1`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i` if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, and `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). Additionally, `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)` is 0.**
