To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided:

Initial State: the largest divisor `d` of `x` that satisfies the conditions, or 1 if no such divisor exists.

From this statement, it's clear that there is a variable `ans` which holds the value of the largest divisor `d` of `x` that meets certain conditions. If no such divisor exists, `ans` will hold the value 1.

However, the specific conditions that `d` must satisfy are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the value of `ans` in terms of these conditions.

Given this information, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is either the largest divisor `d` of `x` that satisfies the conditions or 1 if no such divisor exists.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor d of x that satisfies the conditions, or 1 if no such divisor exists)**
