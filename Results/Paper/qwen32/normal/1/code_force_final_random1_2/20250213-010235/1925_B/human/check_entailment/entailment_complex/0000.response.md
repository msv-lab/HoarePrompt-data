### Reasoning:

The program aims to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset where the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals `x` and there are `n` sub-problems. The key idea is to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`.

Here's how the program works:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
3. It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible balance.
4. It iterates through all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - It also checks the corresponding larger divisor `x // i` in a similar manner.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum balance found for each test case.

The logic behind checking both `i` and `x // i` is to ensure that all divisors of `x` are considered, not just those less than or equal to the square root of `x`.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - Possible divisors: 1, 2, 5, 10
   - Checking:
     - For `i = 1`: `x - n * i = 10 - 3 * 1 = 7` (not divisible by 1)
     - For `i = 2`: `x - n * i = 10 - 3 * 2 = 4` (divisible by 2)
     - For `i = 5`: `x - n * i = 10 - 3 * 5 = -5` (negative)
     - For `i = 10`: `x - n * i = 10 - 3 * 10 = -20` (negative)
   - Maximum balance: 2

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - Possible divisors: 1, 5
   - Checking:
     - For `i = 1`: `x - n * i = 5 - 5 * 1 = 0` (divisible by 1)
     - For `i = 5`: `x - n * i = 5 - 5 * 5 = -20` (negative)
   - Maximum balance: 1

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - Possible divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420
   - Checking:
     - For `i = 6`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 6 = 6` (divisible by 6)
     - For `i = 10`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 10 = -480` (negative)
     - For `i = 14`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 14 = -766` (negative)
     - For `i = 21`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 21 = -1109` (negative)
     - For `i = 30`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 30 = -1650` (negative)
     - For `i = 42`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 42 = -2358` (negative)
     - For `i = 60`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 60 = -3900` (negative)
     - For `i = 70`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 70 = -4410` (negative)
     - For `i = 105`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 105 = -6315` (negative)
     - For `i = 140`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 140 = -8340` (negative)
     - For `i = 210`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 210 = -12270` (negative)
     - For `i = 420`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 420 = -28980` (negative)
   - Maximum balance: 6
