The only variable in the loop head is `i`, as it is the iterating variable in the `range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1)` expression. The other variables (`ans`, `x`, `n`, `q`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the given task constraints.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` accordingly. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value.
2. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
3. The loop condition is `i < int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, so `i` must still satisfy this condition for the loop to execute again.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`ans` is either the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, or retains its previous value otherwise. `x` remains an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, `x` is divisible by `i`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, we express the new state in terms of `i_prev`:

State: **`ans` is either the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, or retains its previous value otherwise. `x` remains an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, `x` is divisible by `i`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `q` is `q_prev + 1`.**

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we simplify it to:

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`**
