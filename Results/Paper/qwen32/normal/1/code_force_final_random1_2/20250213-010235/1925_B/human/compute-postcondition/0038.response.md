To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, to find the state at the start of the next iteration, we simply need to increment `i` by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had some value.
2. The loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration.
3. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

The other variables (`ans`, `q`, `x`, `n`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` will be `k + 1`.

Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`ans` is 1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `x // i > 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `x` remains an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, and `x` is divisible by `i`. If the condition `x % i == 0` is not met, `ans` retains its previous value. `i` is `k + 1`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is 1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `x // i > 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `x` remains an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, and `x` is divisible by `i`. If the condition `x % i == 0` is not met, `ans` retains its previous value. `i` is `i + 1`**
