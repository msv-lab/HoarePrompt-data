The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `n`. The initial state mentions `ans` and `q`, but these variables are not modified by the given code snippet. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` such that `x - n * divisor` is non-negative and divisible by `divisor`, `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input.**
