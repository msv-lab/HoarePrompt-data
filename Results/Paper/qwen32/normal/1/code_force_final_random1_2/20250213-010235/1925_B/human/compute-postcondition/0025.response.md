To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is defined as the maximum divisor of `x` such that `x - n * divisor` is non-negative and divisible by `divisor`.

### Analysis:
- We need to find the maximum divisor of `x` that satisfies the condition `x - n * divisor >= 0` and `x - n * divisor % divisor == 0`.
- This implies that `x` must be divisible by `divisor` and `n * divisor` must be less than or equal to `x`.

### Steps to Determine `ans`:
1. Identify all divisors of `x`.
2. For each divisor, check if `x - n * divisor` is non-negative and divisible by `divisor`.
3. Select the maximum divisor that satisfies these conditions.

However, since the specific values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. Therefore, we can only describe `ans` based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum divisor of `x` such that `x - n * divisor` is non-negative and divisible by `divisor`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor of x such that x - n * divisor is non-negative and divisible by divisor)**
