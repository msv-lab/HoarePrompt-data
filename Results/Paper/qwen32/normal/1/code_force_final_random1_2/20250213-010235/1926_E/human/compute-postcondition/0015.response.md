The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Initially, `L` is `[m, m]`. After appending `m` to `L`, `L` becomes `[m, m, m]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `L` is `[m, m, m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
