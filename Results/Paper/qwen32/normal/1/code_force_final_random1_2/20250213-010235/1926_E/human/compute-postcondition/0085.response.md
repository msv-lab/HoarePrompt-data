Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State:
- `t` is 8
- `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is an input integer
- `L` is `[ (n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2 ]`
- `pow` is 1
- `tot` is 0
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

Code Snippet:
```python
L.append(m)
```

Impact of the code:
- The list `L` has an additional element appended to it, which is the value of `m`.

Calculating the new state:
- `t` remains 8.
- `n` remains `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- `k` remains an input integer.
- `L` was initially `[ (n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2 ]` and now becomes `[ (n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2 ]` because `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `pow` remains 1.
- `tot` remains 0.
- `m` remains `(n + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is 8, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is `[ (n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2 ]`, `pow` is 1, `tot` is 0, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
