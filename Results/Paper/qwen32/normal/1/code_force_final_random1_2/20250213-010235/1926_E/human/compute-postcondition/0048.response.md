The given code snippet reassigns the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. However, since `m` was already initialized with the same expression `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `m` does not change. Therefore, no actual change occurs in the state of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is 9, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an input integer, `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`, `pow` is 16, `tot` is 8, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
