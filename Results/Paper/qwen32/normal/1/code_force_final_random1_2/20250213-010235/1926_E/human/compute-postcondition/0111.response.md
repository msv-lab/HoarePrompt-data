The value of `g` is updated by adding `(h + 1) // 2` to its current value. Given `h` is 2, the expression `(h + 1) // 2` evaluates to `(2 + 1) // 2`, which is `3 // 2`, resulting in `1`. Therefore, `g` becomes `6 + 1`, which is `7`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is 8; `k` is 7; `s` is 8; `i` is 4; `d` is 0; `p` is 3; `g` is 7; `h` is 2; `y` is 2; `f` is not defined.**
