### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program step-by-step to see if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Sequence Lengths:**
   - The program calculates the lengths of sequences of cards that are multiples of increasing powers of 2.
   - It does this by repeatedly halving `n` and appending the result to the list `L`. This process continues until `n` becomes zero.
   - The idea here is to count how many cards will be placed in each sequence of multiples of powers of 2.

3. **Determining the k-th Card:**
   - The program initializes `tot` to 0, which keeps track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - It also initializes `pow` to 1, which represents the current power of 2 being considered.
   - The program iterates through the list `L`, checking if `k` falls within the range of the current sequence.
   - If `k` is within the range of the current sequence, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
   - It then updates `tot` and `pow` for the next iteration.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example where `n = 7` and `k = 1` to `k = 7`.

- **Sequence Lengths Calculation:**
  - `n = 7`
  - `m = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n = 7 - 4 = 3`, `L = [4]`
  - `m = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`, `n = 3 - 2 = 1`, `L = [4, 2]`
  - `m = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`, `n = 1 - 1 = 0`, `L = [4, 2, 1]`

- **Determining the k-th Card:**
  - For `k = 1`: `tot = 0`, `pow = 1`, `k` is in the range `[1, 4]`, so the card is `1 * (2 * (1 - 0) - 1) = 1`.
  - For `k = 2`: `tot = 0`, `pow = 1`, `k` is in the range `[1, 4]`, so the card is `1 * (2 * (2 - 0) - 1) = 3`.
  - For `k = 3`: `tot = 0`, `pow = 1`, `k` is in the range `[1, 4]`, so the card is `1 * (2 * (3 - 0) - 1) = 5`.
  - For `k = 4`: `tot = 0`, `pow = 1`, `k` is in the range `[1, 4]`, so the card is `1 * (2 * (4 - 0) - 1) = 7`.
  - For `k = 5`: `tot = 4`, `pow = 2`, `k` is in the range `[5, 6]`, so the card is `2 * (2 * (5 - 4) - 1) = 2`.
  - For `k = 6`: `tot = 4`, `pow = 2`, `k` is in the range `[5, 6]`, so the card is `2 * (2 * (6 - 4) - 1) = 6`.
  - For `k = 7`: `tot = 6`, `pow = 4`, `k` is in the range `[7, 7]`, so the card is `4 * (2 * (7 - 6) - 1) = 4`.

The results match the expected output for the first 7 test cases.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and verification, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
