Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; if `k > (n + 1) // 2`, then `s` is 8, `i` is 4, `d` is 0, `p` is 5, `g` is 8, `h` is 0, `y` is -24, and `f` is -1. Otherwise, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `h` is `n`, `y` is not defined, and `f` is not defined. Additionally, if `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `k` retains its original value.**
