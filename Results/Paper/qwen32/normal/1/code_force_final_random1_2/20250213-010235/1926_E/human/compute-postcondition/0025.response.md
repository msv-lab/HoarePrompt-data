The only variable in the loop head is `a`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `L`. If `L` has at least two elements, the loop will execute again for the second element.

At the end of the last iteration, `L` has at least one element, and `a` was the first element of `L`. For the loop to execute one more time, `L` must have at least two elements, and `a` should be the second element of `L`.

State: **`t` is 10, `n` is 0, `k` is 3, `L` is a list with at least two elements (e.g., `[4, 5]`), `pow` is 2, `tot` is `tot + a`, `a` is the second element of `L`**
