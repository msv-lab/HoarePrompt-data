Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 8
- `n` is 0
- `k` is an input integer (we don't know its specific value, so we'll keep it as `k`)
- `L` is a list with at least two values (we don't know its specific values, so we'll keep it as `L`)
- `pow` is 2
- `tot` is `tot + a` (This statement seems incorrect as it suggests `tot` is being updated but `a` is not defined in the initial state. We'll assume `tot` is initially 0 and `a` is not used in this context.)

### Print Statement:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
- `pow` is explicitly given as 2.
- `tot` is not clearly defined in the initial state, but since it is mentioned as `tot = tot + a` and `a` is not defined, we'll assume `tot` is 0 (as no other information is given).
- `k` is an input integer, so we'll keep it as `k`.

Let's substitute these values into the print statement:

1. `tot` is assumed to be 0.
2. The expression inside the print statement becomes:
   \[
   pow \times (2 \times (k - tot) - 1)
   \]
3. Substituting `pow` and `tot`:
   \[
   2 \times (2 \times (k - 0) - 1) = 2 \times (2k - 1)
   \]

### Final Expression:
The final expression simplifies to:
\[
2 \times (2k - 1) = 4k - 2
\]

### Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `4k - 2`.

Output: **4k - 2 (where k is the input integer)**
