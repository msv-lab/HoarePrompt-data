Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

- `t` is 9
- `n` is 0
- `k` is an input integer (its exact value is not specified)
- `L` is a list with at least two elements (the specific elements are not provided)
- `pow` is 4
- `tot` is `2 * a_next` (the value of `a_next` is not provided)
- `a` is `a_next_next` (the value of `a_next_next` is not provided)

The print statement is:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

To determine what will be printed, let's substitute the known values into the expression:

1. `pow` is 4.
2. `tot` is `2 * a_next` (we don't know `a_next`, so we'll keep it as `2 * a_next`).
3. `k` is an input integer (we don't know its value, so we'll keep it as `k`).

Substituting these into the expression inside the print statement, we get:
```python
print(4 * (2 * (k - 2 * a_next) - 1))
```

This expression cannot be simplified further without knowing the values of `k` and `a_next`.

Therefore, the output will be described in terms of `k` and `a_next`.

Output: **4 * (2 * (k - 2 * a_next) - 1) (where k is the input integer and a_next is the value used to compute tot)**
