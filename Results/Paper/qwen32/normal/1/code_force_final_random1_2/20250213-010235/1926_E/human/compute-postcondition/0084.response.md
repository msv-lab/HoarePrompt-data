The value of `n` is decremented by `m`. Given that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`.

Since `n` must be greater than 1, let's denote the original value of `n` as `n_original`. After the operation, `n` becomes `n_original - (n_original + 1) // 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 8, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is `[ (n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2 ]`, `pow` is 1, `tot` is 0, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
