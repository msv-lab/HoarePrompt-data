Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 52, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. If `n` is greater than 26, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. Otherwise, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'`.**
