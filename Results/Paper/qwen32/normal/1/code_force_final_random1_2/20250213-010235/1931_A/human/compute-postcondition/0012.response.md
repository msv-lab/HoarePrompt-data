Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 27] + 'z'`. If `n` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 1]`.**
