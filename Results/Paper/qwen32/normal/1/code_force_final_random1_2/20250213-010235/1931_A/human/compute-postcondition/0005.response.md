The code snippet appends a character from the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz' to the `word` string. Given that `n` is an input integer greater than 52, we can determine the character appended from the `alphabet` string.

Since `alphabet` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', the index `n - 53` will map to the appropriate character in the `alphabet`. For example, if `n` is 53, `n - 53` is 0, which corresponds to 'a'; if `n` is 54, `n - 53` is 1, which corresponds to 'b', and so on.

Thus, the `word` string will be updated to contain the character at position `n - 53` in the `alphabet` followed by 'zz'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 52, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.**
