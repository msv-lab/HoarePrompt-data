### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that can be encoded to a given integer `n`. The encoding is done by summing the positions of the letters in the alphabet. 

Let's break down the logic of the provided code:

1. **Alphabet Mapping**: The code uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to map the letters 'a' to 'z' to their respective positions (0 to 25).

2. **Logic for Constructing the Word**:
   - If `n > 52`: The code constructs a word starting with the letter at position `n - 53` (since the maximum sum of two 'z's is 52) and appends 'zz'. This ensures that the first letter is the smallest possible while still reaching the sum `n`.
   - If `26 < n <= 52`: The code constructs a word starting with 'a', followed by the letter at position `n - 28` (since 'a' contributes 1, and the maximum sum of 'z' is 26), and appends 'z'.
   - If `n <= 26`: The code constructs a word starting with 'aa' and appending the letter at position `n - 3`.

Let's verify this logic against the provided examples:

- **For `n = 24`**: The code should produce "aav". The sum is 1 (for 'a') + 1 (for 'a') + 22 (for 'v') = 24. This matches the requirement.
- **For `n = 70`**: The code should produce "rzz". The sum is 18 (for 'r') + 26 (for 'z') + 26 (for 'z') = 70. This matches the requirement.
- **For `n = 3`**: The code should produce "aaa". The sum is 1 (for 'a') + 1 (for 'a') + 1 (for 'a') = 3. This matches the requirement.
- **For `n = 55`**: The code should produce "czz". The sum is 3 (for 'c') + 26 (for 'z') + 26 (for 'z') = 55. This matches the requirement.
- **For `n = 48`**: The code should produce "auz". The sum is 1 (for 'a') + 21 (for 'u') + 26 (for 'z') = 48. This matches the requirement.

All the test cases match the expected results, indicating that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly determines the lexicographically smallest word for each given encoded integer `n`.

Correctness: **True**
