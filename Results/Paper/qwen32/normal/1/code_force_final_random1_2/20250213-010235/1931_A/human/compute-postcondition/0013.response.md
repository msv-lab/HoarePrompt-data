To determine the output of the `print(word)` statement, let's analyze the conditions and derive the value of `word` based on the value of `n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 (though `t` is not used in determining `word`).
- `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100.
- `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

The value of `word` is determined by the following conditions:
1. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
2. If `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 27] + 'z'`.
3. If `n` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 1]`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

- For `n` between 1 and 26 (inclusive):
  - `word` will be `'aa' + alphabet[n - 1]`.
  - For example, if `n` is 1, `word` will be `'aa' + 'a'` which is `'aaa'`.
  - If `n` is 26, `word` will be `'aa' + 'z'` which is `'aaz'`.

- For `n` between 27 and 52 (inclusive):
  - `word` will be `'a' + alphabet[n - 27] + 'z'`.
  - For example, if `n` is 27, `word` will be `'a' + 'a' + 'z'` which is `'aaz'`.
  - If `n` is 52, `word` will be `'a' + 'z' + 'z'` which is `'azz'`.

- For `n` between 53 and 100 (inclusive):
  - `word` will be `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
  - For example, if `n` is 53, `word` will be `'a' + 'zz'` which is `'azz'`.
  - If `n` is 100, `word` will be `'ed' + 'zz'` which is `'edzz'`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we need to describe the output in terms of the conditions provided.

Output: **word (where word is determined by the value of n: 'aa' + alphabet[n - 1] if 1 <= n <= 26, 'a' + alphabet[n - 27] + 'z' if 27 <= n <= 52, and alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz' if 53 <= n <= 100)**
