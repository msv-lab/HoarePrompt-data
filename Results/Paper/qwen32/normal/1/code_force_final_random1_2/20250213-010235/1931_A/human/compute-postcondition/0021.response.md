Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` > 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is between 1 and 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'`.**
