The code snippet concatenates the string `'a'`, the character from the `alphabet` string at index `n - 28`, and the string `'z'` to the `word` variable. Given that `n` is an integer greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52, `n - 28` will be a value between -2 and 24. Since `alphabet` only contains lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', the valid indices for `alphabet` are from 0 to 25. Therefore, `n - 28` will map to indices 0 through 24, corresponding to the letters 'a' through 'y'.

Thus, `word` will become `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. For example, if `n` is 28, `word` will be `'aaz'`; if `n` is 29, `word` will be `'aba'`, and so on up to `'ayz'` when `n` is 52.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`**
