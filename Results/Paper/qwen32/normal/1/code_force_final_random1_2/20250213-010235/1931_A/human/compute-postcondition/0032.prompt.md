Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 26:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 27] + 'z'`. If `n` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` > 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is between 1 and 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is 4, and `word` is constructed as follows: if `n` > 52, `word` is the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'; if `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`; otherwise, if `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
