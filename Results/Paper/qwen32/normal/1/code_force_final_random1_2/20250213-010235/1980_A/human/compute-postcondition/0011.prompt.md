Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `m` is the second element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the third element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `freq` is a list of 7 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for prob in a:
    freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the _th tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where one element has been incremented by 1 compared to its initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the _th tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where two elements have been incremented by 1 compared to its initial state (one was incremented before and one is incremented by the current line of code), `prob` is the next character in the string `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the _th tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where three elements have been incremented by 1 (two were incremented before and one is incremented by the current line of code), `prob` is the next character in the string `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
