The only object in the loop head is the variable `prob`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `a`. If there are more characters in the string `a`, the loop will execute again for the next character.

At the end of the last iteration, `prob` is the current character from the string `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `prob` should be the next character in the string `a`.

Let's denote the current position in the string `a` as `pos`. At the end of the last iteration, `pos` would be the index of `prob` in the string `a`. For the next iteration, `pos` should be incremented by 1, and `prob` should be the character at this new position.

Given the information, we can infer that `pos` is implicitly managed by the loop, and we only need to adjust `prob` to the next character in the string `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a string `a` of length at least 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the _th tuple in `test_cases` and has at least one character, `freq` is a list with one element incremented by 1 (specific index depends on `prob`), `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in freq, `_` is incremented by 1, `prob` is the next character in the string `a`**
