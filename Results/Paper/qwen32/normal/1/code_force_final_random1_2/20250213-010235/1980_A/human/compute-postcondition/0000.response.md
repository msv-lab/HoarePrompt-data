Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. No changes were made to the variables as no operations were performed on them.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet is a docstring that describes the function's purpose, arguments, and return value. It does not contain any executable code that would alter the initial state of the variables `t` and `test_cases`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
