You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, printing `t` values based on the condition `4 * n - 2 == k`. Each value is either `k // 2 + 1` if the condition is true, or `ceil(k / 2)` if the condition is false.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on whether `k` equals `4 * n - 2`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell. The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

### Key Observations

1. **Diagonal Counting**: 
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right.
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.
   - Total diagonals: \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Minimum Cells Needed**:
   - If \( k \leq 2n - 1 \), we can cover \( k \) diagonals using \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) cells. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one from each direction).
   - If \( k > 2n - 1 \), we need to cover more than half of the diagonals. In this case, we can use the symmetry of the grid. We can cover \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals with \( n \) cells (one cell per row or column). For the remaining diagonals, we need additional cells. However, the formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) still holds because it accounts for the fact that each additional diagonal might require a new cell.

3. **Special Case**:
   - When \( k = 4n - 2 \), we need to cover all diagonals. According to the formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \), this would result in \( 2n - 1 \) cells, but since we can cover all diagonals with \( n \) cells (one per row or column), the correct answer is \( n \). However, the problem specifies that when \( k = 4n - 2 \), the answer should be \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \), which simplifies to \( 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n \). This seems incorrect based on the problem statement, but let's verify with the examples.

### Verification with Examples

- **Test Case 1**: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
  - Correct according to the example.

- **Test Case 2**: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
  - Correct according to the example.

- **Test Case 3**: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{10}{2} \rceil = 5 \)
  - Incorrect according to the example (should be 6).

- **Test Case 4**: \( n = 3, k = 9 \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{9}{2} \rceil = 5 \)
  - Correct according to the example.

- **Test Case 5**: \( n = 4, k = 7 \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{7}{2} \rceil = 4 \)
  - Correct according to the example.

- **Test Case 6**: \( n = 7, k = 11 \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{11}{2} \rceil = 6 \)
  - Correct according to the example.

- **Test Case 7**: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
  - Correct according to the example.

### Conclusion

The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) works correctly for most cases, but there seems to be a discrepancy in the special case where \( k = 4n - 2 \). However, based on the examples provided, the formula appears to be correct for all other cases.

Given the examples and the general logic, the provided program seems to be correct for the given problem constraints.
