Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `s` is the next line from the input file; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from splitting and mapping the string `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to \(4 \times n - 4\), no further action is taken. If `k` equals \(4 \times n - 3\) or \(4 \times n - 2\), no further action is taken. Otherwise, no further action is taken.**
