Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers.
- The relationship `4 * n - 2 = k` holds.

We need to determine the output of the following print statement:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. From the relationship `4 * n - 2 = k`, we can express `k` in terms of `n`:
   \[
   k = 4n - 2
   \]

2. Substitute this expression for `k` into the print statement:
   \[
   \text{print}((4n - 2) // 2 + 1)
   \]

3. Simplify the expression inside the print statement:
   \[
   (4n - 2) // 2 + 1 = (4n // 2 - 2 // 2) + 1 = (2n - 1) + 1 = 2n
   \]

Therefore, the print statement simplifies to:
\[
\text{print}(2n)
\]

This means the output will be twice the value of `n`.

Output: **2n (where n is the integer read from the input)**
