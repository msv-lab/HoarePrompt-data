In this task, the loop iterates over lines from standard input starting from the second line (index 1). The loop variable `s` represents each line as a string. Since `s` is no longer relevant after being split and mapped into `n` and `k`, we only need to consider how the loop will proceed to the next iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable `s` will take the value of the next line in the input file during each iteration. Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to ensure that there is another line available in the input.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from splitting and mapping the string `s`; `s` is no longer relevant.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another line in the input file.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from splitting and mapping the string `s` from the previous iteration; `s` is the next line from the input file.** 

Since `s` is the loop variable and it takes the next line in each iteration, we don't need to specify its value explicitly other than noting that it will be the next line from the input. The values of `n` and `k` are derived from this new `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `s` is the next line from the input file; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from splitting and mapping the new string `s`.**
