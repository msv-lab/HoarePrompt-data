The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` does not affect the loop condition, we only need to adjust `t` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is some integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1. The values of `n` and `k` do not change based on the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. If `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, then the condition is true; otherwise, the condition is false.**
