The code snippet `count_num += 1` increments the value of `count_num` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `count_num`, we can only say that its value is increased by 1. The values of `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 20, `end` is 50, `num` is [100, 200], `count_num` is increased by 1.**
