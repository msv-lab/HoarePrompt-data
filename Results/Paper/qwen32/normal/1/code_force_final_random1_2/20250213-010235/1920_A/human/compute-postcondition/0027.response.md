Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State: 
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `t` is the first integer from the input
- `v` is the second integer from the input
- `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged
- if `t == 2` and `end > v`, then `end` is set to `v`
- `num` is `[v]` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` remains `[]`
- `i` is incremented by 1. If `t` is not equal to 1, none of these changes occur

Code Snippet:
```python
num.append(v)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The code appends `v` to the list `num`.

Since the code snippet `num.append(v)` is executed regardless of the value of `t`, we need to consider the initial state of `num`:
- If `t` was 3, `num` was initially `[v]`. After appending `v`, `num` becomes `[v, v]`.
- If `t` was not 3, `num` was initially `[]`. After appending `v`, `num` becomes `[v]`.

Other variables (`n`, `t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged; if `t == 2` and `end > v`, then `end` is set to `v`; `num` is `[v, v]` if `t` was 3, otherwise `num` is `[v]`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `t` is not equal to 1, none of these changes occur except `num` is now `[v]` or `[v, v]`.**
