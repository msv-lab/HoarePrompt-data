Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged; if `t == 2` and `end > v`, then `end` is set to `v`; `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3, and `num` is `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3; `i` is incremented by 1. If `t` is not equal to 1, none of these changes occur except `num` is now `[v]` or `[v, v]`.**
