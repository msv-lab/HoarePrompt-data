Output State: **`start` is 20, `end` is 50, `num` is [100, 200], `count_num` is 0, the current value of `i` is either less than 20 or greater than 50, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Natural Language: The values of `start`, `end`, `num`, and `count_num` remain unchanged. The loop continues to the next iteration, and the condition for `i` being either less than 20 or greater than 50 is still valid.
