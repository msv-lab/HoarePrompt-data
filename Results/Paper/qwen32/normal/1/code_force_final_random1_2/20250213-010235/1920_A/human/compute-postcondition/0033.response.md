Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged; `end` is conditionally set based on `t` and `v`; `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3, and `num` is `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3; `i` is `i + 1`. If `t == 1`, the same conditions apply as described above. If `t != 1`, the `end` is not modified based on the condition `end > v`.**
