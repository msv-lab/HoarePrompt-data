To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `t` is the first integer from the input
- `v` is the second integer from the input
- `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged
- If `t == 2` and `end > v`, then `end` is set to `v`
- `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3, and `num` is `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3
- `i` is incremented by 1
- If `t` is not equal to 1, none of these changes occur except `num` is now `[v]` or `[v, v]`

Since only `i` and `n` can be adjusted, and `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1` (from the end of the previous iteration).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is now `i + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1` (which is the same condition as before, but now with the updated `i`)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged, if `t == 2` and `end > v`, then `end` is set to `v`, `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3, and `num` is `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3, `i` is `i + 1`**
