The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of the list `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last element of `num`, which is 200. Since there are no more elements in `num` to iterate over, the loop cannot execute again.

However, if we consider the hypothetical scenario where there are more elements in `num` to iterate over, we would adjust `i` to the next element in the list. But given the current state, there are no more elements.

Since the loop cannot execute again with the current state of `num`, we don't need to adjust any states. The state remains as it is.

State: **`start` is 20, `end` is 50, `num` is [100, 200]**
