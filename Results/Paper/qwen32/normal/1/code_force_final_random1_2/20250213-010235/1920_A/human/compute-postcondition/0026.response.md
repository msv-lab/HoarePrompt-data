Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged; if `t == 2` and `end > v`, then `end` is set to `v`; `num` is `[v]` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` remains `[]`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `t` is not equal to 1, none of these changes occur.**
