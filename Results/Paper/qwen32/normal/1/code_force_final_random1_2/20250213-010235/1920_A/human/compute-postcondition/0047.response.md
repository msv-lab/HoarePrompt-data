The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements in the list `num`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element in the list `num`, which is 200. Since there are no more elements in the list `num` to iterate over, the loop will not execute again regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, or `count_num`.

However, if we were to consider the hypothetical scenario where there are more elements in the list `num` to iterate over, we would adjust `i` to the next element in the list. But given the current state, there are no further iterations possible.

Since the task specifies to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head and there are no more elements in `num`, the loop terminates.

State: **`start` is 20, `end` is 50, `num` is [100, 200]** (no change needed as the loop terminates)
