isOne is a boolean value indicating whether the function should handle a single test case (if True) or multiple test cases (if False). However, based on the problem description, the function `input_n` does not directly relate to the input variables described. The actual input variables are t (number of test cases), n (number of constraints per test case), and a series of constraints (a, x) where a is the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3) and x is the integer associated with the constraint. Therefore, the precondition for the main logic handling the constraints would be: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; and for each constraint, a is an integer such that a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
