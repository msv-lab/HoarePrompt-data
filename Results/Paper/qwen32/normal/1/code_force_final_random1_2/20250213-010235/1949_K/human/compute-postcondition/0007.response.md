The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. Since `num` is currently the second element of `numbers`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be updated to the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the second element of `numbers`. For the next iteration, `num` should be the third element of `numbers`.

Here's how the state would look at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a` contains the first element of `numbers`, `group_b` contains the second element of `numbers`, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is equal to the first element of `numbers`, `sum_b` is equal to the second element of `numbers`, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the third element of `numbers`**
