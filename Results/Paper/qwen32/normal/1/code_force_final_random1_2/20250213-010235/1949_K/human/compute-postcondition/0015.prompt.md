You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the total number of integers, na, nb, and nc are positive integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that na + nb + nc = n, and numbers is a list of n positive integers.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a` contains the first `na` elements of `numbers`, `group_b` contains the next `nb` elements of `numbers`, `group_c` contains the last `nc` elements of `numbers`, `sum_a` is the sum of the first `na` elements of `numbers`, `sum_b` is the sum of the next `nb` elements of `numbers`, `sum_c` is the sum of the last `nc` elements of `numbers`.
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns ('YES', group_a, group_b, group_c) where group_a contains the first `na` elements of `numbers`, group_b contains the next `nb` elements of `numbers`, and group_c contains the last `nc` elements of `numbers`.
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts five parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the total number of integers), `na` (a positive integer representing the size of the first group), `nb` (a positive integer representing the size of the second group), `nc` (a positive integer representing the size of the third group), and `numbers` (a list of `n` positive integers). If `na + nb + nc` equals `n`, the function returns a tuple containing 'YES', `group_a` (the first `na` elements of `numbers`), `group_b` (the next `nb` elements of `numbers`), and `group_c` (the last `nc` elements of `numbers`). Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns ('YES', group_a, group_b, group_c) where group_a contains the first `na` elements of `numbers`, group_b contains the next `nb` elements of `numbers`, and group_c contains the last `nc` elements of `numbers`.

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
