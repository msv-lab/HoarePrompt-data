The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which iterates over the elements in the list `numbers`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.
- `group_a` contains the first element of `numbers`.
- `group_b` and `group_c` are empty lists.
- `sum_a` is equal to the first element of `numbers`.
- `sum_b` and `sum_c` are 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` would have taken the value of the first element in `numbers`. For the next iteration, `num` should take the value of the next element in the list `numbers`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a` contains the first element of `numbers`, `group_b` and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a` is equal to the first element of `numbers`, `sum_b` and `sum_c` are 0, `num` is the second element of `numbers`**.
