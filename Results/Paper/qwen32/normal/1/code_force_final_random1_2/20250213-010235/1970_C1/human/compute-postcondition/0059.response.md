Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts two integer parameters, `start` and `target`, representing nodes in a tree, and an adjacency list `tree` representing the tree structure. The function performs a breadth-first search starting from the `start` node to find the shortest path to the `target` node. It returns 0 if `start` is equal to `target`. If a path is found, it returns the distance (`dist`) to the `target` node. If no path is found, it returns -1.**
