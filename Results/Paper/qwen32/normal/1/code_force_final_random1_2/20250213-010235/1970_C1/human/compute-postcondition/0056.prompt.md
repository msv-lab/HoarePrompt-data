Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `queue` has one less element, `current` holds the first element of the removed tuple, and `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple. The `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree. If `current` equals the `target`, the program returns `dist`. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues executing.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `queue` has one less element initially, `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors, `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple, and `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` gains one more element, which is a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, no changes occur to `queue` or `visited`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `queue` has one more element if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged. `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors, `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple, `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; otherwise, `visited` remains unchanged. `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current` in `tree[current]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `queue` has one more element `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged. `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors. `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple. `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree including the previous `neighbor` if it was not in `visited`; otherwise, `visited` remains unchanged. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it is now included in `visited`. `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current` in `tree[current]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
