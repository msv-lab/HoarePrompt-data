Output State: **`queue` has one less element initially, `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors, `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple, `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree except for at least one `neighbor` of `current` (previously true, now `visited` includes `neighbor`), `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current` in `tree[current]`.**

Natural Language: The `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node, which was previously unvisited. All other conditions remain unchanged.
