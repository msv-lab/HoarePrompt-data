The code snippet provided appends the integer `b` to the list stored in `lst` under the key `a`. This means that `lst[a]` will now include `b` as one of its elements, along with any previous elements it had.

Here's the updated state:

- `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5.
- `t` remains an integer equal to 1.
- The tree representation by `n-1` edges remains unchanged.
- The tree having exactly two leaves remains unchanged.
- The starting node for each round remains unchanged.
- `x` remains at least 1.
- `y` remains an integer read from the input.
- `lst` is now updated such that `lst[a]` includes `b`.
- `rev` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it.
- `a` and `b` remain the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the starting node for each round, `x` is at least 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `lst[a]` now includes `b` along with any previous elements it had, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `rev[b]` now includes `a` and any previous elements it had, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
