You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n. tree is an adjacency list representation of the tree with n nodes and n-1 edges, and it is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: queue is empty, visited contains all nodes in the tree, current holds the last node processed, and dist holds the distance to the last node processed.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `bfs` accepts two integer parameters, `start` and `target`, representing nodes in a tree, and an adjacency list `tree` representing the tree structure. The function performs a breadth-first search starting from the `start` node to find the shortest path to the `target` node. It returns 0 if `start` is equal to `target`. If a path is found, it returns the distance (`dist`) to the `target` node. If no path is found, it returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns `dist`, which is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue.

Case_3: The program returns `dist`, which holds the second element of the removed tuple from the queue.

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
