The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state does not specify any values for `x` and `y`, so these variables are being defined here. The values of `n`, `t`, the tree structure, and the starting node(s) for each round remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the starting node for each round. `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.**
