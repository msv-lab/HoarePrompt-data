The code snippet `two = not two` flips the boolean value of the variable `two`. Given that the initial state specifies `two` is `False`, after executing the code, `two` will become `True`.

The other variables (`tmp`, `rev[z]`, and `rev[tmp]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`tmp` is the last element of `rev[z]` before it was popped; `rev[z]` is now missing its last element; `two` is `True`; `rev[tmp]` must not be an empty list**.
