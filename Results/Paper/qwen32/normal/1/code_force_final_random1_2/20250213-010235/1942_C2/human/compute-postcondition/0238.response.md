The code snippet assigns a value to `next_elem` based on the condition `if i == x - 1`. If the condition is true, `next_elem` is set to `a[0] + n`; otherwise, it is set to `a[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state, `x` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `next_elem` depends on whether `i` equals `x - 1`.

- If `i == x - 1`, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
- Otherwise, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i + 1 == x - 1` else `a[i + 2]`**.

In simpler terms, `x` remains greater than 0, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `next_elem` is determined by whether the new `i` (which is `i + 1`) equals `x - 1`. If it does, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`; otherwise, `next_elem` is `a[i + 2]`.
