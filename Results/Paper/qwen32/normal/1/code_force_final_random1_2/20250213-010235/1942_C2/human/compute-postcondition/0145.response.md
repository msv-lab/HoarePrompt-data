The given code snippet modifies the variable `sx` by adding the value of `i` to it. The other variables (`val`, `i`, `y`, and `c`) remain unchanged in terms of their described properties unless explicitly modified.

Here's the breakdown:
- `val` remains a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order.
- `i` remains `i_next`.
- `y` has already been decreased by `c` (where `c` was `i_current // 2`), and if `y < c`, `sx` has been recalculated and increased by `y * 2`. This operation does not affect `y` further in the given snippet.
- `c` is recalculated as `i_next // 2` but is not used further in the snippet.

The only change is to `sx`, which is incremented by `i`.

Output State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_next`; `y` is decreased by `c` (where `c` was `i_current // 2`) and then, if `y < c`, `sx` is recalculated based on the new values of `y` and `c` and increased by `y * 2`; `c` is `i_next // 2`; `sx` is increased by `i`.**
