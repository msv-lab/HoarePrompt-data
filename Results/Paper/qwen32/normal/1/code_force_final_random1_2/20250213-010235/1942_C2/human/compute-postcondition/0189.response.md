Postcondition: **`ans` is `(x - 2) + count + sum(odd) + gap + 2 * y` if `y < gap // 2`, otherwise `ans` remains `(x - 2) + count + sum(odd) + gap`. `y` is `0` if `y < gap // 2`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged. `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1, `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 and must have at least one element, `gap` is the next element in the `even` list.**
