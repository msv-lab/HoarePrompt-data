Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is 4. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1 from its initial value. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is reduced by `((a[4] - a[3]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` contains `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]`, and `ans` is updated by adding `(a[4] - a[3]) // 2` to its previous value. If neither condition is met, `y` remains unchanged, `tmp` is an empty list, and `ans` is updated as per the original rules: `ans` is `x + y - 1` if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2`.**
