Output State: **`odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even.**

Explanation: The `even` list was sorted, but since it already contained all gaps greater than 0 and even, sorting it does not change its content. The `odd` list remains unchanged as it was already sorted and contains all gaps greater than 1 and odd.
