Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is the final computed value after all iterations. If the sum of the first element of `a` plus `n` minus the last element of `a` equals 2, then `ans` has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, the sum of `a[0]`, `n`, and the negative of `a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` includes the addition of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `tmp` includes `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. `tmp` is a list of half the even differences where the condition on `y` was satisfied; `y` is the remaining value after all decrements.**
