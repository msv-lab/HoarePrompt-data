Output State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_new`; `c` is `i_new // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is calculated as the integer division of `i` by 2, which is `i_new // 2`. The other variables (`val` and `i`) remain unchanged.
