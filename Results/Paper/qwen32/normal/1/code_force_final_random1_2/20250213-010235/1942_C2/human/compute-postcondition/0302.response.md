Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three additional integers: `n` (the total number of vertices), `x` (the number of chosen vertices), and `y` (a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n - x`). It also receives a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
