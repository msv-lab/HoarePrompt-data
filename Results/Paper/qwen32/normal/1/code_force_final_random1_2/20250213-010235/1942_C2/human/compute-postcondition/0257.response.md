Output State: **`odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, containing at least one element; `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even; the current value of `y` is 0; `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `2 * y`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is set to 0, while the values of `odd`, `even`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Since `y` was previously less than `gap // 2`, setting `y` to 0 maintains this condition. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `2 * y`, which is `2 * 0 = 0`, so `ans` remains unchanged from its previous value.
