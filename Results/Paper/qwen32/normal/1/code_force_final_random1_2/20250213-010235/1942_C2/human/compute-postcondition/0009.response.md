The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given that the initial value of `ans` is `x + y - 2`, after the increment, the new value of `ans` becomes `x + y - 1`.

All other variables (`tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements; the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` is exactly 2; `ans` is `x + y - 1`; `tmp` is an empty list.**
