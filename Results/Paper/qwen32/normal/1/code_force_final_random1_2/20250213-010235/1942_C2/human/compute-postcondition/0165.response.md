Output State: **`ans` is `(x - 2) + count + gap_current + 2 * (y - gap_current // 2)`, `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1 and must contain at least two elements, `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0, `y` is 0, `gap` is the next element in `odd` after `gap_current`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
