Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input, with `y` potentially adjusted; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the condition `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is true; `tmp` contains all the half-differences that met the even difference and `y` condition, plus the new element `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` if the condition is true; `ii` is incremented by 1; the sum of `a[0]`, `n`, and the negative of `a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2; if the condition is true, `y` is now `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`**
