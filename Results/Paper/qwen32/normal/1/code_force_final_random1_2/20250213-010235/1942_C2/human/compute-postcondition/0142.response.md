The code snippet `sx += y * 2` modifies the value of `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. The other variables (`val`, `i`, `y`, `c`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and conditions.

Given the initial state:
- `val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order.
- `i` is `i_next`.
- `y` is decreased by `c` (where `c` was `i_current // 2`).
- `c` is `i_next // 2`.
- `sx` is recalculated based on the new values of `y` and `c`.

After executing `sx += y * 2`, the only change is in the value of `sx`.

Output State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_next`; `y` is decreased by `c` (where `c` was `i_current // 2`); `c` is `i_next // 2`; `sx` is recalculated based on the new values of `y` and `c` and then increased by `y * 2`.**
