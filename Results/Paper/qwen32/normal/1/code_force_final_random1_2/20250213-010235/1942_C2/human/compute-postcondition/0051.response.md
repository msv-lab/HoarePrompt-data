The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`; `ans` is `x + y - 1`; `ii` is incremented by 1; `tmp` is an empty list.**
