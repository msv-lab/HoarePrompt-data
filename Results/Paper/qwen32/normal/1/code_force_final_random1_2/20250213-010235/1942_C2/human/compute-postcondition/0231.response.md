The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Since `gap` is specified to be greater than 1 and odd, and `odd` was initially an empty list, after executing the code, `odd` will contain one element, which is the value of `gap`.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `odd` is a list containing `gap`, `even` is an empty list, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1` and is greater than 1 and odd.**
