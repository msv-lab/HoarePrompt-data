The code snippet sorts the list `a`. This means that the order of elements in `a` is rearranged such that they are in ascending order. The values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `ii` is incremented by 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**
