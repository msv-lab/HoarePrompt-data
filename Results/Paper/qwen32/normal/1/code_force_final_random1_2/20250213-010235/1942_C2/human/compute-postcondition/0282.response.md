Postcondition: **`ans` is the sum of all elements in `odd` plus `2 * y` if `y` is less than `gap // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the sum of all elements in `odd`. `y` is `0` if `y` was less than `gap // 2`. Otherwise, `y` retains its original value minus the sum of `gap // 2` for all `gap` in `odd`. `even` is a list with at least one element in both cases.**
