The given code snippet modifies the value of `cons` by taking the minimum between `n - 2` and its current value. This means that if `n - 2` is less than the current value of `cons`, `cons` will be updated to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `cons` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by the code is `cons`.

Output State: **`val` remains sorted with all even numbers before odd numbers; `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` plus the original count of `1`s in `val`; `i` is the last element of `val`; `y` is reduced by the sum of `i // 2` for all elements in `val`; `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`**.
