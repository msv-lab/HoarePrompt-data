The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement, which means it will exit the nearest enclosing loop (such as a `for` or `while` loop). This does not affect the values of the variables `val`, `i`, `c`, or `sx`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_new`; `c` is `i_new // 2`; `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`.**
