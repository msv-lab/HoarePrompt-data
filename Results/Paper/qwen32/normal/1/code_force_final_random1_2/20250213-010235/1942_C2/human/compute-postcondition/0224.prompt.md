Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is `x - 2`, `y` is `0` if `y` dropped below `gap // 2` for any processed `gap`, otherwise `y` is the remaining value after all possible subtractions, `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1, `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input where each integer is decreased by 1, `st` is a set of unique elements from `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
    t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
    if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is `x - 1` if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x - 2`. `y` is `0` if `y` dropped below `gap // 2` for any processed `gap`, otherwise `y` is the remaining value after all possible subtractions. `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1, `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input where each integer is decreased by 1, `st` is a set of unique elements from `a`, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, and `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is `x` if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`; otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2`. `y` is `0` if `y` dropped below `gap // 2` for any processed `gap`, otherwise `y` is the remaining value after all possible subtractions. `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1, `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input where each integer is decreased by 1, `st` is a set of unique elements from `a`, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is `x + 1` if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`; otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2`. `y` is `0` if `y` dropped below `gap // 2` for any processed `gap`, otherwise `y` is the remaining value after all possible subtractions. `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1, `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input where each integer is decreased by 1, `st` is a set of unique elements from `a`, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
