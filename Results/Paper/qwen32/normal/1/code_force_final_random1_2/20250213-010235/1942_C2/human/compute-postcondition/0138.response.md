The code snippet `sx += i` increments the value of `sx` by the value of `i`. 

Given the initial state, `sx` is already defined based on the conditions involving `y`, `c`, and the count of `1`s in `val`. The only change here is the addition of `i` to `sx`.

Therefore, the updated value of `sx` will be its original value plus `i`.

Output State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order. If `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is the original count of `1`s in `val` plus `y * 2` plus `i`. If `y` is not less than `c`, `sx` is the original count of `1`s in `val` plus `i`. `c` is `i // 2`.**
