Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the total reduction in health is equal to the initial value of `k` or until all monsters are processed; `x`, `k` must be greater than 0; `n`, and `sorted_indices` must have at least one element; `distance` is now 2; if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged; `rest` must be greater than 0; `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]; `rest` is now `rest - delta`; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented by 1.**
