Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the total reduction in health is equal to the initial value of `k` or until all monsters are processed; `x`, `k` must be greater than 0; `n`, and `sorted_indices` must have at least one element; `distance` is now 2; `pos` is 0; `rest` is equal to `k - delta`; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.**

Explanation: The value of `rest` is decreased by `delta`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
