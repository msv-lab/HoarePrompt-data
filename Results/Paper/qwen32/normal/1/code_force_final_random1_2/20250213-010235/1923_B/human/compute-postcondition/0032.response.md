Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where some values may be reduced to 0, `x` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `sorted_indices` is unchanged, `distance` is 1, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, and `rest` is 0. If the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals `distance`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return and continues execution.**
