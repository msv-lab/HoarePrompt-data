Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, `n` is the length of the list `a` (and `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while pos != len(sorted_indices):
    if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
        return False
    rest = k
    while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
        delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
        rest -= delta
        a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
        if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
            pos += 1
    distance += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where some values may be reduced to 0, `x` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `sorted_indices` is unchanged, `distance` is 1, `pos` is either the length of `sorted_indices` or the index of the next monster to process, and `rest` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the total reduction in health is equal to the initial value of `k` or until all monsters are processed. `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `distance` is now 2. `pos` is either the length of `sorted_indices` or the position where `rest` became 0. `rest` is 0 if all `k` units were used up, otherwise it is a positive value indicating unused units.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters after applying the maximum possible reduction of `k`. `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `distance` is 3. `pos` is the index of the next unprocessed monster or equal to the length of `sorted_indices` if all monsters are processed. `rest` is 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
