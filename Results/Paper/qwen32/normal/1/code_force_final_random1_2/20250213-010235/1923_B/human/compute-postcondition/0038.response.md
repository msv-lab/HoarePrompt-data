Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the health of the monster at `sorted_indices[pos]` is now `0`; `x` is unchanged; `k` is greater than 0; `n` is unchanged; `sorted_indices` is unchanged; `distance` is 1; `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`; `rest` is `rest - delta`; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` (before the decrement) and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` (before the decrement). The current value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is `0`.**
