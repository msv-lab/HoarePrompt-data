Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the health of the monster at `sorted_indices[pos]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta` if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was originally not `0`. `x` is unchanged; `k` is greater than 0; `n` is unchanged; `sorted_indices` is unchanged; `distance` is 1; `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices` minus one and has been incremented by 1; `rest` is `rest - delta`; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `pos` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
