Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the total reduction in health is equal to the initial value of `k` or until all monsters are processed; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`; `x`, `k` must be greater than 0; `n`, and `sorted_indices` must have at least one element; `distance` is now 2; if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented to `pos + 1`; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged; `rest` must be greater than 0; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `rest` is decreased by `delta`.**
