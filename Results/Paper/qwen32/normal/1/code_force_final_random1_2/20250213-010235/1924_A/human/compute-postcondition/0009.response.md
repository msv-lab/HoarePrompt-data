Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0; `ans` is an empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. Additionally, the bitwise AND of `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` equals 0, indicating that the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set.**
