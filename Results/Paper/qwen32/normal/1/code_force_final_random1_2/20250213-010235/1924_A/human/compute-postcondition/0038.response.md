The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `tmp` as an empty string. This action does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`). The only change is the introduction of `tmp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input; `cnt` is the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence, and `cnt` is less than `n`; `cur` is 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence; `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters; `tmp` is an empty string.**
