The code assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)` to `tmp`. Given that `i` is 5, `tmp` will be `chr(ord('a') + 5)`, which is `'f'`. Since the 5th bit of `cur` was 0 (as per the condition), the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 5; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete set; `ans` is the string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters; `cnt` is less than `n`; `i` is 5; `tmp` is 'f' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
