The code assigns `tmp` the value of the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `k`, `tmp` will hold a character starting from `'b'` (if `i` was initially 0) up to the character corresponding to `ord('a') + (k-1)`.

Given that `cnt` is less than `n` and `k` is greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `tmp`.

Output State: **`cnt` is less than `n`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `k`, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + i)`**.
