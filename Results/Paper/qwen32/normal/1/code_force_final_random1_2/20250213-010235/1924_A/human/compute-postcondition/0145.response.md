Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is the integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet; if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is unchanged, and `ans` is a string that includes the character `ss` appended to it. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
