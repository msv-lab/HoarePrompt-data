Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 5; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete set; `ans` is the string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters; `cnt` is less than `n`; `i` is 5. If the 5th bit of `cur` was 0, `tmp` is 'f' and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.**
