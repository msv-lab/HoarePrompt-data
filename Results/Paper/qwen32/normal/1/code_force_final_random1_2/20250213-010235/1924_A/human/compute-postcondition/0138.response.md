The only variable in the loop head is `ss`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `ss` is the current character being processed. To move to the next iteration, `ss` should be updated to the next character in the string `s`.

Let's denote the current character as `s[j]`. After processing `s[j]`, the next character to be processed would be `s[j+1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[j+1]) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss` was 0, then the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1, making `cur` equal to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1` after this operation, then `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` is set to `s[j+1]`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.**

However, since we are only adjusting the state of `ss` and not the indices or other variables directly related to the iteration, we can simply say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**
