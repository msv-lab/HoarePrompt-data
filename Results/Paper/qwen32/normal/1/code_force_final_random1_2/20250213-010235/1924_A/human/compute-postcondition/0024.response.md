Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet; `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` if `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is a string containing the character `ss`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.**
