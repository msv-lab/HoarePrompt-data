The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the variable `ans`. The value of `tmp` is determined by the condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` within the range `[0, k-1]`. If such an `i` exists, `tmp` is set to the character `'a' + i`; otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.

Since `tmp` is either an empty string or a specific character based on the condition, appending `tmp` to `ans` will either leave `ans` unchanged (if `tmp` is an empty string) or add the specific character to `ans`.

Given the initial state, the output state will reflect the updated value of `ans` after the concatenation. The other variables (`cur`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified in the code snippet, which they are not.

Output State: **`tmp` is set to the character `'a' + i` where `i` is the smallest index such that `cur & 1 << i == 0`, or `tmp` remains an empty string if no such `i` exists within the range `[0, k-1]`; `ans` is updated to `ans + tmp`.**
