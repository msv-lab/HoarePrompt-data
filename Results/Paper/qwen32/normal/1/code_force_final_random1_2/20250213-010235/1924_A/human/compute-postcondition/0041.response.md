The given code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp`. Specifically, `tmp` is set to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the integer `i`.

Given that `i` is used in the expression `ord('a') + i`, and assuming `i` is within the range 0 to 25 (since there are 26 lowercase English letters), `tmp` will be one of the lowercase English letters.

Here's the updated state of the variables after executing the code:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, `m` remain the integers read from the input.
- `s` remains the string read from the input.
- `cnt` remains the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence, and `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `cur` remains 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence.
- `ans` remains a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters.
- `tmp` is now the character `'a' + i`, which means if `i` was 0, `tmp` is `'a'`; if `i` was 1, `tmp` is `'b'`, and so on up to `'z'` if `i` was 25.
- The condition `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` remains true as per the problem statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is the string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence, `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters, `tmp` is the character `'a' + i`, and the condition `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` is true.**
