Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1.**
