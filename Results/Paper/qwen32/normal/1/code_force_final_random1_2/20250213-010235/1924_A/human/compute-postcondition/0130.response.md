The only variable in the loop head is `ss`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ss` was the last character processed from the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ss` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `s`.

Let's denote the current character in the string as `s[i]`. After processing `s[i]`, the next character to be processed would be `s[i+1]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `ss` is `s[i]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[i+1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[i+1]) - ord('a')`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1.**
