The code calculates the ASCII value of the character `ss` and subtracts the ASCII value of 'a' from it, storing the result in `cur_ss`. This operation effectively converts the character `ss` into its corresponding position in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z').

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `cur_ss`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `ss` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is the integer value representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z').**
