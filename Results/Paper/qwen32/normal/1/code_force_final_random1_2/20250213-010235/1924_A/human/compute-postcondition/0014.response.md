Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is 1; `ans` is an empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is explicitly set to 0 in the given code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values as no other operations affect them.
