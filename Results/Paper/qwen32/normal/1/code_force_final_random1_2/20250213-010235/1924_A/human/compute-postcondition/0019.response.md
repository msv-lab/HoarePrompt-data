The given code snippet modifies the value of `cur` by performing a bitwise left shift operation on `1` by the amount specified by `cur_ss` and then adding the result to `cur`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `cur`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

The new value of `cur` is calculated as `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, which means `cur` is updated to its current value plus `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is an empty string; `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**.
