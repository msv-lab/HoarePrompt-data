Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is the string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence, `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters, `tmp` is `'a' + i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
