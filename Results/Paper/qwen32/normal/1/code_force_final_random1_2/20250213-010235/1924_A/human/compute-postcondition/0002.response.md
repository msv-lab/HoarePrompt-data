The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. This means the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**

In natural language, this means that the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are now whatever integers were provided in the input, while `t` and `s` retain their original values and constraints.
