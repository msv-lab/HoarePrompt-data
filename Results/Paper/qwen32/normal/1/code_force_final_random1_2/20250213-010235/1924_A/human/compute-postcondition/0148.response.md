The initial state tells us that `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, but this information does not affect the execution of the `print` statement since the statement only outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.
- The condition `cnt >= n` does not influence the content of the string being printed.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
