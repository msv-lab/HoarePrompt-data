The given code snippet initializes a new variable `tmp` as an empty string. This action does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`). The only change is the introduction of `tmp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete set; `ans` is the string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters; `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is an empty string.**
