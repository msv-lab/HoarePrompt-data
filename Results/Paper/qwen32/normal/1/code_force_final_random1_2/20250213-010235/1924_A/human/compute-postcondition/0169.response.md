Postcondition: **`cnt` and `n` are integers. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program does nothing further regarding `tmp` and `ans`. Otherwise, `tmp` is set to the character `'a' + i` where `i` is the smallest index such that `cur & 1 << i == 0`, or `tmp` remains an empty string if no such `i` exists within the range `[0, k-1]`. Additionally, `ans` is updated to `ans + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` if `tmp` is not set to an empty string.**
