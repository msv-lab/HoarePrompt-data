Given the initial state, we have several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`) with specific roles and conditions described. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the other variables. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly specified and does not depend on any of the other variables.

Output: **NO**
