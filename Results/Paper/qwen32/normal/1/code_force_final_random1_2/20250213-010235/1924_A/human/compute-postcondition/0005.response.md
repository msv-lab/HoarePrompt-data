Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is initialized to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`) retain their initial values.
