Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is an empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was initially unset, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss`, setting the bit at position `cur_ss` to 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. Currently, `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, indicating all bits from 0 to `k-1` are set to 1.**
