Given the initial state, there is no information provided about the variable `nx`. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact value of `nx` based solely on the information given.

However, if we assume that `nx` is defined somewhere in the code that is not shown here, the output would simply be the value of `nx`.

Since the exact value of `nx` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `nx`.

Output: **nx (where nx is the value of the variable nx)**
