The code snippet `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`. Given that `sb` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `sb` will contain one element, which is the value of `i`.

Since the values of `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `n` are not modified by the given code snippet, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'F's involving scenario `j-1`; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'S's involving scenario `j-1`; `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, the first being an empty string and the next `n` being the input strings; `sa` is an empty list; `sb` is a list containing the single element `i`; `n` must be at least 1. Additionally, `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.**
