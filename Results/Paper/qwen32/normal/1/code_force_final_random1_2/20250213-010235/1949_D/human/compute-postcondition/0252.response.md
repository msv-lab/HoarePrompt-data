The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the existing value of the variable `nx`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1; `nx` has 'S' appended to its original value.**
