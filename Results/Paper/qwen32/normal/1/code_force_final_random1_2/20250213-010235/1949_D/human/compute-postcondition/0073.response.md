Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24
- `a` is a list of integers with length `n+1`
- `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1`
- `xx` is a list containing three elements: an empty string, the string `x`, and the string `x`
- `x` is the newly input string
- `j` is 1

Code Snippet:
```python
a[i] += 1
```

From the code snippet, we see that the element at index `i` in the list `a` is incremented by 1. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given initial state. Assuming `i` is intended to be `j` (as `j` is the only other integer variable mentioned), the element at index `j` (which is 1) in the list `a` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the element at index 1 in the list `a` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24; `a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where the element at index 1 is incremented by 1; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1`; `xx` is a list containing three elements: an empty string, the string `x`, and the string `x`; `x` is the newly input string; `j` is 1**.

In natural language: The value at index 1 of the list `a` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
