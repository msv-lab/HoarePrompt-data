The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. This means that whatever the previous value of `nx` was, it now has 'S' added to its end.

Given the initial state, all other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged. Only `nx` is modified.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `n + 1`; `nx` has 'S' appended to its previous value.**
