Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24; `a` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `j` is the count of 'F's at position `j-1` in `x`; `b` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `j` is the count of 'S's at position `j-1` in `x`; `xx` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being the string `x`; `x` is a string read from the input.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `xx` now contains two elements: the first element is an empty string, and the second element is the string `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
