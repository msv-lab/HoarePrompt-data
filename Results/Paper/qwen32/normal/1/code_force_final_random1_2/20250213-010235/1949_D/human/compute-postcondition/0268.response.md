The code snippet appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `nx` will contain the single character `xx[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `nx` is `xx[i][j - 1]`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**.
