Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1, `b` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `i` is incremented by 1 and, if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', the element at index `j` (which is 4) is incremented by an additional 1, `xx` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being the string `x`, `x` is a string read from the input, `j` is 4.**
