### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a significant flaw in the provided code. The core issue is that the current algorithm does not ensure that no matter the order of scenarios, the player will never see more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. The strategy used in the code to assign 'F' and 'S' to '?' positions is simplistic and does not take into account the global constraint on consecutive videos of the same type across all permutations of scenarios.

Let's break down the issues using the examples provided in the original assessment:

#### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
????.
```

**Possible Output:**
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFS.F
FFFF.
```

**Permutation 1 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5):**
- Transitions: 1 -> 3 (F), 3 -> 4 (S), 4 -> 5 (F)
- Consecutive 'F': 1

**Permutation 2 (1, 2, 5, 4, 3):**
- Transitions: 1 -> 3 (F), 3 -> 5 (F), 5 -> 4 (F), 4 -> 3 (S)
- Consecutive 'F': 3

While the above example does not exceed the limit of \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\), it demonstrates that the code does not guarantee the constraint for all permutations.

#### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
6
.?F???
?.??S?
F?.???
??S.??
??????
?????.
```

**Possible Output:**
```
.FFFF.
F.FSS.
FF.SS.
FFS.S.
FFFFF.
FFFFF.
```

**Permutation 1 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6):**
- Transitions: 1 -> 3 (F), 3 -> 4 (S), 4 -> 5 (F), 5 -> 6 (F)
- Consecutive 'F': 2

**Permutation 2 (1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3):**
- Transitions: 1 -> 3 (F), 3 -> 6 (F), 6 -> 5 (F), 5 -> 4 (F), 4 -> 3 (S)
- Consecutive 'F': 4

In this case, the output violates the constraint because it allows four consecutive 'F' videos, which exceeds the limit of \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 6}{4} \rceil = 5\).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not guarantee that the constraint on consecutive videos of the same type is met for all permutations of scenarios. The logic used to assign 'F' and 'S' to '?' positions is flawed and does not consider the global constraint effectively.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
