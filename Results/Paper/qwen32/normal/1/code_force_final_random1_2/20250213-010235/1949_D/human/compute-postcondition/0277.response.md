The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` increments the variable `nx` by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is `k+1` and `j` is `n + 1`, the value added to `nx` is `xx[k+1][n]`.

Since the initial state specifies that `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged except for `i` being `k+1` and `j` being `n + 1`, the only change in the output state is the updated value of `nx`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `n + 1`; `nx` is increased by `xx[k+1][n]`.**
