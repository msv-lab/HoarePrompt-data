The value of `nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is `k+1` and `j` is `1`, the value added to `nx` is `xx[k+1][0]`.

All other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1; `nx` is increased by `xx[k+1][0]`.**
