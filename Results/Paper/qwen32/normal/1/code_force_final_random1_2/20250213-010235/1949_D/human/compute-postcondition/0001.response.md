Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, where each line contains n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is 'F' if the transition video between scenarios i and j is funny, 'S' if it is scary, '?' if it is undecided, or '.' if i = j. It is guaranteed that the input matrix is symmetric (i.e., the j-th character of the i-th line is the same as the i-th character of the j-th line), and there are at most floor(n/2) 'F' or 'S' characters in the input. `a` is a list of integers with length n+1, initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is now a list of length `n+1` with all elements initialized to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
