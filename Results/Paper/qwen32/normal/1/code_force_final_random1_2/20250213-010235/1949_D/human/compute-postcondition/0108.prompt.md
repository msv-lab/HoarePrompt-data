Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'F's involving scenario `j-1`; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'S's involving scenario `j-1`; `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, the first being an empty string and the next `n` being the input strings; `sa` is an empty list; `sb` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)
    if b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'F's involving scenario `j-1`; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'S's involving scenario `j-1`; `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, the first being an empty string and the next `n` being the input strings; `sa` is an empty list; `sb` is a list containing the single element `i` if `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, otherwise `sb` remains an empty list; `n` must be at least 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'F's involving scenario `j-1`; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'S's involving scenario `j-1`; `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, the first being an empty string and the next `n` being the input strings; if `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sa` is a list containing the single element `i`, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list; `sb` is a list containing the single element `i` if `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, otherwise `sb` remains an empty list. If `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `sb` includes `i` as its last element; `n` must be at least 1; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'F's involving scenario `j-1`; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'S's involving scenario `j-1`; `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, the first being an empty string and the next `n` being the input strings; if `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sa` is a list containing the elements from its initial state plus `i`; otherwise, `sa` remains unchanged; `sb` is a list containing its initial elements plus `i` if `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`; `n` must be at least 1; `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
