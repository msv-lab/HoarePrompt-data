Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is incremented by 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` has its previous value with 'S' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` has 'F' appended to its original value.**
