Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by `xx[k+1][0]`. Otherwise, `nx` has 'S' appended to its original value if `i` is in `sb[:n // 4]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4]`. Otherwise, `nx` has 'F' appended to its original value.**
