Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `nx` is `'F'`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`; `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4]`.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` was initially an empty string and now it contains the character `'F'`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
