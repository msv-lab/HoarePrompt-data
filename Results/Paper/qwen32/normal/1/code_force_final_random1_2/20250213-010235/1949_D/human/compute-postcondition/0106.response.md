The code snippet `sb.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `sb`. This means that `sb` will now include `i` as an additional element at the end of the list.

Given the initial state, `sb` is defined as a list containing the single element `i` if `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, otherwise `sb` remains unchanged. After executing the code snippet, `sb` will definitely include `i` as an additional element, regardless of its previous state.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `n`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'F's involving scenario `j-1`; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'S's involving scenario `j-1`; `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, the first being an empty string and the next `n` being the input strings; if `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sa` is a list containing the elements from its initial state plus `i`; otherwise, `sa` remains unchanged; `sb` is a list containing its initial elements plus `i`; `n` must be at least 1; `i` is `i + 1`.**
