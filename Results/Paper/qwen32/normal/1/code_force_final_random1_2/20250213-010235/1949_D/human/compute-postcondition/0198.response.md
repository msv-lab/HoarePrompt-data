To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `i` is set to 6.
- `n` is the same as the input value.
- `nx` is a string constructed by appending characters from `xx[6][0]` to `xx[6][n-1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nx)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: It is explicitly set to 6.
2. **Variable `n`**: It is stated to be the same as the input value. However, since no specific input value is provided, we'll denote it as `n`.
3. **String `nx`**: This string is constructed by taking characters from the 7th row (`xx[6]`) of a 2D list `xx`, starting from the 0th index up to the `(n-1)`th index.

Since the exact contents of the 2D list `xx` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact characters that will be included in `nx`. However, we can describe the construction of `nx` precisely based on the given information.

### Construction of `nx`:
- `nx` is constructed by slicing the 7th row of the 2D list `xx` from the start (index 0) to the end (index `n-1`).
- Therefore, `nx` will be `xx[6][0:n]`.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific details about the 2D list `xx`, we can only describe `nx` in terms of its construction. The string `nx` will contain the substring of `xx[6]` from index 0 to `n-1`.

Thus, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **nx (where nx is the substring of xx[6] from index 0 to n-1)**
