#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, where each line contains n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is 'F' if the transition video between scenarios i and j is funny, 'S' if it is scary, '?' if it is undecided, or '.' if i = j. It is guaranteed that the input matrix is symmetric (i.e., the j-th character of the i-th line is the same as the i-th character of the j-th line), and there are at most floor(n/2) 'F' or 'S' characters in the input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a symmetric `n x n` matrix where each element is 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', representing the type of transition video between scenarios. It processes this matrix to replace '?' with either 'F' or 'S' based on certain conditions related to the counts of 'F' and 'S' in each row. The function then prints the modified matrix.
