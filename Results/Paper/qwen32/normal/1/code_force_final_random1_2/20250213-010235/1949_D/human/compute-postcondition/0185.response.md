To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `j`. The variable `n` is also relevant as it defines the range of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 6, and `n` is greater than or equal to 6.
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n`.

Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` would be `k + 1`.

However, since the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize that if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` would be `k + 1`. Given that the loop starts with `j = 1` and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, if the previous iteration ended with `j = k`, the next iteration will start with `j = k + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that `j` was at some value that allows the loop to continue. If `j` was 6 at the end of the previous iteration (the highest possible value before the loop might terminate), then the loop would terminate. Therefore, `j` must have been less than 6 at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume `j` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `j` would be 6.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6**

However, to be general and correct without assuming specific values, we can say:
State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration**

But since we need a concrete example, let's assume `j` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6**

If we want to be precise and general:
State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `j` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**

For a concrete example:
State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6**

This ensures the loop continues correctly based on the provided information.
