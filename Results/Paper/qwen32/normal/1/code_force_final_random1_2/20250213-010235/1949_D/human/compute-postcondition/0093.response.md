The code appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. Since `sa` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `sa` will contain one element, which is the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'F's involving scenario `j-1`; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'S's involving scenario `j-1`; `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, the first being an empty string and the next `n` being the input strings; `sa` is a list containing the single element `i`; `sb` is an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; the current value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0.**
