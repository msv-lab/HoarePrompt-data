The code appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'F's involving scenario `j-1`; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'S's involving scenario `j-1`; `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, the first being an empty string and the next `n` being the input strings; `sa` is a list containing the single element `i`; `sb` is a list containing the single element `i` if `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, otherwise `sb` remains an empty list; `n` must be at least 1; `i` is `i + 1`.**
