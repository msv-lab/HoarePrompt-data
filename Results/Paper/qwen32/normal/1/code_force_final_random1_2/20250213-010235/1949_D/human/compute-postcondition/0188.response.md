The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `nx`, we assume it is a string (possibly empty). After appending 'S', the value of `nx` changes accordingly. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6, `nx` is a string with 'S' appended to its previous value.**
