The code snippet appends the character at position `j - 1` from the string `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `nx` will contain the character at the specified position.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `nx` is the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` is not '?'**
