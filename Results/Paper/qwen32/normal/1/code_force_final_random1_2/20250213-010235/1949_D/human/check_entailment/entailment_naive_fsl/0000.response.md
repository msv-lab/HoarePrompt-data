Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not guarantee that no matter the order of scenarios, the player will never see more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. The logic used to assign 'F' and 'S' to '?' positions is flawed and does not consider the constraint on consecutive videos of the same type.

Here's a specific counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
????.
```

The code might output something like:
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFS.F
FFFF.
```

However, let's consider the permutation of scenarios 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The transitions would be:
1 -> 3 (F)
3 -> 4 (S)
4 -> 5 (F)

Now, let's consider another permutation, say 1, 2, 5, 4, 3:
1 -> 3 (F)
3 -> 5 (F)
5 -> 4 (F)
4 -> 3 (S)

In this case, we see three consecutive 'F' videos (1 -> 3, 3 -> 5, 5 -> 4), which is within the limit of \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\). However, the code does not ensure this for all possible permutations.

A more problematic case could be:
```
6
.?F???
?.??S?
F?.???
??S.??
??????
?????.
```

The code might output something like:
```
.FFFF.
F.FSS.
FF.SS.
FFS.S.
FFFFF.
FFFFF.
```

For the permutation 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the transitions would be:
1 -> 3 (F)
3 -> 4 (S)
4 -> 5 (F)
5 -> 6 (F)

But for the permutation 1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3:
1 -> 3 (F)
3 -> 6 (F)
6 -> 5 (F)
5 -> 4 (F)
4 -> 3 (S)

Here, we see four consecutive 'F' videos (1 -> 3, 3 -> 6, 6 -> 5, 5 -> 4), which exceeds the limit of \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 6}{4} \rceil = 5\).

Thus, the code does not handle all cases correctly and fails to meet the problem's requirements.
