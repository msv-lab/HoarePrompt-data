The code appends the character at position `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, after the operation, `nx` will contain the character at `xx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition that `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?' remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `nx` is the character at `xx[6][j - 1]`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**
