The code snippet assigns an empty string to the variable `nx`. This means that the value of `nx` changes from being a string of length `n` to an empty string. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `nx` is an empty string; `i` is incremented by 1.**
