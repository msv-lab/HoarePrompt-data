The given code snippet appends 'F' to the variable `nx`. This operation does not depend on any conditions or the values of other variables, so `nx` will simply have 'F' added to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is now `j + 1`; `nx` has 'F' appended to its original value.**
