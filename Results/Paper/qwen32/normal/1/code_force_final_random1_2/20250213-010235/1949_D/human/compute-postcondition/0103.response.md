The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented again to the next value it should take in the sequence.

Given that `i` is currently `i + 1` from the previous iteration, the next value for `i` should be `i + 2` (since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

However, since we are setting up the state at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be set to the value it will take at the beginning of that iteration, which is simply `i + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'F's involving scenario `j-1`; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'S's involving scenario `j-1`; `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, the first being an empty string and the next `n` being the input strings; if `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sa` is a list containing the single element `i`, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list; `sb` is a list containing the single element `i` if `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, otherwise `sb` remains an empty list. If `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `sb` includes `i` as its last element; `n` must be at least 1; `i` is `i + 1`.**
