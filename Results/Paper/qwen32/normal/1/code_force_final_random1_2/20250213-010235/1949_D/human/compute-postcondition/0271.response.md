The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `nx` will be 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `nx` is 'S'; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`. Additionally, either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.**
