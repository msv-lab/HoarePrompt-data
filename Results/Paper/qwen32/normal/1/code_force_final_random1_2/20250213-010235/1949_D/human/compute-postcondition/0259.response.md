The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `nx`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1; `nx` has 'F' appended to it.**
