The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was some value between 1 and `n` inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `j` was at its maximum value (`n`) at the end of the previous iteration, the loop cannot execute another iteration because `j` would exceed `n` if incremented.

However, if we consider the scenario where `j` is not yet at its maximum value, then `j` should be incremented by 1.

Since the problem specifies that we need to adjust the state for the start of the next iteration, we assume `j` is not yet at `n`. Therefore, we increment `j` by 1.

State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is incremented by 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, then `nx` is `'' + xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, then `nx` is `'S'` if either `i` or `j` (or both) is in the first quarter of `sb` (i.e., `i in sb[:n // 4]` or `j in sb[:n // 4]`); otherwise, `nx` is `'F'`.**

To be more precise, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration other than it being between 1 and `n`, we can generalize that `j` is incremented by 1:

State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is incremented by 1.**
