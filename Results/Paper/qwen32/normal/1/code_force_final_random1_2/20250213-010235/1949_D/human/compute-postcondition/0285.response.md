The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing value of the variable `nx`. This means that whatever `nx` was before, it now has 'F' added to its end.

Given the initial state, the variables `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Only `nx` is modified.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1; `nx` has 'F' appended to its original value.**
