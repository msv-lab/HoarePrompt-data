The code snippet `rev_array = array[::-1]` creates a new list `rev_array` which is the reverse of the existing list `array`. This operation does not affect the original `array`, `n`, `l`, or `alp`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `l` is an input integer
- `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `alp` is a predefined list of lowercase English alphabets

After executing the code, the only change is the creation of `rev_array` which is the reversed version of `array`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `l` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.**
