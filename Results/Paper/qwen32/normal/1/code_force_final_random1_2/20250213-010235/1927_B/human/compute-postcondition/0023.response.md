The given code appends another element to the list `ans`. This element is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in the slice `rev_array[j:]`, subtracting 1 from this count, and using the resulting index to access an element from the list `alp`.

Given the initial state, `ans` already contains one element which is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`. After executing the code snippet, `ans` will now contain two elements, both derived from the same logic.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing two elements, each being `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `l` must be greater than 0; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `j` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, `ans` now has two identical elements, `i` and `j` have each been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.
