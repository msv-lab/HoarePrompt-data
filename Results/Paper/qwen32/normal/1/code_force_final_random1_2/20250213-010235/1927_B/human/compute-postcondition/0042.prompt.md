Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm',
        'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
    rev_array = array[::-1]
    ans = []
    for j in range(l):
        ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
    print(''.join(map(str, ans)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is a list of `l` characters, where each character is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus one, mapped to a character in `alp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, each being `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for `j` from `0` to `l-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is a list containing `l` characters from the `alp` list, where each character is determined by the count of the corresponding element in the reversed `array` slice minus one. `i` is incremented by 1, `array` remains unchanged, `alp` remains unchanged, and `rev_array` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
