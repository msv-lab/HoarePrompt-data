The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list. This means that the previous contents of `ans` (which was a list containing `l` elements) are discarded and `ans` now holds an empty list. The other variables (`i`, `array`, `alp`, and `rev_array`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is an empty list; `i` is incremented by 1; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `alp` is a list of the English alphabet characters; `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.**
