To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it modifies the `ans` list based on the given inputs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. The loop runs `l` times, where `l` is the input integer.
2. In each iteration, `j` ranges from `0` to `l-1`.
3. For each `j`, the code calculates `rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1`. This expression counts the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist starting from index `j` to the end of `rev_array`, then subtracts 1.
4. The result of the above calculation is used as an index to access an element in the `alp` list, which is then appended to the `ans` list.

Given that the loop runs `l` times and appends an element to `ans` in each iteration, the final state of `ans` will be a list with `l` elements.

Let's formalize this:

- `ans` will be a list of length `l`, where each element is determined by the expression `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for `j` ranging from `0` to `l-1`.
- All other variables (`i`, `l`, `array`, `alp`, `rev_array`) remain unchanged in their structure and content as per the initial state, except for `i` which is incremented by 1 (but this detail is not relevant to the final state of `ans`).

Therefore, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `l` elements, each being `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for `j` from `0` to `l-1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `ans` will contain `l` elements, where each element corresponds to the calculated character from the `alp` list based on the count of elements in the reversed array `rev_array`.
