The given code snippet appends a character from the `alp` list to the `ans` list based on the count of a specific element in the `rev_array`. Let's break down the changes:

- `ans` initially is an empty list.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `alp` is a list of the English alphabet characters.
- `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
- `l` must be greater than 0.

The line of code provided is:
```python
ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
```

This line does the following:
- It counts the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist starting from index `j` to the end of `rev_array`.
- It subtracts 1 from this count.
- It uses this result as an index to get a character from the `alp` list.
- It appends this character to the `ans` list.

Since the exact value of `j` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact character appended to `ans`. However, we know that `ans` will now contain one more element, which is a character from the `alp` list.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing one additional character from the `alp` list, `i` is incremented by 1, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `alp` is a list of the English alphabet characters, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `l` must be greater than 0.**
