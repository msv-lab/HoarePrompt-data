The given code appends a new character to the list `ans`. This character is determined by finding the count of the current element `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]`, subtracting one from this count, and using the resulting index to select a character from the list `alp`.

Given the initial state, let's break down the changes:

- `n` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `l` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `array` remains the same list of integers.
- `alp` remains the same list of characters.
- `rev_array` remains the reversed version of `array`.
- `ans` now contains one more character, which is the character from `alp` corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus one.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `l` is greater than or equal to 1; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`; `ans` is a list containing one more character than before, specifically the character from `alp` corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus one; `j` is `j + 1`**.
