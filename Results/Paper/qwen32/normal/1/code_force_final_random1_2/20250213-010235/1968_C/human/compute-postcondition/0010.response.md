The given code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` where `i` is 5. According to the initial state, `a[i]` for `i > 0` is defined as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. Since `i` is 5, `a[5]` will be updated to `a[4] + x[4]`.

Given that `a[4]` is already calculated as `a[3] + x[3]`, the new value of `a[5]` will be `(a[3] + x[3]) + x[4]`.

Thus, the only change is the value of `a[5]` which is now `a[4] + x[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, `a[3]` is `a[2] + x[2]`, `a[4]` is `a[3] + x[3]`, and `a[5]` is `a[4] + x[4]`, `i` is 5**
