To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not directly affect the content of the list `a` in this specific print statement.
- `n` is an input integer. This variable indicates the length of the list `x`.
- `x` is a list of integers with length `n`. These integers are used to populate the list `a` starting from the second element.
- `a` is a list where:
  - `a[0]` is explicitly set to 1000.
  - For `i > 0`, `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

### Calculation of List `a`:
1. Initialize `a[0]` to 1000.
2. For each subsequent element in `a` (from index 1 to `n-1`), compute `a[i]` using the formula `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate how `a` is constructed:
- Suppose `n = 3` and `x = [10, 20, 30]`.
- Initialize `a[0]` to 1000.
- Compute `a[1]` as `a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`.
- Compute `a[2]` as `a[1] + x[1] = 1010 + 20 = 1030`.
- Compute `a[3]` as `a[2] + x[2] = 1030 + 30 = 1060`.
- Thus, `a` becomes `[1000, 1010, 1030, 1060]`.

### Print Statement:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Given the above steps and the construction of the list `a`, the output will be the elements of `a` starting from 1000 and each subsequent element being the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `x`.

Output: **1000 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in x starting from 1000** (where each element in `a` after the first is calculated as `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`).
