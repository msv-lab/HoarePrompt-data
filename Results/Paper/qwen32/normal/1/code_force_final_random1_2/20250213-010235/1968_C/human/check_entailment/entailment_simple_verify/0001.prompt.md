You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem requirements step by step.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need to generate an array `a` such that `a[i] % a[i-1] == x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`.
2. The values of `a` must be within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `x` of size `n-1`.
3. It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros.
4. It sets the first element of `a` to 1000.
5. It iterates from the second element to the last element of `a`, setting `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
6. It prints the array `a`.

### Checking the Conditions:
1. **Initial Value**: The first element `a[0]` is set to 1000, which is within the range `[1, 10^9]`.
2. **Subsequent Values**: For `i >= 1`, `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. Since `x[i-1]` is at most 500, and `a[0]` is 1000, the maximum possible value of `a[i]` would be `1000 + 500*(n-1)`. Given that `n` is at most 500, the maximum possible value of `a[i]` is `1000 + 500*499 = 249500`, which is well within the range `[1, 10^9]`.
3. **Modulo Condition**: The program does not explicitly check whether `a[i] % a[i-1] == x[i]`. Instead, it constructs `a[i]` directly as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This means that `a[i] % a[i-1]` will indeed be `x[i-1]` because `a[i]` is constructed in such a way that the remainder when `a[i]` is divided by `a[i-1]` is exactly `x[i-1]`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly constructs the array `a` such that `a[i] % a[i-1] == x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`, and all elements of `a` are within the required range `[1, 10^9]`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
