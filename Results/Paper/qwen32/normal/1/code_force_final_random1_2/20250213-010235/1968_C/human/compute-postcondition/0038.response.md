Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list where:
  - `a[0]` is 1000.
  - `a[i]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1]` for i > 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*a)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(*a)` statement unpacks the list `a` and prints each element separated by spaces.

#### Construction of List `a`:
- `a[0]` is explicitly set to 1000.
- For `i > 0`, `a[i]` is calculated as `1000 + sum(x[0:i])`.

Given the above rules, let's construct the list `a` step-by-step:

1. `a[0] = 1000`
2. `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`
3. `a[2] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
4. `a[3] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`
5. And so on...

### Example Calculation:
Suppose `n = 5` and `x = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.

- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
- `a[2] = 1000 + 10 + 20 = 1030`
- `a[3] = 1000 + 10 + 20 + 30 = 1060`
- `a[4] = 1000 + 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 = 1100`
- `a[5] = 1000 + 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 1150`

Thus, the list `a` would be `[1000, 1010, 1030, 1060, 1100, 1150]`.

### General Case:
For any given `n` and list `x` of length `n`, the list `a` will be constructed as described above.

### Output:
The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-1]** (where `x` is the list of integers obtained from the input)
