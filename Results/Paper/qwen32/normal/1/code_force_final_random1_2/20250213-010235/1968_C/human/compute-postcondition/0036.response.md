The given code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` where `i` is initially 3. The new value of `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, and `x[i - 1]` is `x[2]`.

Thus, `a[3]` becomes `a[2] + x[2]`, which is `(1000 + x[0] + x[1]) + x[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000, `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, and `a[3]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`, `i` is 3**.
