The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` for i > 0. The loop variable `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration.

Given that the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, if `i` was 1 at the start of the previous iteration and ended as 2, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3, and `n` must still be greater than the current value of `i` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` for i > 0, `i` is 2**
