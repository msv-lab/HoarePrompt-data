The code snippet provided only updates the value of `n` by reading an integer input. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is 1000 + sum(x[0] to x[i-1])**
