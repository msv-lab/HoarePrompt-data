The code snippet `a = [0] * n` changes the list `a` to be a new list of length `n` where each element is initialized to 0. This means the previous values of `a` are overwritten.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the input integer
- `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is 1000 + sum(x[0] to x[i-1])

After executing `a = [0] * n`, the list `a` is now a list of zeros with length `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n`**.
