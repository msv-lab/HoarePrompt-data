In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the function `range(int(input()))`. The state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, and `x`, but according to the instructions, we can only adjust the state of objects in the loop head.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. The loop head uses `range(int(input()))`, which means the loop will execute `t` times if `t` is obtained from the input.
2. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and its initial state doesn't need adjustment since it is reassigned in each iteration.

Given these points, the only thing we need to ensure is that the input value `t` (which determines the number of iterations) is correctly set up before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state before the loop should ensure that `t` is already read from the input and is within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and it is already read from the input**.
