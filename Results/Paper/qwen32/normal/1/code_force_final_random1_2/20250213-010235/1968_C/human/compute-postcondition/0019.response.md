The code updates the list `a` starting from index `i` by setting `a[i]` to the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`. Given the initial state, `a[0]` is 1000, and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is initially 0. After executing the line of code, `a[i]` will be updated to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.**
This means that each element of `a` starting from index 1 is now the cumulative sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.
