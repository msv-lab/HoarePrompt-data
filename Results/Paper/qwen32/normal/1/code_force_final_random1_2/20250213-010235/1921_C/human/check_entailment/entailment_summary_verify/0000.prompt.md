You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

- Program:
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[-1]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        array2 = []
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`) and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the differences between consecutive integers in the list and compares it to the threshold `f`. It prints "Yes" if the calculated value is less than `f`; otherwise, it prints "No".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.
- The phone starts with `f` units of charge.
- The phone loses `a` units of charge per unit of time.
- Turning the phone off and on consumes `b` units of charge.
- Determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the energy required to send messages based on the time intervals between messages and the cost of turning the phone on and off.

Here's the key part of the program:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Energy Consumption**:
   - The program calculates the energy needed to send messages during intervals where the phone is on (`array2`).
   - However, it does not account for the energy consumed by turning the phone on and off correctly.
   
2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:` checks if the interval is shorter than the energy cost of turning the phone on and off divided by the energy loss per unit time. This logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the energy consumption when the phone is turned on and off.
   - The program sums up the energy used during intervals where the phone is on but incorrectly adds the energy cost of turning the phone on and off for all messages, regardless of whether the phone was actually turned on and off.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not consider scenarios where the phone might need to be turned off and on multiple times within a single test case.
   - It does not correctly simulate the process of turning the phone on and off to ensure that the charge never drops below zero.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 10 1 2
1 3 5
```
- Initial charge `f = 10`, charge loss per unit time `a = 1`, energy cost of turning on/off `b = 2`.
- Messages need to be sent at moments `1`, `3`, and `5`.

The program will calculate:
- Interval `1` to `3`: `2 * 1 = 2` (energy used during this interval).
- Interval `3` to `5`: `2 * 1 = 2` (energy used during this interval).

Total energy used during intervals: `2 + 2 = 4`.
Energy cost of turning on/off: `2 * 2 = 4` (since there are two turns on/off).

Total energy required: `4 + 4 = 8`.

Since `8 < 10`, the program will output `Yes`. However, this is incorrect because the phone will run out of charge if turned on and off multiple times.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the process of turning the phone on and off and does not handle the energy consumption accurately. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to correctly simulate the energy consumption when the phone is turned on and off multiple times. It incorrectly calculates the total energy required and may give incorrect results for certain test cases.
