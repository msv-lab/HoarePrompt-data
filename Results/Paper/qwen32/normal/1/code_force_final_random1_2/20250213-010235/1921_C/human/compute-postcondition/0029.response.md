The code assigns the value of `feat[2]` to the variable `a`. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 1 greater than its previous value, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`.**
