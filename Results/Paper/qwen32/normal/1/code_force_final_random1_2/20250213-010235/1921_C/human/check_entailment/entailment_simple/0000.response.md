### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it against the problem requirements.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.
2. The phone starts with `f` units of charge and loses `a` units of charge per unit of time.
3. Turning the phone off and on consumes `b` units of charge.
4. The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It also reads the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes an empty list `array2`.
   - For each pair of consecutive message times `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`, it calculates the time difference `arr[i] - arr[i-1]`.
   - If this time difference is less than `b / a`, it appends the charge consumption `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` to `array2`.
   - After processing all pairs, it calculates the total charge used:
     - Sum of values in `array2` (charge consumed during periods where the phone stays on).
     - Plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` (charge consumed during periods where the phone is turned off and on).
   - It compares this total charge consumption with `f` and prints "Yes" if the total is less than `f`, otherwise "No".

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for Charge Calculation:**
  - The program only considers the charge consumption during periods where the phone stays on (`(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a`) if the time difference is less than `b / a`.
  - It does not account for the charge consumption during periods where the phone is turned off and on, even if the time difference is greater than or equal to `b / a`.
  - The condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is incorrect because it should consider whether it is more efficient to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again.

- **Incorrect Handling of Charge Comparison:**
  - The comparison `if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f` is incorrect because it assumes that every time the phone is turned off and on, the charge consumption is `b`, regardless of whether it was necessary or not.
  - The program should simulate the process of sending messages and turning the phone on and off as needed, keeping track of the remaining charge accurately.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
