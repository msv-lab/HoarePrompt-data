To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop's header. The loop header is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that the loop will iterate over the range starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. 

Let's analyze the provided state and identify which variables need adjustment:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This variable is not part of the loop header and does not affect the loop execution directly.)
- `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1 (This variable is not part of the loop header and does not affect the loop execution directly.)
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input (This variable is not part of the loop header and does not affect the loop execution directly.)
- `i` is 1 greater than its previous value (This variable is part of the loop header, but its initial value is set within the loop range, so we need to ensure `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.)
- `n` is `feat[0]` (This variable is part of the loop header and must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.)
- `f` is `feat[1]` (This variable is not part of the loop header and does not affect the loop execution directly.)
- `a` is `feat[2]` (This variable is not part of the loop header and does not affect the loop execution directly.)
- `b` is `feat[-1]` (This variable is not part of the loop header and does not affect the loop execution directly.)
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line (This variable is not part of the loop header and does not affect the loop execution directly.)
- `array2` is an empty list (This variable is not part of the loop header and does not affect the loop execution directly.)

Given this analysis, the only variable in the loop header that needs adjustment is `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 1 greater than its previous value, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is an empty list**
