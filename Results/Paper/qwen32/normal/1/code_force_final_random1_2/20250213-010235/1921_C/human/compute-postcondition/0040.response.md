To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and implicitly `arr` since it's used within the loop condition and body.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `i` is 1 greater than its previous value
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line
- If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains the element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` appended to it. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we know that `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n`.

### Step-by-step Adjustment:
1. **Adjust `i`:** Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.
2. **Adjust `n`:** The value of `n` does not change; it remains `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1.
3. **Adjust `arr`:** The list `arr` does not change during the loop iterations, so it remains the same.

### Example Calculation:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line**

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we'll represent it as `i + 1`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line**
