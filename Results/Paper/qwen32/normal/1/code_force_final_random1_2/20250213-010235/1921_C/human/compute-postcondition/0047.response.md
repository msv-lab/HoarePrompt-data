Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4.
   - `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `i` is set to `n` (which is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1).
   - `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1.
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is `feat[2]`.
   - `b` is `feat[-1]`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line.
   - `array2` contains all values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for which `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was true during the iterations.
   - The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('No')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.
   - There are no variables or conditions in the print statement that depend on the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `arr`, `array2`, `n`, `f`, `a`, or `b`.
   - The print statement is independent of any calculations or conditions derived from the input data.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the print statement is simply the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **No**
