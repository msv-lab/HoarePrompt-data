The given code snippet appends a calculated value to the `array2` list. Specifically, it calculates `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` and adds this value to `array2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input where the first element `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input
- `array2` is an empty list
- `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`

After executing the line `array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)`, the value of `array2` will include the newly appended element, which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input where the first element `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `array2` is a list containing the element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, and `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.**
