Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is a variable (its value is not specified).
- `n` is the first element of the list `feat` (`feat[0]`).
- `b` is the last element of the list `feat` (`feat[-1]`).
- `f` is the second element of the list `feat` (`feat[1]`).
- `a` is the third element of the list `feat` (`feat[2]`).
- `feat` is a list of integers.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `i` is set to the value of `n` (`i = n`).
- `array2` is constructed as follows:
  - It starts with `[arr[0] * a]` if `arr[0] < b / a`.
  - For each `j` from `1` to `n-1`, it includes `[(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a]` if `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a`.
- The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`. This means that regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `b`, `f`, `a`, `feat`, `arr`, `i`, or `array2`, the output will always be `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
