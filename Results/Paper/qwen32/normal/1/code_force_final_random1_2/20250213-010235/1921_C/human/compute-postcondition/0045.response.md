To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This represents the number of test cases).
   - `test_cases`: An integer that is greater than or equal to 1 (This indicates the current test case number).
   - `feat`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
     - `n`: The first element of `feat` (must be greater than 1). This represents the length of the array `arr`.
     - `f`: The second element of `feat`.
     - `a`: The third element of `feat`.
     - `b`: The last element of `feat`.
   - `arr`: A list of integers obtained from a new input line. It has `n` elements.
   - `array2`: A list that contains values calculated during the iterations. Specifically, it contains all values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for which `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was true during the iterations.
   - The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

2. **Condition for Printing 'Yes':**
   - The condition `sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f` must be true for the `print('Yes')` statement to execute.

Given these conditions, if the sum of the values in `array2` plus the product of the remaining elements (calculated as `(n - len(array2)) * b`) is indeed less than `f`, then the `print('Yes')` statement will execute.

**Explanation of the Output:**
The code prints 'Yes' if the calculated condition involving `array2`, `b`, `n`, and `f` is satisfied. Since the condition is explicitly stated in the problem and assumed to be true for the execution of the print statement, the output is simply 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
