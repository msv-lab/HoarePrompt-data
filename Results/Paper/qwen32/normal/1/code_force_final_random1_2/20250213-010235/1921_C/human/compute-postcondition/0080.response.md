The code snippet provided resets `array2` to an empty list. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `b`, `f`, `i`, `feat`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a variable, `array2` is [], `n` is `feat[0]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is `feat[2]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.**
