To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the description, we know:
- `i` is currently 1 greater than its previous value.
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1.
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `i` has just been incremented by 1.
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1.
- `f` is `feat[1]`.
- `a` is `feat[2]`.
- `b` is `feat[-1]`.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line.
- `array2` is modified based on the condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 again.
- `n` remains the same as it is determined by `feat[0]` and does not change within the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` remains `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 1 greater than its previous value, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains the element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.**
