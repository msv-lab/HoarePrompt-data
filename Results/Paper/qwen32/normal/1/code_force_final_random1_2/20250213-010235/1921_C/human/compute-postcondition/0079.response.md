The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`. This operation does not affect the existing variables `t`, `array2`, `n`, `b`, `f`, `i`, `feat`, or `a`.

Output State: **`t` is a variable, `array2` is a list of integers, `n` is `feat[0]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is `feat[2]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.**
