The given code snippet updates the `arr` variable by reading a new line of input and converting it into a list of integers. This means that the previous contents of `arr` are replaced with the new input values.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` remains an integer that is greater than or equal to 1.
- `feat` remains a list of integers obtained from the initial input.
- `i` remains `feat[0] + 1`.
- `n` remains `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1.
- `f` remains `feat[1]`.
- `a` remains `feat[2]`.
- `b` remains `feat[-1]`.
- `arr` is now a new list of integers obtained from the new input line.
- `array2` remains containing all values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for which `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was true during the iterations (note that since `arr` has been updated, `array2` would need to be recalculated based on this new `arr`).
- The comparison of the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` to `f` would also need to be recalculated based on the new `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `i` is `feat[0] + 1`, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` needs to be recalculated based on the new `arr`.**
