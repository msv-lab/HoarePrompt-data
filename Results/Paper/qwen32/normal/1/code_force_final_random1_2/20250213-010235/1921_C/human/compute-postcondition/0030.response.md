The code assigns the last element of the list `feat` to the variable `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 1 greater than its previous value, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`.**
