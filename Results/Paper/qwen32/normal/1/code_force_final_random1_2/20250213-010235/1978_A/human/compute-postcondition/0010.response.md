The code snippet provided reads a new integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This affects the value of `n` while the values of `t`, `nums`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is the newly input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1**.
