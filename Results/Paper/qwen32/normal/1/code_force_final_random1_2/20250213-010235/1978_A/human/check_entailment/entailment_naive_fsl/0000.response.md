Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The goal is to divide the books into two non-empty piles and maximize the sum of the largest book in each pile. However, the current implementation always takes the largest book from all but the last book (`max(nums[:-1])`) and adds it to the last book (`nums[-1]`). This approach does not guarantee the maximum possible sum of the largest books in each pile.

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7
```
This is because Alice can divide the books into piles `{1, 2, 3}` and `{4}`, reading the largest book from each pile, which are `3` and `4`, respectively. Thus, the total number of pages read is `3 + 4 = 7`.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
6
```
The program incorrectly calculates the result as `6` because it considers `max(1, 2, 3) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7` but due to its flawed logic, it might not always choose the optimal split.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases optimally.
