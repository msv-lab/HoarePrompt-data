The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `nums`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `_` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 500; `n` is the newly input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1.**
