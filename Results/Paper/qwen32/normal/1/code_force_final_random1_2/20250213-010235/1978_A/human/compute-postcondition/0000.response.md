The given code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This variable `t` represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 to 500. After executing the code, the value of `t` is updated to the integer read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.**
