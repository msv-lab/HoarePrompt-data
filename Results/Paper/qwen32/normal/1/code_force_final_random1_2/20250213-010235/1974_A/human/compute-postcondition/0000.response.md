The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `a`. This means that `a` will hold the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer within a specific range and that for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` within a specific range. These variables (`t`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` is an input integer.**
