Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input. If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is recalculated as `(x + y * 4 + 14) // 15` and `m` is recalculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. Otherwise, `z` retains its original value and `m` remains unchanged.**
