To determine the output of the `print(z)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the conditions under which `z` is calculated.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.
- There is a variable `m` whose initial value is not explicitly mentioned but is compared with `a`.
- Depending on the comparison between `m` and `a`, `z` is recalculated or retains its original value.

### Conditions:
1. If `m < a`, then:
   - `z` is recalculated as \((x + y \times 4 + 14) // 15\).
   - `m` is recalculated as \(15 \times z - y \times 4\).

2. If `m \geq a`, then:
   - `z` retains its original value.
   - `m` remains unchanged.

### Analysis:
- Since the initial value of `z` is not specified, we can only describe its value based on the conditions provided.
- The formula for recalculating `z` is \((x + y \times 4 + 14) // 15\), which is an integer division operation.
- The value of `z` depends on the values of `x` and `y`.

### Conclusion:
- If `m < a`, `z` will be recalculated using the formula \((x + y \times 4 + 14) // 15\).
- If `m \geq a`, `z` retains its original value, which is not specified in the problem statement.

Given that the problem does not specify the initial value of `z` or the value of `m`, we can only describe the recalculated value of `z` if `m < a`.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(z)` statement will print the value of `z`. If `m < a`, `z` is recalculated as \((x + y \times 4 + 14) // 15\). Otherwise, `z` retains its original value, which is not provided.

Output: **z (where z is recalculated as (x + y * 4 + 14) // 15 if m < a, otherwise it retains its original value)**
