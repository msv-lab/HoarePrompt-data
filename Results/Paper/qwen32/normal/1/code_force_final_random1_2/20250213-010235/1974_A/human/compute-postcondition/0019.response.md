The value of `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. Given that `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, we substitute `z` into the equation for `m`.

Thus, `m = 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.

The values of `t`, `a`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input, `i` is 4, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.**
