The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's assume it was `i-1`), and `a` is greater than 0.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, if `i` was `i-1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i`.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the exact value of `i`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i+1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`. If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15`, `i` is `i + 1`**
