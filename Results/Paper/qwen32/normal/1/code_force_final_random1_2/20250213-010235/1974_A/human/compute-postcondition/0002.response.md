The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, there are two integers `x` and `y` within the range 0 to 99. Additionally, `a` must be greater than 0.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to the integers read from the input. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.**
