Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all input strings), `ans` is 'YES', `i` is `n-1`, `impossible` is True, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (i.e., `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), and either `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`.**
