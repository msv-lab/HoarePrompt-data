To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. However, since `i` is currently `n - 2`, incrementing it by 1 would make `i` equal to `n - 1`, which is the loop's termination condition. Therefore, the loop cannot execute another iteration.

However, if we were to consider the hypothetical scenario where we want to adjust the state as if the loop were to continue, we would increment `i` by 1. But since the loop terminates when `i` reaches `n - 1`, the actual state at the start of the next iteration does not exist.

Nonetheless, for the sake of adhering to the task format, let's assume we are adjusting the state hypothetically:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all input strings), `i` is `n-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (i.e., `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). If the first character of the `i`-th string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)`-th string in `gr` or the last character of the `i`-th string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the `(i+1)`-th string in `gr`, then `impossible` is `False`; otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. `ans` is 'NO'**.

But remember, in reality, the loop terminates when `i` reaches `n - 1`.
