The code appends a new string (read from the input) to the list `gr`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0; `m` is the second integer read from the input; `tc` is 1; `gr` is a list containing three strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; `i` is 2**.
