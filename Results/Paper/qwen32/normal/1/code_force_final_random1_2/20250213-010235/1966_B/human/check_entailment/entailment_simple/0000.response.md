### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine whether it's possible to make all squares in a given grid the same color using the specified operations. The logic in the program is based on the observation that if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid are of different colors, then it might be impossible to make the entire grid uniform unless certain conditions are met.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and then reads the grid itself into a list of strings `gr`.

2. **Initial Assumption**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `'YES'`, assuming that it is possible to make the grid uniform.

3. **Checking Corner Colors**: If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are of different colors, the program sets a flag `impossible` to `True`.

4. **Horizontal Check**: The program then checks each row to see if there is any change in color along the first and last columns. If any change is found, `impossible` is set to `False`. This check ensures that if the corners are different, there must be a way to propagate the color from one corner to the other horizontally.

5. **Vertical Check**: Similarly, the program checks each column to see if there is any change in color along the first and last rows. If any change is found, `impossible` is set to `False`. This check ensures that if the corners are different, there must be a way to propagate the color from one corner to the other vertically.

6. **Final Decision**: If `impossible` remains `True` after both horizontal and vertical checks, it means that the corners are different and there is no way to propagate the color from one corner to the other, making it impossible to make the grid uniform. In this case, `ans` is set to `'NO'`.

7. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Evaluation:

The program correctly implements the logic described above. It efficiently checks the necessary conditions to determine if the grid can be made uniform. The checks for horizontal and vertical consistency ensure that if the corners are different, there must be a path to propagate the color from one corner to the other, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Given the provided logic and the checks implemented in the program, the solution appears to be correct based on the problem description and the sample test cases.

**Correctness: True**
