The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tc` and `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is `'NO'` and `i` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'` and `i` is `n - 1`.**
