The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

The value of `n` does not change; it remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `i` is 2, and `ans` is `'NO'`. If the first character of `gr[i]` is different from the first character of `gr[i + 1]` or the last character of `gr[i]` is different from the last character of `gr[i + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**
