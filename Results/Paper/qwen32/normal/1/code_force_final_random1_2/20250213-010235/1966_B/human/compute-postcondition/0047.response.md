The code snippet `gr = []` reassigns the variable `gr` to an empty list. This means the previous list stored in `gr` is discarded and `gr` now holds an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the input; `m` is the second integer read from the input; `tc` is 1; `gr` is an empty list; if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is `'NO'`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.**
