Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all input strings), `i` is `n-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (i.e., `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO'.**

Explanation: The variable `impossible` is set to `True`, which changes the value of `ans` to 'NO'. All other variables retain their initial values.
