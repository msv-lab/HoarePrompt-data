Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0; `m` is the second integer read from the input; `tc` is 1; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'` if `gr[0][0]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, otherwise `'NO'`; `i` is `n - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The variable `n` (number of rows) and `m` (number of columns) are as initially read from the input, with `n` being greater than 0.
- The variable `tc` remains 1.
- The list `gr` will contain exactly `n` strings, each representing a row of input.
- The variable `ans` will be `'YES'` if the first character of the first row (`gr[0][0]`) matches the last character of the last row (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), otherwise it will be `'NO'`.
- The loop index `i` will be `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `n` iterations.
