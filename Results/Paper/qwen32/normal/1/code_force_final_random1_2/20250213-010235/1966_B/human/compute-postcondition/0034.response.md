The given code snippet only initializes a new variable `impossible` to `False`. None of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `grid`, `tc`, `gr`, `ans`, `i`) are modified. The condition that the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 2, the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `ans` is `'NO'`, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `impossible` is `False`.**
