The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again, making it `i + 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `grid`, `tc`, `gr`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

Given that `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `i + 1` strings read from the input; `i` is `i + 2`**
