The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the input provided.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is already the first integer read from the input and `m` is the second integer read from the input, the code snippet essentially reassigns these values. However, since the problem does not specify new values for `n` and `m` through the input in this context, we assume the values remain as they were initially described.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `tc`, `gr`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only variables that are affected are `n` and `m`, but since their values are being reassigned to what they already are, there is no actual change in their values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is `'NO'` and `i` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'` and `i` is `n - 1`.**
