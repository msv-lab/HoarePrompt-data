The code sets the variable `impossible` to `True`. This change affects the value of `impossible` only. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `impossible` is now `True`, `ans` will be set to `'NO'` if it hasn't already been set to `'NO'` due to another condition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is 0; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'NO'`; the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`); `impossible` is `True`.**
