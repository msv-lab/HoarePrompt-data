The code appends the input to the list `gr`. Since `gr` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `gr` will contain one element, which is the input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing one element (the input string), `ans` and `i` are undefined.**
