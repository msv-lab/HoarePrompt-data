Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, and then a grid of size `n` by `m` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not specified in detail here but could involve some computation or analysis of the grid.**
