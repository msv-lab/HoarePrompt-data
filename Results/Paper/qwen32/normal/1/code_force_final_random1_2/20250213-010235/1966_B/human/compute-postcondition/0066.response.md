The given code snippet initializes a variable `impossible` to `False`. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `tc`, `gr`, `ans`, `i`, `j`). The only change is the introduction of the new variable `impossible`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `tc` is 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `ans` is `'YES'`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `j + 2`, `impossible` is `False`**.
