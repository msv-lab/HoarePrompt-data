Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `i` is `n - 1`, `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is `'NO'` because at least one pair of adjacent characters in the first and last strings of `gr` differ at any position from `0` to `m - 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `impossible` is set to `True`, which changes the value of `ans` to `'NO'` according to the given conditions. All other variables remain unchanged.
