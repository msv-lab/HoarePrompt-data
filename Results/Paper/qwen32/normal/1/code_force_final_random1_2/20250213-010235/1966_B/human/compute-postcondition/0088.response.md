Let's analyze the given initial state and determine the value of `ans` that will be printed:

1. **Variables and Initial Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0.
   - `m` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `tc` is initialized to 1.
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input.
   - The value of `ans` depends on the comparison `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`.

2. **Determine `ans`:**
   - If `gr[0][0]` (the first character of the first string in `gr`) is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` (the last character of the last string in `gr`), then `ans` is set to `'NO'`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`.

Given these conditions, the output will depend on the specific values of `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`. Since the exact values of these characters are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the condition given.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'NO' if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1], otherwise 'YES')**
