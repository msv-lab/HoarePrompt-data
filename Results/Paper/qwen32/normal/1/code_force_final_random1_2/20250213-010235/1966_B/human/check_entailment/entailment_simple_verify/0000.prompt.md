You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an `n x m` grid of squares colored either 'W' (white) or 'B' (black).
- We can perform operations where we select two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them with that color.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using any number of such operations.

### Program Analysis:
The program checks if it's possible to make the entire grid the same color by examining the corners and edges of the grid. Specifically:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid and the grid itself.
3. It initializes the answer as 'YES'.
4. If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are different, it checks:
   - If all elements in the first row are the same.
   - If all elements in the last row are the same.
   - If all elements in the first column are the same.
   - If all elements in the last column are the same.
5. If any of these conditions are not met, it sets the answer to 'NO'.
6. It prints the answer for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
The program seems to rely heavily on the corners and edges of the grid. However, this approach might miss certain configurations where the grid can still be made uniform through operations on internal subrectangles. Let's consider a few cases:

#### Case 1:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
Here, the top-left and bottom-right corners are different ('W' and 'B'), but the grid can be made uniform by selecting (1,1) and (2,2) and then (1,2) and (2,1).

#### Case 2:
```
3 3
WBW
BWB
WBW
```
Here, the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same ('W'), but the grid cannot be made uniform because the middle element ('B') cannot be changed without affecting other elements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for configurations where the grid can be made uniform through operations on internal subrectangles, not just by examining the corners and edges.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly assumes that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same and the edges are uniform, the entire grid can be made uniform. This is not always true, as demonstrated by the counterexamples above. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
