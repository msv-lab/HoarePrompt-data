To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can see that the only variable that can be adjusted is `j`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `tc` is 1
- `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input
- `ans` is `'YES'`
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is `j + 1`
- Additional conditions about `impossible` based on certain comparisons.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. Therefore, if `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `j + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the only change needed is to increment `j` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `tc` is 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `ans` is `'YES'`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `j + 2`**
