Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`. Additionally, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`); `impossible` is `True`.**

Explanation: The variable `impossible` is set to `True`, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
