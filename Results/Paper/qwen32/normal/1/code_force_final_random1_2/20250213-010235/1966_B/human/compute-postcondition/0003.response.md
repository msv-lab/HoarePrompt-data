The given code snippet only initializes an empty list named `gr`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, the grid, or `tc`. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new variable `gr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is an empty list.**
