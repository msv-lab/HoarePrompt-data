Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an `n x m` grid of squares colored either 'W' (white) or 'B' (black).
- We can perform operations where we select two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them with that color.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using any number of such operations.

### Program Analysis:
The program checks if it's possible to make the entire grid the same color by examining the corners and edges of the grid. Specifically:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid and the grid itself.
3. It initializes the answer as 'YES'.
4. If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are different, it checks:
   - If all elements in the first row are the same.
   - If all elements in the last row are the same.
   - If all elements in the first column are the same.
   - If all elements in the last column are the same.
5. If any of these conditions are not met, it sets the answer to 'NO'.
6. It prints the answer for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
The program seems to rely heavily on the corners and edges of the grid. However, this approach might miss certain configurations where the grid can still be made uniform through operations on internal subrectangles. Let's consider a few cases:

#### Case 1:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
Here, the top-left and bottom-right corners are different ('W' and 'B'), but the grid can be made uniform by selecting (1,1) and (2,2) and then (1,2) and (2,1).

#### Case 2:
```
3 3
WBW
BWB
WBW
```
Here, the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same ('W'), but the grid cannot be made uniform because the middle element ('B') cannot be changed without affecting other elements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for configurations where the grid can be made uniform through operations on internal subrectangles, not just by examining the corners and edges.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly assumes that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same and the edges are uniform, the entire grid can be made uniform. This is not always true, as demonstrated by the counterexamples above. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
