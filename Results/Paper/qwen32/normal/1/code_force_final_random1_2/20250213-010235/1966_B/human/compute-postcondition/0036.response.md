The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this variable. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The loop condition is `i in range(n - 1)`, meaning the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value (which is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration). Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `k + 1`.

Given that the loop runs while `i < n - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must still be less than `n - 1`, implying `i` must currently be less than `n - 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 2, the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `ans` is `'NO'`, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is set to `False`.**

Since `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 2, the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `ans` is `'NO'`, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `i` is `i + 1`. If `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is set to `False`.**
