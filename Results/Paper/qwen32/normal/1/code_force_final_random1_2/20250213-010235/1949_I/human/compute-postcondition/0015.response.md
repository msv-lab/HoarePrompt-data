Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of integers with length `n` where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the `i-th` input, `y` is a list of integers with length `n` where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the `i-th` input, `r` is a list of integers with length `n` where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the `i-th` input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**

Explanation: The variable `ok` is set to `False`, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
