The code snippet `coef = [None] * n` assigns a new list to the variable `coef`, where the list contains `n` elements, each initialized to `None`. This operation does not affect the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`).

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000); `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**
