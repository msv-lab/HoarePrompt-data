The code snippet reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]`. Given the initial state, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` already hold the first, second, and third integers from the input respectively. After executing the code, these values will be updated with new integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `x[i]` which is the first integer from the new input, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `y[i]` which is the second integer from the new input, `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `r[i]` which is the third integer from the new input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
