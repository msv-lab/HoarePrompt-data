n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all i in the range [0, n-1]. visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, and coef is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.
