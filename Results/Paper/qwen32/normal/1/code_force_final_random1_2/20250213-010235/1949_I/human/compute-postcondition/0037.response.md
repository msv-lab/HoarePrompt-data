Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000); `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` (some may be updated to `True` depending on the `dfs` logic); `coef` is a list of integers with length `n` (some values may be updated depending on the `dfs` logic); `tot` is an integer (value may be updated depending on the `dfs` logic); `bipartite` is a boolean (value may be updated depending on the `dfs` logic); `ok` is `True` if `ok` was `True` or `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0`, otherwise `ok` is `False`; `i` is 2. If `visited[i]` was `False`, `visited` may have been updated and `coef[i]` may have been set to `-1` depending on the `dfs` logic. If `visited[i]` was already `True`, there are no changes to `visited` or `coef`.**
