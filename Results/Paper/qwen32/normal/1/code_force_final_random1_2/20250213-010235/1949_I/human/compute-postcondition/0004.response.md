The code reassigns the `visited` list to a new list of `False` values, each corresponding to the length `n`. This means all elements in the `visited` list are now `False`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000); `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`; `coef` is a list of `None` values.**
