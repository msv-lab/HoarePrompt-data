Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of integers with length `n` where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the `i-th` input, `y` is a list of integers with length `n` where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the `i-th` input, `r` is a list of integers with length `n` where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the `i-th` input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except possibly `visited[i]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except possibly `coef[i]` which is `1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`. If `visited[i]` was initially `False`, then `visited[i]` is now `True` and `coef[i]` is `1`. Otherwise, `visited` and `coef` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000); `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which is `True`. If `visited[1]` was `False` before the if statement, now `visited[1]` is `True` and `coef[1]` is `-1`. If `visited[1]` was already `True` before the if statement, there are no changes to `visited` or `coef`. `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is `True`; `ok` is `False`; `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000); `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` (some may be updated to `True` depending on the `dfs` logic); `coef` is a list of integers with length `n` (some values may be updated depending on the `dfs` logic); `tot` is an integer (value may be updated depending on the `dfs` logic); `bipartite` is a boolean (value may be updated depending on the `dfs` logic); `ok` is `True` if `ok` was `True` or `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0`, otherwise `ok` is `False`; `i` is 2. If `visited[i]` was `False`, `visited` may have been updated and `coef[i]` may have been set to `-1` depending on the `dfs` logic. If `visited[i]` was already `True`, there are no changes to `visited` or `coef`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
