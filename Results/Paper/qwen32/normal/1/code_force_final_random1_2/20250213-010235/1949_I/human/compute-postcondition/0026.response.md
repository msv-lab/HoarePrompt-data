Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which is `1` and `coef[1]` which is `1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The only change made by the code is setting `tot` to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
