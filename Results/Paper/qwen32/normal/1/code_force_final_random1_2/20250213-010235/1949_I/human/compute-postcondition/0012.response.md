After the loop has executed all its iterations, each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will have been updated with integer values from the input. Specifically, for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` will hold the three integers provided in the `i-th` input line. The lists `visited` and `coef` will remain as they were initially, consisting of `False` values and `None` values respectively, since these lists are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of integers with length `n` where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the `i-th` input, `y` is a list of integers with length `n` where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the `i-th` input, `r` is a list of integers with length `n` where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the `i-th` input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**
