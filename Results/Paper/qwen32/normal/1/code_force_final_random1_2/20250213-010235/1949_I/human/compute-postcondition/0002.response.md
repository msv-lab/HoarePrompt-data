Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000); `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers where `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk, with `-10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9` and `1 <= r[i] <= 10^9` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`; `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values.**

Explanation: The list `y` has been reassigned to a new list of `None` values with the same length `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
