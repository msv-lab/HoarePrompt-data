The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the list `a`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
