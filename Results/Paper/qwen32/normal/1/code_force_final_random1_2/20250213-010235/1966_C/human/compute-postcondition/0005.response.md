The code snippet assigns the value of `len(arr) - 1` to the variable `n`. Given that `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end, the length of `arr` is at least 1 (due to the appended `0`). Therefore, `n` will be at least `0`.

Since `arr` has a length of at least 1, and `n` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, `n` will be the index of the last element in the list `arr`, which is `0`.

Other variables (`t`, `tc`, `dp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` is at least 1; For each test case, `n` is `len(arr) - 1` (which is the index of the last element in `arr`, i.e., `0`); `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end; `dp` is True.**
