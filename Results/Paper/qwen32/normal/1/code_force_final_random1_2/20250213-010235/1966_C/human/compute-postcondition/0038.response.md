The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper bound of the loop.

So, `i` should be 3 for the next iteration to proceed, and `n` should remain the same since it is the length of `arr` minus 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is `True` if `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` else `False`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 (at least 2), `i` is 3**
