Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` must be at least 2, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is `(arr[2] - arr[3] > 1) or not (arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not dp)`, `n` is `len(arr) - 1` where `len(arr) > 2`, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `dp` is determined by evaluating `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not (arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not dp)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
