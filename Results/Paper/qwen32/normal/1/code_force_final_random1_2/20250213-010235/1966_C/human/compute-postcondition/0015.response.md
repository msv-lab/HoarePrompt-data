To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition. The loop continues as long as `tc > 0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` is at least 1 and now `tc` is `tc - 1`.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end.
- `dp` is the result of the condition `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp` after the last iteration.
- `n` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

The loop condition is `while tc > 0:`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `tc` must still be greater than 0.

Since `tc` is decremented by 1 in each iteration (`tc` is `tc - 1`), for the loop to execute again, `tc` must have been at least 2 before the decrement (so that after decrementing, it remains greater than 0).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `tc` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end, `dp` is the result of the condition `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp` after the last iteration, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `i` is `n-1`**.
