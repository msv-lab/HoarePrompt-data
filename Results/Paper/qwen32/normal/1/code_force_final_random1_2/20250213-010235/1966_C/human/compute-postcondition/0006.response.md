To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute, the range `(1, n)` must contain at least one integer. This means `n` must be greater than 1.

Let's analyze the given state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` is at least 1.
- For each test case, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end.
- `dp` is True.

From the loop definition, we know that `i` starts at 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Given that `n` is defined as `len(arr) - 1`, for `n` to be greater than 1, `len(arr)` must be greater than 2. This means `arr` must have at least 3 elements (since one element is the appended `0`).

So, the adjustments needed are:
- Ensure that `n` is greater than 1, which implies `arr` must have at least 3 elements.

Since `i` is initialized to 1 automatically by the `range(1, n)` function, no specific adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end, and `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is True, `n` is len(arr) - 1 and must be greater than 1**.
