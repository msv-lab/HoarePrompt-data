To determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the logic and compare it against the rules of the game.

### Game Analysis
The game involves removing stones from piles such that the number of stones removed from each non-empty pile is the same and is at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile. The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Key Observations
- The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory.
- If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move (assuming optimal play).
- If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the position is winning for the player about to move.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True) + [0]
        dp = True
        n = len(arr) - 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
        print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1
```

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program does not compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes. Instead, it sorts the unique pile sizes in descending order and checks a condition related to the differences between consecutive elements. This logic does not determine the winner correctly.
2. **Simplification Error**: The condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` does not reflect the game's rules or the optimal strategy. It seems to be an attempt to simplify the problem incorrectly.

#### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes for each test case. Here's how it should be done:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for pile in arr:
            nim_sum ^= pile
        print('Alice' if nim_sum != 0 else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1
```

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
