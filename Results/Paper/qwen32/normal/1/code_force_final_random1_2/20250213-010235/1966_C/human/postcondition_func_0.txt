The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins based on the condition that no two consecutive numbers in the sorted, unique list of integers differ by more than 1. It outputs 'Alice' if the condition is met for all consecutive pairs, otherwise 'Bob'.
