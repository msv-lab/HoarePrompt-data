The code snippet reads a line of input from the file opened with `open(0)`, splits it into three integers, and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. Given that `b` was originally defined as `b` plus `c`, the new value of `b` from the input will overwrite the previous definition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is the first integer from the input line, `b` is the second integer from the input line, `c` is the third integer from the input line, `s` is the next line of input from the file opened with `open(0)`**.
