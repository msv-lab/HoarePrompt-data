You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
        
        b += c
        
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is the integer from the last test case, `b` is the sum of the second and third integers from the last test case, and `c` is the third integer from the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis

The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Problem Description Recap

- **Introverts (a)**: Must stay alone in a tent.
- **Extroverts (b)**: Must stay in a tent with exactly two others.
- **Universals (c)**: Can stay alone, with one other, or with two others.
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or determine if it's impossible (`-1`).

### Code Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it splits the input into `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program adds `c` to `b`. This suggests treating universals as flexible individuals who can be paired with extroverts.
   - It then calculates the number of tents needed for introverts (`a`) and the combined group of extroverts and universals (`b + c`).
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` seems to be calculating the minimum number of tents required:
     - `-b // 3` computes the number of tents needed for groups of three (extroverts and universals).
     - `a` is added to this value to account for introverts.
     - The ternary-like expression checks if `c < b % 3`. If true, it returns `-1`, indicating an impossible configuration.

### Potential Issues

Let's consider the logic in detail:

- **Handling Extroverts and Universals**:
  - The program assumes that universals can be freely used to fill incomplete groups of extroverts.
  - However, it doesn't ensure that the remaining universals can be paired correctly after forming groups of three with extroverts.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Consider a scenario where `a = 0`, `b = 1`, and `c = 1`. Here, one extrovert needs two others, but there is only one universal available. The program would incorrectly calculate the number of tents as `0 - (-2 // 3) = 1`, which is incorrect because it's impossible to form a group of three with just one universal.
  
### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the remaining universals can be paired appropriately after forming groups of three with extroverts.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The program incorrectly calculates the number of tents in scenarios where the remaining universals cannot be paired to satisfy the extroverts' requirement of being in a tent with two others. For example, with `a = 0`, `b = 1`, and `c = 1`, the program outputs `1` instead of `-1`.
