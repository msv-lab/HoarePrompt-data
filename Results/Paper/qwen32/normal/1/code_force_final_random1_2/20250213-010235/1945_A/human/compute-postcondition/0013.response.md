Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, the function determines and returns whether the numbers can form a valid triangle. Specifically, it returns "YES" if the numbers satisfy the triangle inequality (i.e., the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side); otherwise, it returns "NO".**
