The provided code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, s.split())` splits a string `s` into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. 

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and there are at least `t` lines of input following the first line, where each line contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.

After executing the code snippet, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the integer values from the split string `s`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the precondition about the range of `t` and the constraints on `a`, `b`, and `c` still holds.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers derived from splitting and converting the string `s` where 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.**
