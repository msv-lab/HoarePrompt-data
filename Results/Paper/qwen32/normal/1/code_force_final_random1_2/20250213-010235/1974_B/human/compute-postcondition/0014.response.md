The code snippet `unique_chars.insert(i, char)` inserts the character `char` at index `i` in the list `unique_chars`. Given the initial conditions:

- If `char` was already in `unique_chars`, `i` is 0, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`.
- If `char` was not in `unique_chars`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `len(unique_chars)`. Additionally, `char` is added to `unique_chars` before this operation.

After the insertion:
- If `char` was already in `unique_chars`, it will now appear twice, once at the beginning of the list and once at its original position.
- If `char` was not in `unique_chars`, it will be inserted at index 1, and the list will have one more element.

Since `char` is now definitely in `unique_chars`, the list `unique_chars` will have `char` at index `i`, and the length of `unique_chars` will increase by 1 if `char` was not previously in the list.

Output State: **`s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`. If `char` was not in `unique_chars` before the operation, `i` is 1, otherwise, `i` is 0. `j` is updated to `len(unique_chars) - 1`. `char` is the next element in the list `s`.**
