The code initializes two variables, `i` and `j`. The variable `i` is set to 0, and `j` is set to the last index of the `unique_chars` list, which is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.

Given the initial state, the only changes are the assignments to `i` and `j`. The list `s` and the list `unique_chars` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s`. `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.**
