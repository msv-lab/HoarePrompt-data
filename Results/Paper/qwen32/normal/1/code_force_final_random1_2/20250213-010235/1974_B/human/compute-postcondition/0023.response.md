The code snippet provided only increments the value of `j` by 1. None of the other variables (`s`, `unique_chars`, `char`, `i`) are affected by this operation.

Given that `j` is incremented, the new value of `j` will be its previous value plus one. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `j`, we can only express the new value of `j` in terms of its previous value.

Output State: **`s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`. `char` is the next element in the list `s`. `i` is increased by 1. `j` is increased by 1.**
