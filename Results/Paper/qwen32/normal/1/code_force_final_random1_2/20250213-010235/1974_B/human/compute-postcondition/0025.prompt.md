Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s`. `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for char in s:
    if char in unique_chars:
        s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
        j -= 1
    else:
        unique_chars.insert(i, char)
        i += 1
        j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s`. If `char` was in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `i` is 0, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`. If `char` was not in `unique_chars`, `char` is now the first element of `unique_chars`, making it potentially unsorted, `i` is 1, and `j` is `len(unique_chars)`. Additionally, `char` is in `unique_chars`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s`. If `char` was in `unique_chars` before the operation, each occurrence of `char` in `s` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `unique_chars` remains unchanged, `i` remains 0, and `j` is decreased by 1. If `char` was not in `unique_chars` before the operation, `s` remains unchanged except that `char` is inserted at index `i` in `unique_chars`, making it potentially unsorted, `i` is increased to 1, and `j` is updated to `len(unique_chars)`. `char` is the next element in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s`. If `char` was in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in the strings of `s` is replaced with `unique_chars[j]` and `j` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `char` is inserted at index `i` in `unique_chars`, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1. `char` is the next element in the list `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
