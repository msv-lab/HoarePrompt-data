Output State: **`s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s` with `char` inserted at the beginning, making it potentially unsorted. `i` is 1, `j` is `len(unique_chars)`. Additionally, `char` is in `unique_chars`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `j` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to the length of `unique_chars`. All other variables remain unchanged.
