Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s`. If `char` was in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in the strings of `s` is replaced with `unique_chars[j]` and `j` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `char` is inserted at index `i` in `unique_chars`, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1. `char` is the next element in the list `s`.**
