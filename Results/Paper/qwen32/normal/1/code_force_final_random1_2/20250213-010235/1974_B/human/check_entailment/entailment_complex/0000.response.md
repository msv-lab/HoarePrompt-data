### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - The string `r` is constructed from the unique characters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
   - Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process.
   - We need to identify the unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sort them alphabetically to form `r`.
   - Then, each character in `b` should be replaced by its symmetric character from `r` (the first character of `b` should be replaced by the last character of `r`, the second by the second last, and so on).

3. **Issues in the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` but instead, it attempts to replace characters in `b` with characters from `unique_chars` in a manner that does not match the decoding process.
   - The code incorrectly uses `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` inside a loop, which replaces all occurrences of `char` in `s` with `unique_chars[j]`. This is not the intended behavior.
   - The code also incorrectly handles the insertion of characters into `unique_chars` and the decrement/increment of indices `i` and `j`, leading to incorrect results.

### Correct Implementation Outline:
- Extract unique characters from `b` and sort them to form `r`.
- Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
- Replace each character in `b` using this mapping to get the original string `s`.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` to obtain the original string `s`.

**Correctness:** **False**
