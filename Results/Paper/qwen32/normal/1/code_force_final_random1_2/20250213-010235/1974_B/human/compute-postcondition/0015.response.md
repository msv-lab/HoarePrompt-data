Output State: **`s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`. If `char` was not in `unique_chars` before the operation, `i` is 1, otherwise, `i` is 0. `j` is updated to `len(unique_chars) - 1`. `char` is the next element in the list `s`. `i` is increased by 1.**
