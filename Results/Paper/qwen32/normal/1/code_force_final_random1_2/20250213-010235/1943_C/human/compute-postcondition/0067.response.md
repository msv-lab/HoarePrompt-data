Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to each node, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and its predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to `b`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` includes tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and `c` is the value at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even and at least 3, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from `1` to `2k-3`, where `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2` and `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.**
