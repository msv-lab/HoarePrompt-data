The given Python code snippet appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. This operation does not affect any other variables except `ops`, which now includes the new tuple.

Here's the updated state:

- `u2vs` remains a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`.
- `d` remains a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm.
- `a` remains the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous` remains a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`.
- `b` remains the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` remains a list containing `b` and all its predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to `b`, ending with the start node `0`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd.
- `ops` now includes the new tuple `(c, i)`.
- `ci` remains the middle index of `path_ba`, calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2`.
- `c` remains the value at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`.
- `i` remains `i_prev + 1`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to each node, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and its predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to `b` with an odd length, `ops` includes the new tuple `(c, i)`, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `c` is the value at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**
