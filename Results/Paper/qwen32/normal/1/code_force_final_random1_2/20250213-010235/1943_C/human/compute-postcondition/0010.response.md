Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n+1` lists, where the list at index `v` contains the value `v` and the new value `u`; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input; `n` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `u` has been decremented by 1, while the values of `u2vs`, `v`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
