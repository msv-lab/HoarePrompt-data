Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing `b` followed by `n`. `n` is the predecessor of `path_ba[-2]` in the shortest path from node `0` to `path_ba[-2]`. If `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing `b`, `n`, and the newly appended `n`. `n` is the predecessor of `path_ba[-2]` in the shortest path from node `0` to `path_ba[-2]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing `b`, `n`, and the newly appended `n`. If `n` equals `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
