The code snippet assigns the value of `c2 - 1` to `c1`. Given that `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, the new value of `c1` will be `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and all its predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to `b`, ending with the start node `0`. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even. `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`. `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.**
