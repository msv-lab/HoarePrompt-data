Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing `b`, `n`, and the newly appended `n`. If `n` equals `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `path_ba` now includes an additional element, which is the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
