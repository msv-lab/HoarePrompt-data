To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1(d)` does. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that it processes the list `d` in some way and returns a value or modifies it. However, without the definition of `func_1`, we can only infer that `a` will be assigned the result of `func_1(d)`.

Given that the exact behavior of `func_1` is unknown, we can only state that `a` is now assigned whatever value `func_1(d)` returns. The list `u2vs` and the list `d` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**
