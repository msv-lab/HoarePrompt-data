The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This changes the values of `u` and `v` based on the input provided, while the other variables (`u2vs`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n+1` lists, where the list at index `v` contains the value `v` and the new value `u`; `u` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; `n` is increased by 1.**
