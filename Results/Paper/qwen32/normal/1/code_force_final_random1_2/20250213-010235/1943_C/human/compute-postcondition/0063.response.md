To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the range parameters.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists.
- `d` is a list of shortest distances.
- `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous` is a list of predecessors.
- `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and its predecessors with a length of at least 3.
- `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` and the newly appended tuple `(len(path_ba) // 2, i + 2)`.
- `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
- `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.
- `i` is `i + 2`.

Let's analyze the loop range:
- The loop starts at `1`.
- It ends at `len(path_ba) - c1`.
- It increments by `2` each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by `2`, so `i` is now `i + 2`.

For the loop to execute again, `i + 2` must be less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.

Given that `c1 = len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`, we can rewrite the end condition as:
- `i + 2 < len(path_ba) - (len(path_ba) // 2 - 1)`
- Simplifying, `i + 2 < len(path_ba) - len(path_ba) // 2 + 1`
- Further simplifying, `i + 2 < (len(path_ba) + 1) // 2`

So, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be `i + 2` and it must satisfy the condition above.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is a list of shortest distances, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of predecessors, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and its predecessors with a length of at least 3, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` and the newly appended tuple `(len(path_ba) // 2, i + 2)`, `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`, `i` is `i + 2`**
