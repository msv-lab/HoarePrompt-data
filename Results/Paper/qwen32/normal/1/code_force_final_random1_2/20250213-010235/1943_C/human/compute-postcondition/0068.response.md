To determine the output of the `print(len(ops))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the `ops` list is constructed based on the given conditions.

### Initial State Recap:
- `u2vs`: A list of `n` lists (not directly relevant to the calculation of `ops`).
- `d`: A list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes.
- `a`: The result of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous`: A list of predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to each node.
- `b`: The result of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba`: A list containing `b` and its predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to `b`.

### Construction of `ops`:
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` includes tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and `c` is the value at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even and at least 3, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from `1` to `2k-3`, where `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2` and `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.

### Analysis:
- Let's denote the length of `path_ba` as `L`.
- If `L` is odd, `ops` will have `ci + 1` elements, where `ci` is the middle index (`ci = L // 2`).
- If `L` is even and at least 3, `ops` will have `(L // 2 - 1)` pairs of tuples, resulting in `2 * (L // 2 - 1)` elements.

### Calculation:
- If `L` is odd, `len(ops) = L // 2 + 1`.
- If `L` is even and at least 3, `len(ops) = 2 * (L // 2 - 1)`.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `L`.

### Final Output:
The length of `ops` depends on the length of `path_ba` (`L`). If `L` is odd, `len(ops) = L // 2 + 1`. If `L` is even and at least 3, `len(ops) = 2 * (L // 2 - 1)`.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is determined by the length of path_ba: if L is odd, len(ops) = L // 2 + 1; if L is even and at least 3, len(ops) = 2 * (L // 2 - 1))**
