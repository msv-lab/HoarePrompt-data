Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `u2vs`, which is a list of lists containing integers representing the neighbors of each vertex in a tree, and `n`, which is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. The function assumes that the tree is connected and undirected. The function does not perform any operations and simply returns `None`.**
