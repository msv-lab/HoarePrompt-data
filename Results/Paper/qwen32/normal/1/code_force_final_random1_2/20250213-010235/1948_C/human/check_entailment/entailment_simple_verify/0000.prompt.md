You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

        for i in range(1, n, 2):

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop `for i in range(1, n, 2):` only checks every second column starting from the second column. This means it skips checking some columns and does not cover all possible paths the robot can take.
2. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition inside the loop `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is flawed. It does not properly check if the robot can move from one cell to another according to the rules specified in the problem statement.
3. **No Proper Path Checking**: The program does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step to see if it can reach the target cell (2, n).

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        
        # Starting position
        x, y = 1, 1
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        while (x, y) != (2, n):
            if x == 1:
                if a[y-1] == '>':
                    y += 1
                else:
                    x = 2
            else:
                if b[y-1] == '<':
                    y -= 1
                else:
                    x = 1
            
            # Check if the robot is out of bounds
            if y < 1 or y > n:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: The robot starts at position (1, 1).
2. **Simulation Loop**: The robot moves according to the arrows in the grid until it either reaches (2, n) or goes out of bounds.
3. **Boundary Checks**: The program checks if the robot's position is within the grid boundaries after each move.
4. **Output**: If the robot reaches (2, n), it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This corrected program ensures that all possible movements are considered and accurately determines if the robot can reach the target cell.
