The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer representation of the user's input. The initial state mentions that the loop completes all iterations without breaking and prints "Yes", and `t` is incremented by 1. Since these conditions are not directly related to the execution of the given code snippet, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **the loop completes all iterations without breaking, and it prints "Yes"; `t` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer.**
