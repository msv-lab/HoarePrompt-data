The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length `n` (where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) made up of '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it computes and stores the result of a comparison between the two strings, likely counting the number of positions where the characters differ. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.
