Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 1; `a` and `b` are input strings; `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only impact is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
