Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- The current index `i` satisfies one of the following conditions:
  - `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'`
  - `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'No'`. This output does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. The conditions mentioned in the initial state describe the context in which the code might be running but do not influence the content of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
