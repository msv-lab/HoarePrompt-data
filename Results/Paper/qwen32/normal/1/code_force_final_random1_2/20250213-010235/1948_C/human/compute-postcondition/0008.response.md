Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 1; `a` and `b` are input strings; either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both `<` and `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `<`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
