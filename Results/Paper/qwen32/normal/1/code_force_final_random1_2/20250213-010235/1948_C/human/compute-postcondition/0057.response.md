Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing only '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it checks if there exists any position where the character in one string is '<' and the character in the corresponding or adjacent position in the other string is also '<'. If such a position is found, it outputs 'No'; otherwise, it outputs 'Yes'.**
