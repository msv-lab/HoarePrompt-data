To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are input values.
- `i` is `k + 2`.
- The loop condition checks if `i + 1 < n` and if either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. If this condition is met, the loop breaks; otherwise, no additional changes occur.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2 each iteration until it reaches or exceeds `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the current value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k + 2`.
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the next odd number after `k + 2`.

2. **Adjust `i` for the next iteration:**
   - If `i` was `k + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, then the next value of `i` should be `(k + 2) + 2 = k + 4`.

3. **Check the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < n`.
   - Given that `i` is now `k + 4`, the condition becomes `(k + 4) + 1 < n` or `k + 5 < n`.

4. **No changes to other variables:**
   - The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new value of `i` and maintain the conditions for `n`, `a`, and `b`.

State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input values, `i` is `k + 4`**
