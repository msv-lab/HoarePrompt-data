Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are input values.
- `i` is `k + 4`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k`). It simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'No'`, regardless of the values of the other variables, the output will be:

Output: **No**
