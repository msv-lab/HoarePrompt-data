Postcondition: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input values. If `a[i]` equals `b[i + 1]` and both equal `<` with `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` equals `b[i - 1]` and both equal `<`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues.**
