Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is incremented by 1: This means `t` has been increased by 1 from its previous value, but its exact value is not specified.
- `n` is greater than 1: This indicates that `n` holds a value greater than 1, but its specific value is not provided.
- `a` and `b` are input values: These are values that have been provided as input, but their exact values are not specified.
- `i` is `k + 2`: This means `i` is calculated as the value of `k` plus 2, but neither `i` nor `k` have specific values provided.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`. It does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, or `k`. The string `'No'` is explicitly provided in the print statement.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
