The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `2 ** i` evaluates to 2. Therefore, the list `ans` which was initially `[2, 2]` will now be `[2, 2, 2]`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 2 <= k <= n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 2, and `ans` is a list containing three elements, `[2, 2, 2], `i` is 1**.
