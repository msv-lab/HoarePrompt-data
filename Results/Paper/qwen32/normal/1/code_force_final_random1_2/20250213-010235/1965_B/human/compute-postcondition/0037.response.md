To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
   - `l` is the length of the binary string `b`.
   - The list `ans` is defined based on the value of `k`.

2. **List Definition**:
   - If `k` equals 1, the list `ans` is set to `[2, 3, 4, 8]`.
   - Otherwise, the list `ans` is set to `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns a string formed by joining the elements of the list `ans` with spaces.

Given these conditions, we can derive the output state based on the value of `k`.

### Case 1: When `k` equals 1
- The list `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`.
- The return statement will join these elements into the string `'2 3 4 8'`.

### Case 2: When `k` is not equal to 1
- The list `ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.
- The return statement will join these elements into a string with spaces.

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for `k`, we consider both cases.

#### For `k = 1`:
Output State: **The program returns '2 3 4 8'**

#### For `k != 1`:
- The list `ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.
- The return statement will form a string from this list.

To provide a general output state for `k != 1`:
Output State: **The program returns '2 {k-3} {k+1} {2*k+1} 2'**

However, since the problem asks for a single output state, we'll focus on the case where `k` is not specified but generally follows the pattern for `k != 1`.

Therefore, the final output state considering the general case for `k != 1` is:

Output State: **The program returns '2 {k-3} {k+1} {2*k+1} 2'**
