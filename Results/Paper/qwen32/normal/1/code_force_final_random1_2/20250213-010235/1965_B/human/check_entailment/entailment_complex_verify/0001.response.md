To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and behavior of `func_14()`, which is responsible for generating the sequence `a` based on the inputs `n` and `k`.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Case 1: When `k == 1`
- If `n == 2`, the program returns `[2]`.
  - **Verification:**
    - The sequence `[2]` does not contain any subsequence that sums to `1`.
    - The only possible sum is `2`, which is not required to be formed.
    - Thus, this satisfies the conditions.
- If `n > 2`, the program initializes `ans` with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
  - **Verification:**
    - The sequence starts with `[2, 3]`.
    - Powers of 2 (i.e., 4, 8, 16, ...) are appended.
    - Since `k = 1`, no subsequence can sum to `1`.
    - All sums from `2` to `n` (excluding `1`) can be formed using combinations of these powers of 2 and the numbers `2` and `3`.

#### Case 2: When `k != 1`
- The program initializes `ans` with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
- It appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
- It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to cover additional sums.
- It appends further powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
  - **Verification:**
    - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to `2^(len(bk)-1)`.
    - `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is added to prevent any subsequence from summing to `k`.
    - `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to ensure that sums around `k` are covered.
    - Further powers of 2 are added to ensure that all sums up to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.

### Evaluation Using Annotations:
- **Annotations for `func_14()`:**
  - When `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the output is `'1\n2'`, which is correct.
  - When `k == 1` and `n > 2`, the output includes `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2, ensuring no subsequence sums to `1` and all other sums are covered.
  - When `k != 1`, the output includes powers of 2 up to `2^(len(bk)-1)`, `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and further powers of 2, ensuring no subsequence sums to `k` and all other sums are covered.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the annotations, the program correctly generates sequences that satisfy both conditions for each test case. The logic and implementation seem to handle all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
