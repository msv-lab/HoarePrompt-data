The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. It returns the string '1\n2' if `k` is 1 and `n` is 2. Otherwise, it returns a string formatted as '2 {k-3} {k+1} {2*k+1} 2', where `{k-3}`, `{k+1}`, and `{2*k+1}` are calculated based on the value of `k`.
