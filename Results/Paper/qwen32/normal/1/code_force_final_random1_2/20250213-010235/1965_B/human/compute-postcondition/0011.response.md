The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, `2 ** i` equals 8. Therefore, the list `ans` which was initially `[2, 3, 2]` will now be `[2, 3, 2, 8]`.

Other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is 1, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and is greater than 2, `ans` is [2, 3, 2, 8], `i` is 3**.
