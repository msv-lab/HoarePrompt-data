The given code snippet writes the string representation of the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. This operation does not affect the values of any existing variables in the initial state except for the action of writing to the standard output.

Since no variables are modified or reassigned within the provided code snippet, and the only action is an output operation, the preconditions remain unchanged except for the output action itself.

Output State: **The return value of `func_14()` (converted to a string) followed by a newline character is written to the standard output. `func_10()` must return a value greater than 1.**
