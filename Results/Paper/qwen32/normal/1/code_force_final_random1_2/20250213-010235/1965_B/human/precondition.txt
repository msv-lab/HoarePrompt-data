d is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ d ≤ 1000), processing is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the parameters for each test case, da is an empty list (or any list) that will be used during the processing (its initial content does not matter as it will be modified by the function), and rank is an integer (its value does not matter as it will be used as a counter or index within the function).
