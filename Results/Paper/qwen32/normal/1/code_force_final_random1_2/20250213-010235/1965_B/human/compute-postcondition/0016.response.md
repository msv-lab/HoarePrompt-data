The code snippet assigns the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) to the variable `bk`. This means `bk` will now hold the binary form of `k` as a string.

Given the initial state, `n` and `k` are integers with specific constraints, and `b` is already defined as the binary representation of `n`. The length `l` of the binary string `b` remains unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `bk`, which is the binary representation of `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, and `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.**
