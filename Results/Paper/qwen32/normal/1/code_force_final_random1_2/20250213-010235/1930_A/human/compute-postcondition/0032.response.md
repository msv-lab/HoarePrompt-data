The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `2 * n` with a step of 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 2 (as per the loop's step), making `i` equal to 4. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted because it defines the upper limit of the range, and as long as `2 * n` is greater than the new value of `i`, the loop can continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is `l[0] + l[2]`, `i` is 4**
