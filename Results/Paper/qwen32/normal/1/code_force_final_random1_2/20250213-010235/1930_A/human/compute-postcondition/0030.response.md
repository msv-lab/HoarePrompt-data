To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i`, `n`, and the range parameters.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is at least 1
- `l` is a sorted list of integers
- `score` is `l[0]`
- `i` is 0

In the loop, `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 in each iteration. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it means this was the first iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 2, making it 2. The value of `n` does not change within the loop, and `t`, `l`, and `score` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is `l[0]`, `i` is 2**
