### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's systematically analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have 2n positive integers on a whiteboard.
- We need to perform n moves, each time choosing two integers, adding the smaller one to our score, and erasing both integers.
- Our goal is to maximize the final score.

#### Program Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)
```

#### Annotations Recap:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
- It sorts the list of integers.
- It then iterates over the sorted list, picking every second element starting from index 0, and adds these elements to the score.
- Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

#### Validation Against Problem Requirements:
1. **Sorting the List**:
   - Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are considered first. This is crucial because we want to maximize the score by always adding the smaller element of each pair to the score.

2. **Selecting Elements**:
   - By iterating over the sorted list and picking every second element starting from index 0, we are effectively selecting the smallest element of each pair.
   - For example, in a sorted list `[a1, a2, a3, a4, ...]`, the pairs would be `(a1, a2)`, `(a3, a4)`, etc., and we are adding `a1`, `a3`, etc., to the score.

3. **Maximizing the Score**:
   - Since the list is sorted, the smallest elements are always paired together, ensuring that we are maximizing the sum of the minimums of each pair.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

- **First Test Case**: `n = 1`, List = `[2, 3]`
  - Sorted List: `[2, 3]`
  - Score: `2` (minimum of `[2, 3]`)

- **Second Test Case**: `n = 2`, List = `[1, 1, 2, 1]`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Score: `1 + 1` (minimums of `[1, 1]` and `[1, 2]`)

- **Third Test Case**: `n = 3`, List = `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Score: `1 + 1 + 1` (minimums of `[1, 1]`, `[1, 1]`, and `[1, 1]`)

The program correctly computes the maximum score for each test case as demonstrated by the annotations and the example walkthrough.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers together. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
