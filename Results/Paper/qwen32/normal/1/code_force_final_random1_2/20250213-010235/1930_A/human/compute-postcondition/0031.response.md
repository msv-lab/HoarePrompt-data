Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is `l[0] + l[2]`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `score` is updated to be the sum of its previous value (`l[0]`) and the value at index `i` in the list `l` (`l[2]`). The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.
