To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over a range starting from 0 to `2 * n` with a step of 2.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2 * (n - 1)`.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input.
- `score` is `l[2 * (n - 1)]`.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 2 (as per the loop's step). Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `2 * (n - 1) + 2`, which simplifies to `2 * n`.

Since `n` does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 2 * n**
