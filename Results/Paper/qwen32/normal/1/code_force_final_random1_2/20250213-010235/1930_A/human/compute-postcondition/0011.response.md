To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code step-by-step:

1. **Variable Definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it's part of the initial state).
   - `n`: An input integer.
   - `l`: A sorted list of integers derived from the input.
   - `score`: The sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2(n-1) from `l`.
   - `i`: Set to 2*(n-1).

2. **Relevant Calculation:**
   - `score` is computed as the sum of elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2(n-1)) from the sorted list `l`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a single print statement: `print(score)`.
   - This will output the value of `score`.

4. **Description of `score`:**
   - Since `l` is a sorted list and `score` is the sum of elements at even indices, we can describe `score` as the sum of every other element starting from the first element of the sorted list `l`.

Given this information, the output of the print statement will be the sum of elements at even indices from the sorted list `l`.

Output: **score (where score is the sum of elements at even indices from the sorted list `l`)**
