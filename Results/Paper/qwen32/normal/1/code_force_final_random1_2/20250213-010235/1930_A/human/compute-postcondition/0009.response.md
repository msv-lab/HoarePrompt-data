The code snippet `score += l[i]` increments the `score` by the value at index `i` in the list `l`. Given that `i` is 4, `score` is updated to `score + l[4]`.

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is `l[0] + l[2]`, `i` is 4.

After executing the code:
- `score` is now `l[0] + l[2] + l[4]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is `l[0] + l[2] + l[4]`, `i` is 4.**
