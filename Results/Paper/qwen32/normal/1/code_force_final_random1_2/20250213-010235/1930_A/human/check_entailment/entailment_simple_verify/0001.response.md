### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy involves sorting the list and then summing the elements at even indices, as these elements represent the minimum values of each pair when the list is sorted.

Let's break down the program and validate it using the annotated code:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - **Annotation**: The input is correctly read and processed for each test case.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
   - **Annotation**: The list `l` is sorted, ensuring that the smallest elements come first.

3. **Pairing and Scoring**: The program iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, ...). These elements represent the minimum values of each pair when the list is sorted.
   - **Annotation**: The loop correctly iterates over the sorted list, picking elements at even indices, which are indeed the minimums of each pair in the sorted list.

4. **Summing Scores**: It adds these selected elements to the score.
   - **Annotation**: The score is correctly accumulated by adding the elements at even indices.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the score for each test case.
   - **Annotation**: The score for each test case is printed correctly.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

- **First Test Case**: `n = 1`, List = `[2, 3]`
  - Sorted List: `[2, 3]`
  - Score: `2` (minimum of `[2, 3]`)
  - **Annotation**: The sorted list is `[2, 3]`, and the element at index 0 is `2`, which is the correct score.

- **Second Test Case**: `n = 2`, List = `[1, 1, 2, 1]`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Score: `1 + 1` (minimums of `[1, 1]` and `[1, 2]`)
  - **Annotation**: The sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 2]`, and the elements at indices 0 and 2 are `1` and `1`, respectively, summing to `2`, which is the correct score.

- **Third Test Case**: `n = 3`, List = `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Score: `1 + 1 + 1` (minimums of `[1, 1]`, `[1, 1]`, and `[1, 1]`)
  - **Annotation**: The sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, and the elements at indices 0, 2, and 4 are all `1`, summing to `3`, which is the correct score.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers together. The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected for each step of the process.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
