To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and accumulates the `score`. The loop iterates over the list `l` with a step size of 2, starting from index 0, and adds every second element to the `score`.

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `score` is `l[0]`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 2`), `score` is `l[0] + l[2]`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 4`), `score` is `l[0] + l[2] + l[4]`.

This indicates that after `k` iterations, `score` is the sum of the first `k` elements at even indices in the list `l`.

The loop runs for `n` iterations because the range function `range(0, 2 * n, 2)` generates `n` values (0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(n-1)). Therefore, after all iterations, `score` will be the sum of the first `n` elements at even indices in the list `l`.

Thus, the final `score` will be `l[0] + l[2] + l[4] + ... + l[2*(n-1)]`.

The variable `i` will be the last value generated by the range function, which is `2 * (n - 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is the sum of the first `n` elements at even indices in `l`, `i` is `2 * (n - 1)`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `score` will be the sum of elements at positions 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the (2*n-2)-th position in the list `l`, and `i` will be the last index used in the loop, which is `2 * (n - 1)`.
