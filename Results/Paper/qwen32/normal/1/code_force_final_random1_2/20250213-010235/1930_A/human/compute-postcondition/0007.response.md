The code snippet `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `score` is updated to be the sum of its original value (`l[0]`) and `l[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is `l[0] + l[2]`, `i` is 2**.

In simpler terms, `score` now holds the value of the first element of the list `l` plus the third element of the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
