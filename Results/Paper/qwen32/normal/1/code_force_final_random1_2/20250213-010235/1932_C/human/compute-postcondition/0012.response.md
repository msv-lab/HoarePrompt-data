The code snippet appends the element at index `l` from the list `a` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation, we assume `l` is intended to be `i` (since `l` is not defined in the initial state, but the operation suggests an index increment).

Since `i` was incremented by 1, and assuming `i` started at 0, `i` would now be 1. Therefore, the element at index 1 of the list `a` is appended to `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `i` is 1; `b` contains the element `a[1]`.**
