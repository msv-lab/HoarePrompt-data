The given code snippet decrements the variable `r` by 1. No other variables are modified directly by this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'
- `i` is incremented by 1 (implying `i` was previously defined and now holds its previous value plus 1)
- `b` has an additional element `a[r]` appended to it (implying `b` was previously defined and now holds its previous elements plus `a[r]`)
- `r` is decremented by 1 (implying `r` was previously defined and now holds its previous value minus 1)

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `i` is incremented by 1; `b` has an additional element `a[r+1]` appended to it; `r` is decreased by 1.**
