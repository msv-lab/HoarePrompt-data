The code snippet provided is `b.append(a[l])`. This line appends the element at index `l` of list `a` to the list `b`. However, the variable `l` is not defined in the initial state provided. Assuming there was a mistake and `l` should be `i` (as `i` is defined as 4), the element at index 4 of list `a` will be appended to list `b`.

Given that `i` is 4, the element at index 4 of list `a` (which is `a[4]`) will be added to list `b`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `a` or `b`, we can only say that `b` now contains the element `a[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `i` is 4; `b` contains the element `a[4]`.**
