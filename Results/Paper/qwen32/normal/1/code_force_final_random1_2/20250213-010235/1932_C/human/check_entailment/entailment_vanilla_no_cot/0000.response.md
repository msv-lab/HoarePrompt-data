Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the product of the remaining elements of the array after each command. Here's why:

1. The program maintains two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array that have not been removed yet.
2. It then constructs a list `b` by appending the elements that would be removed according to the commands ('L' or 'R').
3. However, the product calculation is done on this list `b`, which contains the elements in the reverse order of their removal, not the remaining elements of the array.
4. As a result, the product is calculated over the wrong set of elements, leading to incorrect remainders.

To fix the program, you should calculate the product of the remaining elements of the array after each command, not the elements that have been removed. This can be efficiently done using prefix and suffix products, taking care to update the product only over the elements that are still present in the array after each removal.
