Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, where each element of `ans` is the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, taken modulo `m`. The code returns this list in reverse order, meaning the last element of `ans` becomes the first element of the returned list, and so on.
