The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the element at index `r` from the list `a` to the list `b`. However, the variable `r` is not defined in the given initial state. Assuming `r` is a valid index within the range of `a` (i.e., 0 ≤ r < n), the element `a[r]` will be appended to `b`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `b`, which gains a new element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `i` is 4; `b` contains the element `a[r]` appended to it.**
