The code appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to list `b`. Given that `r` is initialized to `n - 1`, the element appended to `b` is `a[n - 1]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `m` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.
- `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
- `b` now contains one element, which is `a[n - 1]`.
- `l` remains 0.
- `r` remains `n - 1`.
- `s[i]` is not 'L' (this condition applies to the original string `s` and does not change).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing the single element `a[n - 1]`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `s[i]` is not 'L'.**
