The given code snippet `p = p * v % m` modifies the value of `p`. However, the variable `v` is not defined in the initial state. Since `v` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact new value of `p`. Assuming `v` is a known integer, the new value of `p` would be `(p * v) % m`.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the updated state will reflect the new value of `p` while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 and `n` is at least 1; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s` and `b` has at least one element; `l` is `n`; `r` is `-1`; `ans` is an empty list; `p` is `(p * v) % m`**.
