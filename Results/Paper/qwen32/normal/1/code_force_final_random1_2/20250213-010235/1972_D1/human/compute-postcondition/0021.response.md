Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d` such that `d[da]` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `processing` is a list of integers where `processing[di - 1]` is 0 for all `di` in `d[da]` that were processed, `rank` is a list of integers, and `rank[da - 1]` is `tmp + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `rank[da - 1]` has been updated to `tmp + 1`. All other variables retain their original states and constraints.
