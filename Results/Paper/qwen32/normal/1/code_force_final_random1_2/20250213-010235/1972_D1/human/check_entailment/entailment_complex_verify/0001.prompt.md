You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` prints a positive integer from `func_15()` a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to carefully analyze the code and see if it implements the logic required by the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Code Analysis
Let's examine the provided functions to see if they address the problem:

- **func_1 to func_11**: These functions are utility functions for reading input and output. They do not contain any logic related to solving the problem.
- **func_12 to func_14**: These functions seem to be unrelated to the problem. They appear to be solving a different problem involving graphs or some other data structure.
- **func_15**: This function seems to be attempting to solve the problem. Let's analyze its logic.
- **func_16**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, which suggests that `func_15` should be the main logic for solving the problem.

#### Analysis of `func_15`
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```
This function calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) using a loop and a condition that involves the square root of `n + i`. However, the logic does not directly match the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness Check
The provided solution does not seem to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, it does not account for the gcd condition properly.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
