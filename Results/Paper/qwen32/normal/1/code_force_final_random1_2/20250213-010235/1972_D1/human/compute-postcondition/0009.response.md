To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `i * i <= n + i`.

Given the current state:
- `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, which are positive integers and `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` is 3.
- `ans` is `(n + 1) + (n + 2) // 4`.

Let's analyze the condition `i * i <= n + i` with the current value of `i` (which is 3):
- `i * i = 3 * 3 = 9`
- The condition becomes `9 <= n + 3`, which simplifies to `6 <= n`.

Since `n` must be at least 2, the condition `6 <= n` ensures that the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, no adjustment to `i` is necessary because the condition already holds true for `i = 3` if `n` is at least 6.

Thus, the state does not need to be modified further to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, which are positive integers and `n` must be at least 6; `i` is 3; `ans` is `(n + 1) + (n + 2) // 4`**
