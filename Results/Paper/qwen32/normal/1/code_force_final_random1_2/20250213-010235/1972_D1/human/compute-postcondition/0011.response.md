The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 3, so now `i` is 4. The values of `n`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, which are positive integers and `n` must be at least 6; `i` is 4; `ans` is `(n + 1) + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`.**
