The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple containing three values. If `b` is zero, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes and returns values based on the extended Euclidean algorithm, which are typically used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` along with BÃ©zout coefficients.
