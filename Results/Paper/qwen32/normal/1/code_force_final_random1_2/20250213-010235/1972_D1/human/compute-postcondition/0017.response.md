Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d` such that `d[da]` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `processing` is a list of integers where `processing[di - 1]` is now 1, `rank` is a list of integers, and `tmp` is the minimum of its current value and the value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. `di` is `di_next`, the next element in `d[da]` after the current `di`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `tmp` has been updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value returned by the function `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
