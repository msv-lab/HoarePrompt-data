The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable, and the function call `func_10()`. Since the underscore does not hold any state, we only need to consider the return value of `func_10()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` would have returned a value that decremented the number of iterations left. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value that is still greater than zero.

Given that `n` and `m` are positive integers and `func_15()` has been called and returned a value, we need to assume that `func_10()`'s return value is dependent on some state or calculation involving `n` and `m`, but since we don't have the definition of `func_10()`, we can only infer based on typical loop behavior.

If `func_10()` returns a value that represents the number of iterations left, then for the loop to continue, `func_10()` should return a value greater than 0.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and a positive integer from `func_15()` has been returned and printed, and `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0**
