### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Recap
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Code Analysis
The code includes several utility functions for input and output, which are not relevant to the core logic. The main logic resides in `func_15`, which is called for each test case by `func_16`.

##### Function `func_15`
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

Let's break down the logic:
- The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`.
- It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
- It iterates while \(i \times i \leq n + i\).
- In each iteration, it adds \((n + i) // (i \times i)\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

This logic does not seem to directly address the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it appears to be counting something else entirely.

#### Verification Using Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at various points, but they do not provide insight into why the logic in `func_15` is incorrect. The annotations only confirm that the input is being read correctly and that `func_15` is being called for each test case.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        m = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation correctly counts the number of valid pairs by iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. The logic in `func_15` does not account for the gcd condition properly.

**Final: False**
