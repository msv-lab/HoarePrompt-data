To determine the output state, let's first identify the initial conditions and then apply the given operation.

Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, which are positive integers, and `n` must be at least 6.
- `i` is 3.
- `ans` is calculated as `(n + 1) + (n + 2) // 4`.

Now, we need to compute the new value of `ans` using the operation `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)`.

Given `i` is 3, the operation becomes:
`ans += (n + 3) // (3 * 3)`
`ans += (n + 3) // 9`

Let's denote the new value of `ans` as `ans_new`. Thus,
`ans_new = ans + (n + 3) // 9`

Since `ans` was initially `(n + 1) + (n + 2) // 4`, we substitute this into our equation:
`ans_new = (n + 1) + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is `(n + 1) + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, which are positive integers and `n` must be at least 6; `i` is 3; `ans` is `(n + 1) + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`.**
