### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the provided program does not correctly solve the problem because the core function `func_15` does not accurately reflect the logic needed to determine the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` satisfying the conditions `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The assessment provides a corrected version of the function that iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition directly.

Let's analyze the annotated version of the provided program to verify this assessment:

1. **Function `func_15`:**
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7()`.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`.
   - Inside the loop, it increments `ans` by `(n + i) // (i * i)` and increments `i`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

2. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` do not directly correspond to checking the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The provided logic in `func_15` appears to be an attempt to optimize the counting process, possibly by leveraging some mathematical property, but it does not match the problem's requirements.

3. **Comparison with Corrected Version:**
   - The corrected version explicitly iterates over all pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and checks the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - This brute-force approach ensures correctness but may not be optimal in terms of performance for large inputs.

4. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations describe the state of the program at various points, confirming that `func_15` is indeed calculating something related to divisors and sums but not the specific condition required by the problem.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. The function `func_15` does not accurately check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for all pairs `(a, b)`.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
