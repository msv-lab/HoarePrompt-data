Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The core function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` satisfying the conditions `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the implementation in `func_15` does not accurately reflect this logic.

Let's break down the issue:

1. **Logic Mismatch**: The function `func_15` calculates something related to divisors and sums but does not directly address the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop `while i * i <= n + i:` and the calculation inside the loop do not align with the problem's requirement. Specifically, the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not correctly check for the condition involving `gcd`.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:
- Input: `n = 2`, `m = 3`
- Expected Output: `3` (pairs are `(1,1)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`)

However, the function `func_15` will not produce the correct result for this input because it does not properly iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here is a corrected version of the function that would satisfy the problem description:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the required condition, ensuring correctness for all inputs within the constraints. Since the original program does not do this, it is incorrect.
