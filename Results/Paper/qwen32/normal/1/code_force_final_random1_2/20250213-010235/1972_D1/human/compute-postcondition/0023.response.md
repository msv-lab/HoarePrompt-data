Functionality: **The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d` which is a dictionary with integer keys and list-of-integer values, `processing` which is a list of integers (either 0 or 1), `da` which is an integer key present in the dictionary `d`, and `rank` which is a list of integers. The function returns 1 in Case_1; otherwise, it returns `tmp + 1` in Case_2.**
