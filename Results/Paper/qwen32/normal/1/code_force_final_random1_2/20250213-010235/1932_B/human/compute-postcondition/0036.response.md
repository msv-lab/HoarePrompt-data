In the given initial state, it is mentioned that "the sum of all elements in the list `a`" is computed, but this sum is not assigned to any variable or used in the provided code snippet. The code snippet only contains a `print(year)` statement.

Given that there is no variable named `year` defined in the initial state or in the provided code snippet, it's clear that the variable `year` does not have an explicit value. Therefore, attempting to execute `print(year)` would result in a `NameError` because `year` is undefined.

However, since the task requires us to determine what will be printed based on the provided information, and since `year` is not defined, we cannot provide a specific value to be printed. Instead, we should indicate that the variable is undefined.

Output: **NameError: name 'year' is not defined**
