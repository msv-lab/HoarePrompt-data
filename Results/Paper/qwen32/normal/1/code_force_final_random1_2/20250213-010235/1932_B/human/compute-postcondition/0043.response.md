To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `current_year` variable based on the elements in the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element `ai` in `a` and adjusts `current_year` to be the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the current value of `current_year`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `current_year` starts at 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `ai` in `a`:
     - If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, `next_year` is set to the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
     - `current_year` is updated to `next_year`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After processing all elements in `a`, `current_year` will be the smallest number that is a multiple of every element in `a`. This number is known as the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`.

Given that the `results` list contains the LCM of all elements in `a`, the final value of `current_year` after all iterations will be equal to this LCM.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` remains a list of tuples where the first two tuples have non-empty lists as their second elements.
- `results` remains a list containing one element which is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`.
- `test` remains the second tuple in `test_cases`.
- `n` remains the first element of `test`.
- `a` remains the second element of `test` and is a non-empty list.
- `current_year` is equal to the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`.

Output State: **`current_year` is equal to the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`.**
