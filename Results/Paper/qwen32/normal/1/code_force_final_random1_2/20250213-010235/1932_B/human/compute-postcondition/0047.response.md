The code snippet sets `current_year` to 0. This changes the value of `current_year` from its initial state, which was the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`. All other variables (`results`, `test`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_year` is 0; `results` now includes the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last element; `test` is the next element in `test_cases`; `n` is the first element of `test`; `a` is the second element of `test`.**
