Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `results` is a list containing the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a` for each test case in `test_cases`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `results` will contain the LCM of the integers in the list `a` for every test case provided in `test_cases`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `test_cases` also remains unchanged.
