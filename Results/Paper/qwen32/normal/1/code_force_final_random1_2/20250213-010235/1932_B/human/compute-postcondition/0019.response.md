To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over each element in the list `a` using the variable `ai`.

Here's the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `year` is the first element of the list `a`.
- `t` is decreased by 1 (though `t` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need adjustment).
- `n` is the input integer from the user (also not part of the loop head and thus does not need adjustment).
- `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element.

The loop statement is:
```python
for ai in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since the loop iterates over each element in the list `a` using `ai`, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in the list `a` being assigned to `ai`.

Given that `year` was the first element of the list `a` at the end of the previous iteration, `ai` at the start of the next iteration should be the second element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`year` is the first element of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least two elements, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`**

Note that `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
