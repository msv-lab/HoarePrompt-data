Postcondition: **`current_year` is updated to `next_year`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` is updated to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is updated to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. `results` includes the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last element. `test` is the next element in `test_cases` and has at least two elements where the second element (`a`) is a non-empty list. `n` is the first element of `test`. `a` is the second element of `test` and has at least one element. `ai` is the next element in `a`.**
