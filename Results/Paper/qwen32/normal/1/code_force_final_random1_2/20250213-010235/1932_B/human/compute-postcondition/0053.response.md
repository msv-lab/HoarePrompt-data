Postcondition: **`current_year` is 0, `results` includes the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases` and has at least two elements where the second element (`a`) is a non-empty list, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and has at least one element. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is set to `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to `a[0]`.**
