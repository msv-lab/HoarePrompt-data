The only variable in the loop head is `test`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more elements in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `current_year` is equal to the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, and `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `test_cases` that `test` can take on.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `test` is now the next element in `test_cases`.

State: **`current_year` is equal to the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`; `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element; `test` is the next element in `test_cases`**
