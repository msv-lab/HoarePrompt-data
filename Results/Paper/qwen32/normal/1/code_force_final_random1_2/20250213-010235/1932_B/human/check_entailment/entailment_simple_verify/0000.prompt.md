You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- There are `n` signs of the apocalypse, each occurring periodically every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only start occurring after the previous one has occurred.
- We need to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, thus marking the end of the apocalypse.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads the number of signs `n`.
2. It reads the list of periodicities `a`.
3. It initializes `year` to 0.
4. For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.

### Explanation of the Logic:
- `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If this remainder is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence of the sign would be at `year + ai`.
- If `year % ai` is not 0, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence of the sign would be at the next multiple of `ai` after `year`, which is `year + (ai - year % ai)`.
- The expression `year % ai or ai` effectively computes the smallest increment needed to make `year` a multiple of `ai`:
  - If `year % ai` is 0, it evaluates to `ai`.
  - If `year % ai` is not 0, it evaluates to `year % ai`, but since we need the next multiple, we actually need `ai - (year % ai)`. However, the expression `year % ai or ai` simplifies to `ai` when `year % ai` is 0, which is equivalent to adding `ai` to `year` directly in that case.
  - Therefore, `year += year % ai or ai` correctly increments `year` to the next multiple of `ai`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs:

#### Example Input:
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

#### Expected Output:
```
36
5
5
2012
```

#### Program Output:
Running the program with the above input produces the expected output.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic and testing the program with the provided examples, it appears that the program correctly calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs for each test case. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to produce the correct result based on the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
