Output State: **`current_year` is `next_year`; `next_year` is `current_year` + `ai`; `results` includes the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last element; `test` is the next element in `test_cases` and has at least two elements where the second element (`a`) is a non-empty list; `n` is the first element of `test`; `a` is the second element of `test` and has at least one element; `ai` is the next element in `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `next_year` is updated to be the sum of `current_year` and `ai`. All other variables retain their initial values.
