The code snippet takes a list of integers from the input, processes each integer by subtracting its remainder when divided by 2 (effectively making each integer even), and assigns the resulting list to the variable `p`.

Given the initial state where \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) are non-negative integers and \( t \) (number of test cases) is greater than 0, the code modifies \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) to their nearest even values.

Output State: **Each of \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) is now the nearest even integer less than or equal to its original value; \( t \) is greater than 0.**
