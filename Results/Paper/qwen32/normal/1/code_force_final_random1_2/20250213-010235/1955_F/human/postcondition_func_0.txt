The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on these counts. Specifically, it checks if exactly three of the first three counts are odd and adds this boolean condition (1 for true, 0 for false) to half the sum of all four counts rounded down to the nearest even number.
