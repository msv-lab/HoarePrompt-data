Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new output state.

Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1`.
- `x` is `a[2]`.
- `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(a[0] / 2)`.

Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
```

Impact of the code:
- `x` is equal to `a[2]`, and since `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]`, `x` is also equal to `a[0]`.
- `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)`, which is equivalent to `math.floor(a[0] / 2)`.

Since `a[0]` is an odd integer (as `a[0] % 2 == 1`), `math.floor(a[0] / 2)` is equivalent to `(a[0] - 1) / 2`.

Initially, `cnt` was incremented by `math.floor(a[0] / 2)`, so the total increment to `cnt` is `2 * math.floor(a[0] / 2)`, which simplifies to `a[0] - 1`.

Therefore, the updated value of `cnt` is `a[0] - 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1`; `x` is `a[2]`; `cnt` is `a[0] - 1`.**
