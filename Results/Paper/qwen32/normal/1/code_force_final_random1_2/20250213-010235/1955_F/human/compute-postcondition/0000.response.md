In this task, we need to ensure that the for loop will execute based on the given loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the value inside the `range()` function is greater than 0. This value is derived from `int(input())`, meaning the input to the program should be a positive integer.

Given the state before the loop starts includes four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \), these values do not directly affect the execution of the loop. However, they might be related to the input that the program expects.

Since the loop will execute based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is a positive integer. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the input to the program is a positive integer.

State: **Each test case consists of four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) (where \( 0 \leq p_i \leq 200 \)), and the input to the program must be a positive integer.**

However, since the problem specifies that there are multiple test cases and the loop iterates over the number of test cases, the input to the program (which determines the number of iterations) should be set to the number of test cases \( t \), and \( t \) must be greater than 0.

So, the final state should reflect that the number of test cases \( t \) is a positive integer.

State: **Each test case consists of four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) (where \( 0 \leq p_i \leq 200 \)), and the number of test cases \( t \) must be greater than 0.**
