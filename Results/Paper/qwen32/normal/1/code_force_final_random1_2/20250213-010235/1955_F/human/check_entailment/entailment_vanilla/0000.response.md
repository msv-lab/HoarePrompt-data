Let's analyze the problem and the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
2. **Winning Condition**: Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
3. **Game Dynamics**: Eve removes one number at a time, reducing the sequence size by one each turn, until the sequence is empty.
4. **Key Insight**: 
   - XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if each bit position has an even number of 1s.
   - Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 have binary representations: `1`, `10`, `11`, and `100` respectively.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to leave sequences where the XOR is zero.

### Observations:

- For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero.
- If there are an odd number of 1s, 3s, or both, the XOR will be non-zero unless they are paired up.
- If there are an even number of 1s and 3s, and also an even number of 2s and 4s, the XOR will be zero.

### Strategy:

- If there are three odd counts among the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s, Bob can win exactly once (when no numbers are removed).
- Otherwise, Bob can win every other turn by ensuring that the remaining numbers have an even count of 1s and 3s.
- The total number of turns is equal to the total number of numbers, which is `p1 + p2 + p3 + p4`.
- Therefore, Bob can win `total_numbers // 2` times if he wins every other turn.

### Program Analysis:

Let's break down the given program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
2. **Transformation**: It transforms the counts by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2 (`int(x) - int(x) % 2`). This effectively makes all counts even, which is not useful for determining the parity of the counts.
3. **Odd Count Check**: It checks if there are exactly three odd counts among the first three counts (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`). If true, it adds 1 to the result.
4. **Total Wins Calculation**: It calculates the total number of wins as `sum(p) // 2`, which is the total number of numbers divided by 2.
5. **Output**: It prints the sum of the two values calculated above.

### Issues in the Program:

- The transformation step (`int(x) - int(x) % 2`) is incorrect and does not help in determining the parity of the counts.
- The check for exactly three odd counts among the first three counts is incorrect because it ignores the count of 4s, which can affect the XOR result.
- The logic for calculating the maximum number of times Bob can win is flawed.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
