Functionality: **The function accepts four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence respectively. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of these four integers. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the counts provided.**
