In the given task, the initial state only mentions `final_cnt`, but the print statement is trying to print `cnt`. Since `cnt` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, it's unclear what the value of `cnt` is based on the provided information. 

However, if we assume that there might have been a typo and the intention was to print `final_cnt` instead of `cnt`, then we can proceed with that assumption.

Given that `final_cnt` is the only variable mentioned in the initial state, we will assume that `cnt` is actually `final_cnt`.

Thus, the output would be the value of `final_cnt`.

Output: **final_cnt (where final_cnt is the value of the variable final_cnt)**

If `cnt` is indeed a different variable and its value is not provided, then we cannot determine what will be printed. But based on the available information and the assumption, the output is as described above.
