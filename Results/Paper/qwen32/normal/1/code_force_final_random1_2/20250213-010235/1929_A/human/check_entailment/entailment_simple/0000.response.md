### Reasoning:

To determine the maximum beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The formula for the beauty of the array is:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

when the array is sorted in ascending order. This is because all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving only the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

Let's verify this with the annotated program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array elements (`a`).
3. It sorts the array in ascending order.
4. It calculates the beauty as the difference between the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the sorted array.
5. It prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

Given the logic above, the program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic explained.
