### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after potentially rearranging the array. The key insight is that the beauty of the array simplifies to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array when the array is sorted in ascending order.

The provided program correctly follows this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
3. It sorts the array.
4. It calculates the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.
5. It prints this difference as the result.

The function summary accurately describes what the function does: it reads multiple test cases, sorts the array for each test case, and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array. This aligns with the problem's requirement to find the maximum beauty of the array.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program implements the optimal solution by sorting the array and computing the difference between the largest and smallest elements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
