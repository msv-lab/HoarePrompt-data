### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly analyzes the problem and the provided solution. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which simplifies to \(a_n - a_1\) after cancellation of intermediate terms.
   - To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize \(a_n\) (the largest element) and minimize \(a_1\) (the smallest element).

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array, which arranges the elements in ascending order.
   - It calculates the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array, which corresponds to \(a_n - a_1\).
   - It prints this difference as the result.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points:
     - Before the function call, `t` is the number of test cases.
     - For each test case, `n` is the length of the array, and `a` is the list of array elements.
     - After sorting, `a` is in ascending order.
     - The program correctly computes and prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and computing the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the analysis and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly solves the problem as per the provided logic and constraints.

Final: **True**
