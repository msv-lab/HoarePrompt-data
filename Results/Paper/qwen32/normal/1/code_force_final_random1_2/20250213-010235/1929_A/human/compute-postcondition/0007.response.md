Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` must be greater than 0; `itest` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; for each test case, `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `n` is now the integer value read from the input.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` has been updated to the integer read from the input, while the values of `t`, `ntest`, and `itest` remain unchanged. The list `a` and its properties are still as described in the initial state.
