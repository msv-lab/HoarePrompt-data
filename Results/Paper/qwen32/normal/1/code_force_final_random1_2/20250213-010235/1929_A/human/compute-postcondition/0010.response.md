To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. This represents the number of test cases.
- `ntest` is greater than 0, indicating there is at least one test case.
- `itest` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, suggesting it keeps track of the current test case number.
- `n` is the integer value read from the input, representing the number of integers in the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers read from the input.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Explanation:
- `a[len(a) - 1]` refers to the last element of the sorted list `a`.
- `a[0]` refers to the first element of the sorted list `a`.
- Since `a` is a sorted list, `a[0]` is the smallest element, and `a[len(a) - 1]` is the largest element.
- Therefore, `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

### Output:
Given the initial state, the output of the `print` statement will be the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`**
