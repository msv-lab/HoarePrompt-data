The value of `ql` is updated by subtracting the element at index `s - 1` in the list `a` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0; `m` is 0; `i` is 1; `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`; `s` is an integer between 0 and the length of `a`; the element at index `s` in `a` is equal to the previous value of `ql`; `l` is 0.**
