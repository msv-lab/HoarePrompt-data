To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the operations performed on the variables.

### Initial State and Operations:

1. **Variable `q`:** 
   - It is given that `q > 0`.

2. **Variable `m`:**
   - `m` is updated using the formula: `m = m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
   - This means `m` is initially some value (not specified), and it gets updated based on the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`.

3. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is set to 1. However, `i` does not seem to be used in the calculation of `m` or in the print statement.

4. **Variable `ql`:**
   - `ql` is updated using the formula: `ql = ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - This means `ql` is initially some value (not specified), and it gets updated based on the value of `a[s - 1]`.

5. **Variable `s`:**
   - `s` is an integer between 0 and the length of `a`.
   - The element at index `s` in `a` is set to the previous value of `ql`.

6. **Variable `l`:**
   - `l` is set to 1. Similar to `i`, `l` does not seem to be used in the calculation of `m` or in the print statement.

7. **Condition:**
   - If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
   - This condition ensures that the value of `ql` is correctly set at index `s` in the list `a`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:

- The print statement is `print(int(m), end=' ')`.
- This means the integer part of `m` will be printed, followed by a space, without moving to a new line.

### Determining the Value of `m`:

- Since the initial value of `m` is not specified, we can only describe `m` in terms of the operations performed on it.
- The value of `m` is updated by adding `b[s - 1]` and the result of `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` to its current value.
- Therefore, the final value of `m` depends on the initial value of `m`, the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`.

### Conclusion:

Given the information provided, the precise value of `m` cannot be determined without knowing its initial value and the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`. However, we can describe the printed output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int(m) (where m is updated as m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
