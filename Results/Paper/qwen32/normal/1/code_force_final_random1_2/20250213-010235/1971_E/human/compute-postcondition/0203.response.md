Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, a list `a` of `k` distinct integers in increasing order ending at `n`, and a list `b` of `k` distinct integers in increasing order. It also receives `q` queries, each being an integer `d` such that 0 ≤ d ≤ n. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each query based on the provided lists `a` and `b`.**
