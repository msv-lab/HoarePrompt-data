Output State: **`v` is `[0, ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i]]`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `q` is the third integer from the input, `l` is the previous value of `q` before the new assignment, `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by at least one more integer from the input, `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by integers from the new input, `ad` is a list containing `0` and the differences `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing `0` and the differences `b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`, `i` is `i + 2` where `i + 2 < len(a)`**

Explanation: The list `v` originally contained three elements: `0`, `ad[i] / bd[i]`, and `ad[i] / bd[i]`. After executing the line `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])`, another element `ad[i] / bd[i]` is added to the end of the list `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
