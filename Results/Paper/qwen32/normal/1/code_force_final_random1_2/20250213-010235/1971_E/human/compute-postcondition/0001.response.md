In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable here is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't intend to use inside the loop. Since the loop variable `_` doesn't affect the execution of the loop, the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is already in a valid state for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself.

However, since the question asks us to specify the state ensuring the loop executes, we can confirm that `t` should be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This state ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
