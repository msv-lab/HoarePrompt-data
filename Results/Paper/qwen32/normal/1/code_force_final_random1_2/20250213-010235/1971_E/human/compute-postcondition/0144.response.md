The given code snippet appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. 

Given the initial state:
- `l` is `q-1`
- `i` is 2
- `m` is the sum of all calculated `m` values from each iteration
- `ql` is the value read in the last iteration
- `s` is the index found in the last iteration
- `q` is the newly input integer
- `t` is `t-1`
- `n` is the first input integer
- `k` is the second input integer
- `a` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`
- `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`
- `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0]]`
- `bd` is `[0]`

After executing the line `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])`, the list `ad` will have one more element, which is the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.

Since `i` is 2, the new element appended to `ad` will be `a[2] - a[1]`.

Therefore, the updated `ad` list will be `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1]]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is `q-1`, `i` is 2, `m` is the sum of all calculated `m` values from each iteration, `ql` is the value read in the last iteration, `s` is the index found in the last iteration, `q` is the newly input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1]]`, `bd` is `[0]`**.
