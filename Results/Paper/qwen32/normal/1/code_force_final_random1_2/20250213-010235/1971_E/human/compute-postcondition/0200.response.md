To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables over time. The loop iterates `q` times, and during each iteration, it updates the value of `m` based on the newly input integer `ql` and its position within the list `a`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the variables evolve:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `l` starts at `q-1` and decrements with each iteration.
   - `i` is initialized to `len(a)` but remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `m` accumulates the calculated values across all iterations.
   - `ql` is updated with each new input integer.
   - `s` is the index found using `bisect_left` for the current `ql`.
   - `q` is the total number of iterations.
   - `t` is decremented by 1 with each iteration.
   - `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, `l` decreases by 1 until it reaches 0.
   - `m` is recalculated and accumulated based on the formula provided.
   - `ql` is adjusted by subtracting `a[s - 1]` from it.
   - `s` is recalculated using `bisect_left` for the new `ql`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After `q` iterations, `l` will be `-1`.
   - `i` remains `len(a)`.
   - `m` will be the sum of all calculated `m` values from each iteration.
   - `ql` will be the value read in the last iteration.
   - `s` will be the index found in the last iteration.
   - `q` remains the same as the initial input.
   - `t` will be `t-q` since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`l` is `-1`, `i` is `len(a)`, `m` is the sum of all calculated `m` values from each iteration, `ql` is the value read in the last iteration, `s` is the index found in the last iteration, `q` is the newly input integer, `t` is `t-q`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `l` becomes `-1`, `m` holds the accumulated sum from each iteration, `ql` and `s` reflect the last input and its position, `t` is reduced by the number of iterations, and all other variables remain as initially defined.
