The only variable in the loop head is `l`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l` and `q`. If `l` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 0, and `q` is the newly input integer. Since `l` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `l` should be 1.

However, since the question specifies the state at the end of the previous iteration as `l` is 0, and asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, we simply increment `l` by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`l` is 1, `i` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`, `ql` is the newly input integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where the newly input integer would fit in the sorted list `a`, `q` is the newly input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`**.
