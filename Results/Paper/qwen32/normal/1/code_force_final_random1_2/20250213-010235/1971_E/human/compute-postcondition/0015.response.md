The given code snippet appends the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Since the initial state specifies that `bd` starts with a single element `0`, and the code does not specify the value of `i`, we assume `i` is a valid index for the list `b`.

Given the initial state, `bd` initially contains `[0]`. After executing the line `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])`, `bd` will contain two elements: the initial `0` and the new element `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is `0` and `a[1:]` contains the integers read from the input; `b` is a list with at least two elements where `b[0]` is `0` and `b[1]` is an integer; `ad` is a list containing `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`; `bd` is a list containing `[0, b[i] - b[i - 1]]`**.
