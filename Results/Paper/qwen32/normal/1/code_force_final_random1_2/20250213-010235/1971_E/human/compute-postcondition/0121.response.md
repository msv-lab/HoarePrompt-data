The only variable in the loop head is `l`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `q`. If `l` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 0, and `q` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`q` is greater than 0; `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`; `i` is 1; `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`; `s` is an integer between 0 and the length of `a`; the element at index `s` in `a` is equal to the previous value of `ql`; `l` is 1**
