The code snippet `ql -= a[s - 1]` subtracts the value of the element at index `s - 1` in the list `a` from `ql`. 

Given the initial state:
- `q` is greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `m` is 0 (unchanged).
- `i` is 1 (unchanged).
- `ql` is an input integer (its value changes).
- `s` is an integer between 0 and the length of `a` (unchanged).
- The element at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql` (unchanged).

After executing the code:
- The value of `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`q` is greater than 0; `m` is 0; `i` is 1; `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`; `s` is an integer between 0 and the length of `a`; the element at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql`.**
