To determine the output state, we need to understand what the `bisect_left` function does. The `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module returns the index where the element `ql` would be inserted into the sorted list `a` to maintain the order.

Given the initial state:
- `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `ql` is an input integer.

The line of code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` will assign to `s` the index where `ql` should be inserted into the list `a`.

Since the exact contents of `a` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we know that `s` will be an integer between 0 and `len(a)` inclusive, indicating the position where `ql` fits in the sorted list `a`.

The other variables (`v`, `q`, `m`, `i`, and `ql`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`; `q` must be greater than 0; `m` is 0; `i` is 1; `ql` is an input integer; `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted into the sorted list `a`.**
