The initial state provides us with the values of `aOnes` and `bOnes`, both of which are set to `newk`. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not reference these variables. Instead, it simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables**: `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both set to `newk`, but `newk` is not used in the `print` statement.
2. **Examine the Print Statement**: The `print` statement contains only the string `'yes'`.

Given this, the output will be the string `'yes'` without any reference to the values of `aOnes` or `bOnes`.

Output: **yes**
