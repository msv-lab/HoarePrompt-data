Postcondition: **`aOnes` is 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `aOnes` is 0. `bOnes` is 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `bOnes` is 0. `t` is incremented by 1. `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their input values. `a` and `b` retain their input values. `newk` is `k // 2`. `i` is 1. `k` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b` unless the conditions for `aOnes` or `bOnes` being 1 are met.**
