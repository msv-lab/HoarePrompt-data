The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, or `newk`. It only terminates the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement mentioned in the context, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State except for the fact that `t` was incremented by 1 before the `break` statement was executed.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input where `k` must be at least 3; `i` is 3; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `newk` is `k // 2`.**
