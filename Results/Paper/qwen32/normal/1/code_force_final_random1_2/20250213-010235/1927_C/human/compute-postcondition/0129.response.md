Postcondition: **`aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `t` is incremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1; `k` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`; either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`; `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.**
