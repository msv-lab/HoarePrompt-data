Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `i` is 1; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` is set to 1 if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, otherwise `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is set to 1. If `i` is not in `a`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `aOnes` remains 0 and `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`. If neither condition is met, `bOnes` remains 0.**
