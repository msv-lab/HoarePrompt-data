The initial state provides information about the variables `i`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, and `newk`. Specifically, it states that `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`, but it does not provide explicit values for these variables or any other variables involved in the loop condition or break condition. 

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `i`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, or `newk`. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **yes**
