The given code snippet initializes a variable `bOnes` to 0. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `bOnes` with the value 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0.**
