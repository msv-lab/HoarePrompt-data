Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 1; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1; `i` is present in both `a` and `b`. If `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`.**
