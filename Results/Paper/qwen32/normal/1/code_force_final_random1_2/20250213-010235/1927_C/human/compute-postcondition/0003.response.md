The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
