Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where each element b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of values n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
        elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `k + 1` or the value where the loop breaks, `aOnes` and `bOnes` reflect the number of increments that occurred during the loop. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, then the condition in the if statement is true. Otherwise, at least one of `aOnes` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, at least one of `aOnes` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers reflecting the counts from lists `a` and `b` up to `k`. `t` is incremented by `k`. `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `newk` retain their initial values. `i` is `k + 1`. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, the if part executes; otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
