Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input where `k` must be at least 2; `i` is 2; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.**
