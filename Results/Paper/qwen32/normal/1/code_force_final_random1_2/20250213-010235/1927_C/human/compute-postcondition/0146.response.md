Postcondition: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers, `t` has been incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their values from the input where `k` must be at least 2, `a` and `b` retain their input values, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 2. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If none of these conditions are met, no further changes are made to `aOnes` or `bOnes`.**
