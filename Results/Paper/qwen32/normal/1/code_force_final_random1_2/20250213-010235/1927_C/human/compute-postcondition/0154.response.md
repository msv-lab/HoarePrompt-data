Output State: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers, `t` has been incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their values from the input where `k` must be at least 3, `a` and `b` retain their input values, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `t` has already been incremented by 1 before the `break` statement. The `break` statement causes us to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
