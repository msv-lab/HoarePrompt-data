The code snippet assigns the value of `k // 2` to the variable `newk`. This operation performs integer division of `k` by 2, discarding any remainder. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `newk` is `k // 2`.**
