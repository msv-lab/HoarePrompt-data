Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 1; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1. If `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` remains unchanged. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, and `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` remains unchanged. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is set to 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0.**
