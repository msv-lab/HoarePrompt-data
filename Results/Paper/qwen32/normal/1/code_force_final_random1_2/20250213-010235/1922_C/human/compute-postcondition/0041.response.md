To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the information given in the initial state and analyze how the variables `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are computed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`i`**: Initialized to 0.
3. **`n`**: Greater than 2.
4. **`l`**: A list of integers.
5. **`d1`**: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`.
6. **`d2`**: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, where `d2[n-1]` is set to 1, and for each `i` from `n-2` down to 1, `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` depending on the condition.
7. **`m`**: An input integer that must be greater than 0.
8. **`x`**: The first input integer.
9. **`y`**: The second input integer, and `y > x`.

### Analysis of `d1`:
- `d1` is a `defaultdict` initialized with a default integer value of 0.
- `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`. This means `d1[i]` for `i >= 2` will hold some value derived from the differences between elements of `l`.

### Analysis of `d2`:
- `d2[n-1]` is set to 1.
- For each `i` from `n-2` down to 1, `d2[i]` is updated based on the condition: it is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.

### Key Points:
- The exact values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` depend on the specific values in the list `l`.
- Since the exact list `l` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.
- However, we know that `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are values stored in the `d1` dictionary based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the lack of specific values for the list `l`, we can only describe the output in terms of the values stored in `d1` for indices `y` and `x`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are values in the d1 dictionary based on the differences between consecutive elements of the list l)**
