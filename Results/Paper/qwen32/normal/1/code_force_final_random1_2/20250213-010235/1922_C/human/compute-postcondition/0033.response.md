The given code snippet updates the value of `d2[i]` to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. This means that the value of `d2[i]` is now specifically `1` plus whatever the previous value of `d2[i + 1]` was.

Given the initial state, the only change is to `d2[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is n - 2, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, and `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.**
