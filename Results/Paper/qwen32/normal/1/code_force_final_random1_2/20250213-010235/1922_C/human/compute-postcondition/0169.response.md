Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of cities, a list `a` of `n` integers representing the unique coordinates of the cities in increasing order, and an integer `m` representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `x_i` and `y_i` representing the indices of two different cities. The function returns a result for each query indicating the closest city to the midpoint between the cities at indices `x_i` and `y_i`.**
