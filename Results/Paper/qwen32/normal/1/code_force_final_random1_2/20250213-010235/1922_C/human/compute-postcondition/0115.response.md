The given code snippet only initializes `d1` as a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. This means that `d1` will now be a dictionary that returns `0` for any key that does not exist in it, and it will not affect any other variables.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `d1` is re-initialized. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `m`, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and values from `d2[1]` to `d2[previous `n` - 1]` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**
