Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 (and no specific entries), `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, and no further changes to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[4]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is set to `l[3] - l[2]`.**
