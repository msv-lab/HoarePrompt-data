To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`, let's analyze the given initial state and the relevant parts of the code.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `n`: Greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`.
   - `d2`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, where `d2[n-1]` is set to 1, and for each `i` from `n-2` down to 1, `d2[i]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop.
   - `m`: An input integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `x` and `y`: Two integers read from the input.
   - `j`: Initialized to 1.

2. **Key Points about `d2`:**
   - `d2[n-1]` is set to 1.
   - For each `i` from `n-2` down to 1, `d2[i]` is updated based on the condition:
     - If a certain condition holds (not explicitly detailed in the initial state), `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`.
     - Otherwise, `d2[i]` is set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:

The print statement is `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`. To understand what this will print, we need to know the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

- `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are values in the `d2` dictionary, which are determined by the updates described above.
- Since the specific values of `x` and `y` are read from the input, we cannot determine their exact numerical values without the input data.
- However, we can describe the values in terms of how they are computed based on the list `l` and the conditions specified.

### Output Description:

Given the initial state, the exact numerical values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` depend on the contents of the list `l` and the specific values of `x` and `y`. Without the specific input values, we can only describe the computation process.

The value `d2[y] - d2[x]` represents the difference between the values at indices `y` and `x` in the `d2` dictionary, which are computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and the conditions in the loop.

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[i] is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of l and the conditions in the loop for i from n-1 down to 1)**
