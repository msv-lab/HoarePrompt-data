The given code snippet modifies the value of `d2[i]` by setting it to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. This change affects only the variable `d2` at index `i`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains an integer such that \(n \geq 2\).
- `i` remains \(n - 3\).
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1` remains a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and updated values based on the differences in the list `l`.
- `d2` is updated such that `d2[i]` is now `1 + d2[i + 1]`. All other values in `d2` remain unchanged.
- `m` remains greater than 0.
- `j` remains `m-1`.
- `x` and `y` remain the last pair of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 2\); `i` is \(n - 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and updated values based on the differences in the list `l`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1, and `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`; `m` is greater than 0; `j` is `m-1`; `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**
