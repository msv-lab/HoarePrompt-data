To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the logic involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `n`: An integer where \(n \geq 2\).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, updated based on the differences in the list `l`.
   - `d2`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, except `d2[n - 1]` which is set to 1. Other values are calculated within a loop.
   - `m`: An integer input from the user such that \(m \geq 1\).
   - `j`: Initialized to 1.
   - `x` and `y`: The last pair of integers read from the input. If `y > x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Logic:**
   - The `d2` dictionary is updated in a loop, but the exact logic isn't detailed here. We know that `d2[n - 1]` is initialized to 1, and other values are calculated based on some conditions involving the list `l` and the loop.
   - The `print` statement outputs the difference between `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

### Analysis:
- The specific values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` depend on the loop logic and the input data, which are not fully detailed here.
- However, we can infer that `d2` is a dictionary where keys are integers (possibly related to indices or values in `l`), and values are counts or sums derived from the list `l` and the loop logic.

### Output Description:
Given the information, the output of `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` will be the difference between the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in the `d2` dictionary. Since the exact values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are not specified, we describe the output in terms of these keys.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2 is a defaultdict with values calculated based on the input list l and loop logic)**
