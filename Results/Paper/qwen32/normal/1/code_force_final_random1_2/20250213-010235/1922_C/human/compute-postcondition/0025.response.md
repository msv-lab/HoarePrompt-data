Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is n - 2, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. Additionally, the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.**
