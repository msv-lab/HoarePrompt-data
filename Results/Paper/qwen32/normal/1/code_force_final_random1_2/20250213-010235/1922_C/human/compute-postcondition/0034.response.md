Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is n - 2, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. `d2[i]` is now `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**

In natural language: The value of `d2[i]` has been updated to be the sum of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of the list `l` and the previous value of `d2[i + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
