### Reasoning:

The provided program seems to have logical errors in the way it calculates the distances `d1` and `d2` and how it uses these distances to answer the queries. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initialization and Calculation of `d1` and `d2`:**
   - `d1` and `d2` are dictionaries that should store the cumulative cost to reach each city starting from the leftmost and rightmost cities respectively.
   - The program initializes `d1[2]` and `d2[n-1]` with incorrect values. Specifically, `d1[2]` should be initialized based on the distance from the first city to the second city, and `d2[n-1]` should be initialized based on the distance from the second-to-last city to the last city.
   - The loops for calculating `d1` and `d2` do not correctly accumulate the costs. They seem to be adding the cost to move to the next closest city instead of accumulating the total cost to reach each city.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The program attempts to use the precomputed `d1` and `d2` to answer each query by taking the difference in cumulative costs. However, since `d1` and `d2` are not correctly computed, the differences will not yield the correct results.

3. **Logic for Closest Cities:**
   - The program does not explicitly compute the closest city for each city, which is necessary to correctly calculate the cost of moving to the closest city.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program is not correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
