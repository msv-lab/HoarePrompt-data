You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it has computed the distances `d1` and `d2` based on the given list `l` and the conditions specified. It has also processed all `m` queries for each test case, printing the appropriate distance difference for each query pair `(x, y)`. The variables `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, and `y` reflect the state after processing the last test case and its queries.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of city coordinates and a series of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the distance difference based on predefined rules involving the closest cities relative to the midpoint between the queried cities.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to travel between pairs of cities.
   - There are two types of moves:
     - Move to the closest city for 1 coin.
     - Move directly to any other city for the distance in coins.
   - Each city has a unique closest city.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their positions `l`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It initializes two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` to store the minimum cost to reach each city starting from the leftmost and rightmost cities, respectively.
   - It calculates the cost to move from the leftmost city to each subsequent city using the closest city rule.
   - Similarly, it calculates the cost to move from the rightmost city to each preceding city using the closest city rule.
   - For each query, it calculates the cost to move from city `x` to city `y` by either subtracting the accumulated costs from `d1` or `d2`.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the cost to move from city `i` to city `j` can be calculated simply by subtracting the accumulated costs from `d1` or `d2`. This is not always true because the closest city rule may require multiple intermediate moves.
   - The program does not handle the case where the direct move (not using the closest city) might be cheaper than the series of moves using the closest city.
   - The program does not correctly compute the cost for arbitrary pairs of cities. It only considers moving in one direction (left-to-right or right-to-left) without considering the possibility of moving in both directions and combining the results.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
     - Determine the closest city for each city.
     - Use dynamic programming or a similar approach to calculate the minimum cost to move between any two cities, considering both direct moves and moves through the closest city.
     - For each query, compute the minimum cost by comparing the direct move and the move through the closest city.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
