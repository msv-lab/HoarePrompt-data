The provided code snippet reads a new line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns them to the list `l`. This means that the previous list `l` is overwritten with the new input values.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged except for `l`, which gets updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `m`, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 2 to the previous `n` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and values from `d2[1]` to `d2[previous `n` - 1]` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**
