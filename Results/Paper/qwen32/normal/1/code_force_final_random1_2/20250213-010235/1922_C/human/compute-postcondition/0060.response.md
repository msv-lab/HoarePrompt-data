The given code snippet reassigns `d2` to a new `defaultdict` with default integer values of 0. This means any existing entries in `d2` are lost, and `d2` is reset to its initial state as described in the initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 (and no specific entries), `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 (and no specific entries), `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, and no further changes to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration.**
