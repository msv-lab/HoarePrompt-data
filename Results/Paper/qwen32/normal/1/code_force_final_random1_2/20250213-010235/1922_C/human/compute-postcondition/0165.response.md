To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `n`: An integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `i`: Initialized to 0.
- `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, updated based on differences in the list `l`.
- `d2`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, but `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1. Other values are calculated according to some loop logic.
- `m`: An integer input from the user such that \(m \geq 1\).
- `j`: Initialized to 2.
- `x` and `y`: The last pair of integers read from the input. It is specified that if `y > x`, then `y` is indeed greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Key Focus:
We need to understand the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` to determine the output of `d2[y] - d2[x]`.

#### Understanding `d2`:
- `d2` is initialized with a default value of 0 for all keys except `d2[n - 1]` which is set to 1.
- The values of `d2` are updated through some loop logic, but this specific logic is not detailed in the initial state. However, we know the initial value of `d2[n - 1]` is 1.

#### Values of `x` and `y`:
- `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.
- The relationship between `x` and `y` is given: if `y > x`, then `y` is indeed greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Determining the Output:
Given that `d2` is initialized with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and other values as 0, and without further details on how `d2` is updated, we can infer the following:
- If `x` and `y` are both different from `n - 1`, then `d2[x]` and `d2[y]` would both be 0 (assuming no other updates to `d2` affect these keys).
- If either `x` or `y` is equal to `n - 1`, then the corresponding `d2[x]` or `d2[y]` would be 1.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
1. **Both `x` and `y` are not equal to `n - 1`:**
   - `d2[x] = 0`
   - `d2[y] = 0`
   - `d2[y] - d2[x] = 0 - 0 = 0`

2. **One of `x` or `y` is equal to `n - 1`:**
   - Without loss of generality, assume `y = n - 1` and `x ≠ n - 1`:
     - `d2[x] = 0`
     - `d2[y] = 1`
     - `d2[y] - d2[x] = 1 - 0 = 1`
   - Conversely, if `x = n - 1` and `y ≠ n - 1`:
     - `d2[x] = 1`
     - `d2[y] = 0`
     - `d2[y] - d2[x] = 0 - 1 = -1`

3. **Both `x` and `y` are equal to `n - 1`:**
   - `d2[x] = 1`
   - `d2[y] = 1`
   - `d2[y] - d2[x] = 1 - 1 = 0`

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the output of `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` depends on whether `x` and `y` are equal to `n - 1` or not. Given the constraints and the nature of `d2`, the possible outputs are 0, 1, or -1.

However, since the exact values of `x` and `y` relative to `n - 1` are not provided, the most precise description we can give is based on the possible outcomes derived from the given conditions.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2 is a defaultdict with d2[n - 1] = 1 and other values as 0, and x, y are the last pair of integers read from the input)**
