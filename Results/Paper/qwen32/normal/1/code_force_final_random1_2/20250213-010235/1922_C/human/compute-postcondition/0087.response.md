Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `n - 3`; `n` is greater than 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 2 to `n` updated based on the conditions in the loop; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d2[n - 1]` set to 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[n - 3]` is set to `1 + d2[n - 2]`. Otherwise, `d2[n - 3]` is set to `l[n - 3] - l[n - 4] + d2[n - 2]`. `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `j` is `m-1`; no further changes to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration.**
