The given code initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with a default integer value of 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `l`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0.**
