To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and how they relate to the print statement:

1. **Variables and Data Structures:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with keys from 2 to `n`. Its values are updated based on certain conditions within a loop.
   - `d2`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0. Its values from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` are also updated based on conditions within a loop.
   - `m`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `j`: Set to `m-1`.
   - `x` and `y`: Two new integers read from the input. It is specified that if `y` is greater than `x`, the condition `y > x` holds; otherwise, `y <= x`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`.
   - This statement calculates the difference between the values stored in `d1` for keys `y` and `x`.

3. **Values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`:**
   - The values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` depend on how `d1` is updated within the loop. Since the specific updates to `d1` are not detailed in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these values.
   - Given that `d1` is a `defaultdict`, if a key does not exist, it defaults to 0. However, since `y` and `x` are used as keys, we assume they have been updated in the loop.

4. **Condition on `y` and `x`:**
   - The condition `y > x` or `y <= x` affects how the values might be interpreted but does not directly influence the calculation of `d1[y] - d1[x]`.

Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement is the difference between the values stored in `d1` for keys `y` and `x`. Since the exact values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are the values in the defaultdict d1 for keys y and x respectively)**
