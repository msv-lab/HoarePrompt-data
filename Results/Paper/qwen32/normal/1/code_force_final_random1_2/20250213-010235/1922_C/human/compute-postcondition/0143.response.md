Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 2\); `i` is \(n - 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and updated values based on the differences in the list `l`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1. If the difference between the \(i\)-th and \((i-1)\)-th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the \((i+1)\)-th and \(i\)-th elements of `l`, then `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `m` is greater than 0; `j` is `m-1`; `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**
