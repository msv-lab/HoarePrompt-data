Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine if the program correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to determine the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums. The solution involves combinatorial mathematics, particularly the use of modular inverses and binomial coefficients.

### Code Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. When `b = 1000000007`, this can be used to find the modular inverse of `a` modulo `1000000007` if `gcd(a, 1000000007) = 1`.

Here's a breakdown of the function:
- **Base Case**: If `b == 0`, it returns `(1, 0)`. This is correct because `a*1 + b*0 = a`, which is useful for the recursive step.
- **Recursive Case**: If `a < b`, it swaps `a` and `b` and returns the swapped results. This ensures that `a >= b` throughout the recursion.
- **Modulo Case**: If `a % b == 0`, it returns `(0, 1)`. This is incorrect for the purpose of finding the modular inverse. Instead, it should return `(0, 1)` only when `b == 0`.
- **General Recursive Case**: If `a % b != 0`, it recursively calls `func_1(b, a % b)` and adjusts the results accordingly. This is correct.

The critical issue here is the handling of the case `a % b == 0`. The function should return `(0, 1)` only when `b == 0`. For other cases, it should proceed with the recursive step.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a, b)`
This function computes `a * b^-1 mod 1000000007` using the result from `func_1`.

- It calls `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to get the modular inverse of `b`.
- It multiplies the result with `a` and takes the result modulo `1000000007`.

### Function Summary
The summary for `func_2` is correct. It accurately describes the function's behavior as computing the product of `a` and the modular inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`.

### Conclusion
The primary issue lies in `func_1`. Specifically, the handling of the case `a % b == 0` is incorrect. This will lead to incorrect results when trying to compute the modular inverse. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect due to this flaw.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect due to the improper handling of the base case in `func_1`.

Final: **False**
