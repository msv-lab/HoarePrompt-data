### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem described. Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand why the assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of permutations of length `n` where certain indices are prefix maximums and suffix maximums. This involves understanding the constraints imposed by these maximums and counting the valid permutations accordingly.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which seem to be related to modular arithmetic, specifically computing modular inverses. Here's what each function does:

1. **`func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function appears to compute the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and also finds coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
   - If `b == 0`, it returns `(1, 0)`.
   - If `a < b`, it swaps `a` and `b` and calls itself recursively.
   - If `a % b == 0`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
   - Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with `b` and `a % b`, and uses the results to compute the coefficients.

2. **`func_2(a, b)`**:
   - This function computes the modular inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007` using `func_1`, and then multiplies it by `a` and takes the result modulo `1000000007`.

#### Relevance to the Problem:
While the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are useful for modular arithmetic, they do not directly address the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The problem requires combinatorial logic to determine the valid placements of numbers in the permutation given the constraints of prefix and suffix maximums.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not contain any logic to handle the permutation constraints or count the valid permutations. It only includes functions for modular arithmetic, which are not directly relevant to solving the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
