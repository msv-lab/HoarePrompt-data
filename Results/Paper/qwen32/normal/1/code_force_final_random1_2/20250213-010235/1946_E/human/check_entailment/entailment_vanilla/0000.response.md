To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze both the logic and the implementation of the functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires us to find the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums. The solution involves combinatorial mathematics, specifically the use of modular inverses and binomial coefficients.

### Analysis of the Functions

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
This function seems to compute the extended Euclidean algorithm, which finds integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. In the context of modular arithmetic, this can be used to find the modular inverse of `b` modulo `a` when `gcd(a, b) = 1`.

- If `b == 0`, it returns `(1, 0)`, which is correct because any number multiplied by 1 plus 0 times 0 equals the number itself.
- If `a < b`, it recursively calls `func_1(b, a)` and swaps the results, which is correct.
- If `a % b == 0`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`, but this part seems incorrect. It should return `(0, 1)` when `b == 0` and handle the case where `a % b == 0` differently.
- Otherwise, it recursively calls `func_1(b, a % b)` and adjusts the results accordingly, which is correct.

However, the function seems to be intended to compute the modular inverse, but the base case handling for `a % b == 0` is incorrect. It should be handled differently to ensure correctness.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a, b)`
This function computes `a * b^-1 mod 1000000007` using the result from `func_1`. Here, `b^-1` is the modular inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`.

- It calls `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to get the modular inverse of `b`.
- It multiplies the result with `a` and takes the result modulo `1000000007`.

### Conclusion

The implementation of `func_1` has an issue with the base case handling for `a % b == 0`. This will lead to incorrect results when trying to compute the modular inverse. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect due to this flaw.
