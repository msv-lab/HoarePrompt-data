Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. It returns different values based on the following cases:
- Case_1: If `a` is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0).
- Case_2: If `a` is greater than `b`, it returns the values `d` and `c` as returned by `func_1(b, a)`.
- Case_3: If `b` is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 1 - q), where q is the integer quotient of `a` divided by `b`.
- Case_4: Otherwise, it calculates `d` as the remainder when `b` is divided by `(a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` is the quotient when `b` is divided by `(a % b)`, and returns these two values.**
