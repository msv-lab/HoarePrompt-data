Let's break down the given code and the initial state to determine the output state.

Given:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `a` is not divisible by `b`.
- `c` is calculated as `b // (a % b)`.
- `d` is calculated as `b % (a % b)`.

The code returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`.

First, let's express `c` and `d` in terms of `a` and `b`:
- `c = b // (a % b)`
- `d = b % (a % b)`

Now, the return statement is `d, c - a // b * d`.

Let's substitute `c` and `d` into the return statement:
- The first part of the return is `d`.
- The second part of the return is `c - a // b * d`.

Since `d = b % (a % b)`, and `c = b // (a % b)`, we know that `c` and `d` are the quotient and remainder when `b` is divided by `(a % b)` respectively.

Thus, the output can be described as follows:
- The first value returned is `d`, which is the remainder when `b` is divided by `(a % b)`.
- The second value returned is `c - a // b * d`.

Given the constraints, we can conclude:
- `d` is a non-negative integer less than `(a % b)`.
- `c` is a non-negative integer representing the quotient when `b` is divided by `(a % b)`.

Therefore, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **The program returns `d`, which is the remainder when `b` is divided by `(a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` is the quotient when `b` is divided by `(a % b)`**.
