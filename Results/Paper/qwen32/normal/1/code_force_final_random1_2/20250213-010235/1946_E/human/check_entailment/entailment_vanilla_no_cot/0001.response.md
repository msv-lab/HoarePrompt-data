To determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to understand what the problem requires and how the program attempts to solve it.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to find the number of permutations of length `n` such that the given indices are the prefix and suffix maximums. Here's a breakdown of the requirements:

1. **Prefix Maximums**: These are positions in the permutation where the value at that position is greater than all previous values.
2. **Suffix Maximums**: These are positions in the permutation where the value at that position is greater than all subsequent values.

Given these definitions, the task is to count the number of permutations that satisfy both sets of conditions.

### Program Analysis

The provided code includes two functions:

1. **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function appears to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. It returns a tuple `(c, d)` such that `b*c + a*d = gcd(a, b)`. If `b == 0`, it returns `(1, 0)`, which is the base case for the recursion. If `a < b`, it swaps `a` and `b` and calls itself recursively. If `a % b == 0`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`. Otherwise, it recursively computes the result for `b` and `a % b`.

2. **`func_2(a, b)`**: This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007` and multiplies it by `a`, returning the result modulo `1000000007`.

### Correctness Evaluation

The provided code does not directly address the problem of counting permutations with specified prefix and suffix maximums. Instead, it seems to implement some mathematical operations related to modular arithmetic, specifically computing modular inverses.

To solve the problem correctly, the program would need to:

1. Parse the input to get the values of `n`, `m1`, `m2`, the list of prefix maximum indices, and the list of suffix maximum indices.
2. Use combinatorial logic to count the number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions.
3. Output the result modulo `1000000007`.

Since the provided code does not implement any logic to count permutations based on the given conditions, it is incorrect for solving the problem.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
