### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works and whether it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to `200001` modulo `10^9 + 7` and stores them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for computing combinations later in the program.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums `p` and the suffix maximums `s`.

3. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index (`p[-1] == s[0]`), if the first prefix maximum index is `1` (`p[0] == 1`), and if the last suffix maximum index is `n` (`s[-1] == n`). If any of these conditions fail, the program outputs `0` because such a permutation cannot exist.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - If the initial checks pass, the program calculates the number of valid permutations using combinations.
   - It iterates through the suffix maximums `s` and calculates the number of ways to arrange the numbers between each pair of suffix maximums using combinations.
   - Similarly, it iterates through the prefix maximums `p` (excluding the first and last) and calculates the number of ways to arrange the numbers between each pair of prefix maximums.
   - It also multiplies the results by the factorial of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Throughout the calculations, the program uses modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure that the results do not overflow and remain within the required constraints.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Combination Calculation**:
  - The combination calculation is crucial for determining the number of valid permutations. The use of precomputed factorials and the `func_2` function for modular inverse ensures that the combination calculations are performed correctly.
  
- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - The initial checks handle edge cases where the given prefix and suffix maximums cannot form a valid permutation.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The precomputation of factorials and the efficient use of combinations make the program suitable for handling the upper limits of the input constraints.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid permutations given the prefix and suffix maximums. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
