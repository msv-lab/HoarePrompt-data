To determine the output state, we need to consider the function `func_1(b, a)`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d` that will be returned. However, we know that `c` and `d` will be assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.

Given the initial state, `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is not equal to 0, and `a` is less than `b`. After executing `c, d = func_1(b, a)`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, but `c` and `d` are newly assigned based on the return values of `func_1`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is not equal to 0, and `a` is less than `b`; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`**.
