To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem involves calculating the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums, and then outputting this count modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The provided code includes two functions:

1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function appears to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. It returns a tuple `(c, d)` such that `c * b ≡ 1 (mod a)` and `d * a ≡ 1 (mod b)`. However, the implementation seems to be intended for computing the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a`, which would only return `c`.

2. `func_2(a, b)`: This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it by `a` to get the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

However, the provided code does not include the main logic to solve the problem described. The main logic should involve:

- Parsing the input to get the number of test cases, the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, the number of suffix maximums `m2`, and the lists of indices for these maximums.
- Using combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
- Outputting the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given that the provided code only includes utility functions for modular arithmetic and does not contain the main logic to solve the problem, the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description is:

**Correctness: False**

The program is incomplete and does not implement the solution to the problem as described.
