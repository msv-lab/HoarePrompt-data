To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1`. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we'll assume it follows a common pattern such as the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and returning intermediate results.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `a` is not divisible by `b`.

The line of code `c, d = func_1(b, a % b)` suggests that `func_1` is likely performing some operation using `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

Assuming `func_1` returns the quotient and remainder of the division, we can deduce:
- `c` would be the quotient of `b` divided by `a % b`.
- `d` would be the remainder of `b` divided by `a % b`.

However, without the exact definition of `func_1`, we can only make an educated guess based on typical patterns. If `func_1` is indeed related to the Euclidean algorithm, it might return the quotient and remainder of the division of the first argument by the second argument. But since `func_1` is not explicitly defined, we will consider the general case where `func_1` returns two values based on its arguments.

Given the lack of specifics about `func_1`, let's assume `func_1` returns `(b // (a % b), b % (a % b))` as a generic example. This assumption aligns with typical operations seen in such functions.

Therefore, the output state would be:
- `c` is `b // (a % b)`.
- `d` is `b % (a % b)`.

The other conditions remain unchanged:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `a` is not divisible by `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is not equal to 0, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` is `b // (a % b)`, `d` is `b % (a % b)`**.
