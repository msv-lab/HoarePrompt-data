The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` is `n-1`, `suf[i + 1]` is `suf[n]`.

The initial state specifies that `smin` is a list defined based on certain conditions involving `suf`. After appending `suf[n]` to `smin`, the new state of `smin` will include this additional element.

Output State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[i + 1], 0), suf[n], suf[n]]` if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, otherwise `smin` is `[0, min(suf[i + 1], 0), min(suf[i + 1], 0), suf[n]]`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, `smin` now includes an additional element `suf[n]` at the end.
