The code snippet appends the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given the initial state, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`), but this operation does not affect the current execution of the line `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` because `i` is used in its pre-incremented form in this line.

Thus, the list `suf` will have a new element added to it, which is the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`. The condition `n` must be greater than `i` remains valid after the execution of the line since the increment of `i` happens afterward.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is `i + 1`; `suf` has a new element appended which is `suf[i] + l[i]`.**
