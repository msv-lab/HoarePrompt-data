The code appends a new element to the list `suf`. This new element is calculated as `suf[i] + l[i]`, where `i` is `j + 4`.

Given the initial state:
- `suf` is `[0, l[0], ..., suf[j + 2] + l[j + 2]]`
- `smin` is `[0, suf[1] if suf[1] < smin[0] else smin[0], suf[2] if suf[2] < smin[1] else smin[1], ..., suf[n] if suf[n] < smin[n-1] else smin[n-1]]`
- `sm` is updated based on the given conditions (but its exact value is not specified)
- `j` is `j + 1`
- `t` remains the same
- `b` is a list of substrings from the input
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `k` is `int(b[1])`
- `l` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is `j + 4`

After executing the line `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])`, the list `suf` will now include an additional element at the end, which is the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], ..., suf[j + 2] + l[j + 2], suf[j + 4] + l[j + 4]]`; `smin` is `[0, suf[1] if suf[1] < smin[0] else smin[0], suf[2] if suf[2] < smin[1] else smin[1], ..., suf[n] if suf[n] < smin[n-1] else smin[n-1]]`; `sm` is updated based on the given conditions; `j` is `j + 1`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of substrings from the input; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is `j + 4`**.
