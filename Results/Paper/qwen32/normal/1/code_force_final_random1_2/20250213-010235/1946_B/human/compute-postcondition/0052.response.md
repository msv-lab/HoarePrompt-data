The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has taken on some value, and the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `t`.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `j` should be incremented by 1.
- `t` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value `k` where `0 <= k < t`. At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`; `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`. If `sm < 0`, then `sm` is `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`. Otherwise, `sm` is `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`. `j` is `k + 1`, `t` remains the same**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we'll generalize it as `j` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`; `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`. If `sm < 0`, then `sm` is `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`. Otherwise, `sm` is `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`. `j` is `j + 1`, `t` remains the same**.
