To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n + 1):`, which means the variables `i` and `n` are the ones we can adjust.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Variable `n`:** This variable is already given as an integer greater than 0. Since the loop runs from `0` to `n` (inclusive), `n` should remain as it is because it defines the range of the loop.

2. **Variable `i`:** This variable is the loop counter and is initialized automatically by the `range` function in Python. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be set manually since it will take its initial value from the `range` function. However, to ensure the loop starts correctly, we can specify that `i` should be initialized to `0`.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should include the correct initialization of `i` and the confirmation that `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], suf[2], ..., suf[n])]`, `sm` is `-111`, `j` is `j + n`, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is `int(b[1])`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0`**
