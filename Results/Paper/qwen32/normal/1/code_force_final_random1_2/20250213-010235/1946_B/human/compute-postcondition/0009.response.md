The code appends the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given that `n` must be greater than 0, this condition remains unchanged. The lists `suf` and `l` are modified by the operation, specifically `suf` gains a new element which is the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `suf` has a new element appended, which is `suf[i] + l[i]`; `l` remains unchanged.**
