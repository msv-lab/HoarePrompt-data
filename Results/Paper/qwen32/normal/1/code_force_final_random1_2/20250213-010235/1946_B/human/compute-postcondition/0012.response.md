To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than `i`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `suf` has a new element appended which is `suf[i] + l[i]`.

From the loop statement:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

Let's break it down:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's call it `i_old`.
- After the increment, `i` becomes `i_new = i_old + 1`.
- For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than `i_new`.

Since the problem specifies that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration as `i + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Note that `suf` and `l` are not part of the loop head and thus their states do not need to be adjusted according to the loop head rules.
