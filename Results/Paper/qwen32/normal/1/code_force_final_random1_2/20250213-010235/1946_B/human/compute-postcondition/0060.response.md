Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state:

Initial State: 
- `suf` is `[0]`
- `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`
- `sm` is calculated based on given conditions (not explicitly defined in the initial state)
- `j` is `j + 1`
- `t` remains the same
- `b` is a list of strings from the input where `b[0]` must be an integer greater than 0
- `n` is `int(b[0])` and must be greater than 0
- `k` is `int(b[1])`
- `l` is a list of integers from the input

Code Snippet:
```python
suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])
```

Here, `suf` is being updated by appending a new element which is the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `i` is a valid index within the bounds of `suf` and `l`.

Let's assume `i` is `0` for the sake of calculation (as it's the only known index in `suf` initially).

Impact:
- `suf` will now have an additional element which is `suf[0] + l[0]` i.e., `0 + l[0]` which is `l[0]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0]]`; `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`; `sm` is calculated based on given conditions; `j` is `j + 1`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of strings from the input where `b[0]` must be an integer greater than 0; `n` is `int(b[0])` and must be greater than 0; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
