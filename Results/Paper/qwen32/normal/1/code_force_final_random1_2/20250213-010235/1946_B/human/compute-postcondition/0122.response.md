The code appends the current element at index `i` of `smin` to the end of `smin`. This means that the last element of `smin` will now be repeated.

Given the initial state:
- `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`
- `smin` is `[0]`
- `sm` is updated based on the given conditions (unchanged in this snippet)
- `j` is `j + n` (unchanged in this snippet)
- `t` remains the same (unchanged in this snippet)
- `b` is a list of substrings from the input (unchanged in this snippet)
- `n` is an integer greater than 0 (unchanged in this snippet)
- `k` is `int(b[1])` (unchanged in this snippet)
- `l` is a list of integers from the input (unchanged in this snippet)
- `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]` (unchanged in this snippet)

After executing the line `smin.append(smin[i])`, the new state of `smin` will be `[0, smin[i]]`.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`; `smin` is `[0, smin[i]]`; `sm` is updated based on the given conditions; `j` is `j + n`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of substrings from the input; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers from the input; `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`.**
