Postcondition: **`suf` is [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)], `smin` is [0, suf[1] if suf[1] < smin[0] else smin[0], suf[2] if suf[2] < smin[1] else smin[1], ..., suf[n] if suf[n] < smin[n-1] else smin[n-1]], `sm` is either -111 or the previous value of `sm` updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm`, `j` is j + n, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is an integer from b[0] and must be at least 0, `k` is an integer from b[1], `l` is a list of integers from the input, and `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` was initially -111.**
