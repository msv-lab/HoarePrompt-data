To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Since the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive), the next value of `i` should be 2.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

All other variables (`suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `j`, `t`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`; `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], suf[2], ..., suf[n])]`; `sm` is `suf[1] - smin[1]` if `suf[1] - smin[1] > sm` or `sm == -111`, otherwise `sm` remains unchanged; `j` is `j + n`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of substrings from the input; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 2**
