To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is `i` in this case. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)]`
- `smin` is `[0, suf[1] if suf[1] < smin[0] else smin[0], suf[2] if suf[2] < smin[1] else smin[1], ..., suf[n] if suf[n] < smin[n-1] else smin[n-1]]`
- `sm` is `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` is `-111`
- `j` is `j + n`
- `t` remains the same
- `b` is a list of strings from the input
- `n` is an integer from `b[0]` and must be at least `0`
- `k` is an integer from `b[1]`
- `l` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is `(j + n) + 1`

In the loop statement `for i in range(n + 1):`, the loop variable `i` is incremented automatically by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Since `i` is set to `(j + n) + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value it would take in the sequence defined by the loop. This means `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `((j + n) + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `(j + n) + 2`.

All other variables (`suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `j`, `t`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`suf` is [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)], `smin` is [0, suf[1] if suf[1] < smin[0] else smin[0], suf[2] if suf[2] < smin[1] else smin[1], ..., suf[n] if suf[n] < smin[n-1] else smin[n-1]], `sm` is suf[i] - smin[i] if suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm is -111, `j` is j + n, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is an integer from b[0] and must be at least 0, `k` is an integer from b[1], `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is (j + n) + 2**
