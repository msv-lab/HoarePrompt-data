Postcondition: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `suf[i] - smin[i]` (or `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `sm` was `-111`), and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is `i + 1`.**
