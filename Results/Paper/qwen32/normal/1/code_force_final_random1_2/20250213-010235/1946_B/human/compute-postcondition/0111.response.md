To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the existing variables.

Given Initial State:
- `suf` is `[0]`
- `smin` is defined based on `suf` and some comparison logic, but its exact values aren't specified beyond the first element being `0`.
- `sm` is updated based on certain conditions (not detailed in the snippet).
- `j` is `j + 1` (implying `j` was previously defined and is now incremented).
- `t` remains the same.
- `b` is a list of substrings from the input.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is `int(b[1])`.
- `l` is a list of integers from the input.

The Code Snippet:
```python
suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])
```

This line appends a new element to the list `suf`. The new element is the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`.

Since `suf` initially contains only one element `[0]`, `i` must be `0` for the code to execute without causing an `IndexError`. Therefore, the new element appended to `suf` is `suf[0] + l[0]`, which simplifies to `0 + l[0]` or just `l[0]`.

Thus, the new state of `suf` becomes `[0, l[0]]`.

No other variables are modified by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0]]`, `smin` is `[0, suf[1] if suf[1] < smin[0] else smin[0], suf[2] if suf[2] < smin[1] else smin[1], ..., suf[n] if suf[n] < smin[n-1] else smin[n-1]]`, `sm` is updated based on the given conditions, `j` is `j + 1`, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is `int(b[1])`, `l` is a list of integers from the input**.
