The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and maps those parts to integers, storing them in the list `l`. This operation does not affect the existing variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. Instead, it introduces a new list `l` which contains the integers from the input.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the new list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of `b[0]`, `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping the split input to integers.**
