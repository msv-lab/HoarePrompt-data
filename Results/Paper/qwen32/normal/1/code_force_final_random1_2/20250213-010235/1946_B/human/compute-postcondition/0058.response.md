The code appends `0` to the list `suf`. Since `suf` was initially an empty list `[]`, after appending `0`, `suf` becomes `[0]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0]`; `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`; If `sm < 0`, then `sm` is `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`. Otherwise, `sm` is `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`. `j` is `j + 1`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of strings from the input; `n` is `int(b[0])`; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
