The code snippet modifies the value of `sm` by taking its modulus with \(10^9 + 7\). This operation ensures that `sm` remains within a specific range, which is often used in programming to prevent integer overflow and to meet problem constraints.

Given the initial state:
- `suf` is a list of cumulative sums.
- `smin` is a list derived from `suf` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding element in `suf` and the previous element in `smin`.
- `sm` is initially set to \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\) and is non-negative.

After executing the code `sm = sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, the value of `sm` is updated to be the remainder when `sm` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

Output State: **`suf` is a list [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]; `smin` is a list [0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]; `sm` is (2 + suf[n]) % (10 ** 9 + 7) and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.**
