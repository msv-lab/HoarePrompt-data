The given code modifies the value of `sm` by taking its modulus with \(10^9 + 7\). This operation ensures that `sm` remains within a specific range, which is common in programming to prevent integer overflow and manage large numbers efficiently.

Given the initial state:
- `suf` is a list of cumulative sums.
- `smin` is a list starting with 0 followed by the minimum values of `suf` from index 1 onwards.
- `sm` is initially set to \(2 + suf[n]\) and is guaranteed to be non-negative.

After executing the line `sm = sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, the value of `sm` is updated to be the remainder when `sm` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], suf[2], ..., suf[n])]`, `sm` is `(2 + suf[n]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `sm` is now the remainder of `(2 + suf[n])` divided by \(10^9 + 7\), while `suf` and `smin` remain unchanged.
