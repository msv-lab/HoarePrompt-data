Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is the first integer read from the input.
- `b` is the second integer read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'yes'`. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **yes**
