Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, and `b` is the second integer read from the input. At least one of `a` or `b` is odd, and neither `2a` equals `b` nor `2b` equals `a`. The difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero, meaning `(a - b) % 2` is either greater than 0 or less than 0.**
