### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. From these two smaller rectangles, he wants to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one (considering rotations as the same).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Even Dimensions**: If both \( a \) and \( b \) are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle.
2. **Identical Dimensions**: If \( a = b \), Bob cannot form a new rectangle because the two smaller rectangles will be \( a \times 1 \) or \( 1 \times a \), which can only form the same \( a \times a \) rectangle.
3. **One Even Dimension**: If either \( a \) or \( b \) is even, Bob can form a new rectangle. For example, if \( a \) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles and form a new rectangle of size \( b \times a \).

#### Analysis of Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program before and after processing each test case.
- The logic described in the annotations matches the code, but we need to verify if it aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Condition for Identical Dimensions**:
   ```python
   elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
       print('no')
   ```
   - This condition is syntactically incorrect and logically flawed. It should simply be `elif a == b:`.

2. **Condition for Odd Differences**:
   ```python
   elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   - This condition is incorrect. It checks if the difference is odd, but the logic is flawed. The correct condition should be checking if the difference is non-zero and one of the dimensions is divisible by 2.

3. **Default Case**:
   ```python
   else:
       print('no')
   ```
   - This default case is too broad and doesn't cover all scenarios correctly.

#### Correct Logic:
- If \( a == b \), output `No`.
- If either \( a \) or \( b \) is even, output `Yes`.
- Otherwise, output `No`.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        elif a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Evaluation:
- The provided program does not handle all cases correctly.
- Specifically, the conditions for checking identical dimensions and odd differences are incorrect.
- The original assessment correctly identifies these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
