Output State: **All `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the program has printed either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions specified.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have completed, the program will have processed each of the `t` test cases. For each test case, it checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it further checks if splitting the even number into two halves results in a number different from the other variable (`b` or `a` respectively). If these conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'. If neither `a` nor `b` is even, or if the split results in a number equal to the other variable, it prints 'No'. The value of `t` will have been decremented to zero, indicating that all test cases have been handled.
