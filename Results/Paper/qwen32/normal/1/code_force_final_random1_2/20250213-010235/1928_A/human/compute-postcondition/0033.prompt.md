Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
        print('yes')
    elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
        print('no')
    elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, and `b` is the second integer read from the input. If both `a` and `b` are even, then the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` holds. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero, meaning `(a - b) % 2` is either greater than 0 or less than 0. If `a` is equal to `b`, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. Additionally, if `a - b == -a` and `a` is the current value, or `b - a == -b` and `b` is the current value, then the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, neither `2a` equals `b` nor `2b` equals `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1. Whether the if condition (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`) is met or not, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, and `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1. Regardless of whether both `a` and `b` are even, `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
