Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

Bob starts with a rectangle of size `a x b`. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. After cutting, he tries to form a new rectangle using the two resulting pieces. The new rectangle should have different dimensions compared to the original one (i.e., not just a 90-degree rotation).

### Key Observations:

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles.
   - If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles.
   
2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - After cutting, Bob can combine the two resulting rectangles to form a new rectangle.
   - For the new rectangle to be different from the original one, the dimensions of the new rectangle must not be `(a, b)` or `(b, a)`.

### Conditions for "Yes":

- If `a` is even, the new rectangle can be `(a/2, 2*b)` or `(2*b, a/2)`, which is different from `(a, b)` unless `a/2 == b`.
- If `b` is even, the new rectangle can be `(a, b/2)` or `(b/2, a)`, which is different from `(a, b)` unless `b/2 == a`.

### Conditions for "No":

- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

### Program Analysis:

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                (a1, a2) = (a // 2, a // 2)
                if a1 != b:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            if b % 2 == 0:
                (b1, b2) = (b // 2, b // 2)
                if b1 != a:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            print('No')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Issues in the Program:

1. **Logic for Even Dimensions:**
   - The program checks if `a` is even and then checks if `a/2 != b`. However, this is not sufficient. It should check if the new dimensions `(a/2, 2*b)` or `(2*b, a/2)` are different from `(a, b)`.
   - Similarly, it checks if `b` is even and then checks if `b/2 != a`. Again, this is not sufficient. It should check if the new dimensions `(a, b/2)` or `(b/2, a)` are different from `(a, b)`.

2. **Simplified Condition:**
   - The program can be simplified by checking if either `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, the answer is "Yes" unless the resulting dimensions after cutting are the same as the original dimensions.

### Correct Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases due to insufficient checks for forming a new rectangle. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
