Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, and `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true because `(a - b) % 2` can never be 0, so the if part is always executed, and `i` is incremented by 1 regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.**
