### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
The goal is to determine if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a different rectangle. Key points:
1. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, it's possible to form a new rectangle.
2. If either \(a\) or \(b\) is odd, the difference \(|a - b|\) must be even to form a new rectangle.
3. If \(a == b\), no new rectangle can be formed because the only possible cuts would result in squares.

#### Program Analysis:
Here is the provided code with annotations:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`**:
   - This condition is incorrect. It evaluates to a tuple and does not make logical sense. It should be checking if `a == b`.
   
2. **Condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`**:
   - This condition is always true for any non-zero \(a - b\). The correct condition should check if the absolute difference is even, i.e., `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.

3. **Handling `a == b`**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the case where \(a == b\). It should explicitly check for this condition and return 'no'.

#### Corrected Logic:
- If \(a \% 2 == 0\) and \(b \% 2 == 0\), print 'yes'.
- If \(a == b\), print 'no'.
- If \(abs(a - b) \% 2 == 0\) and not both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, print 'yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'no'.

### Evaluation Based on Annotations:
Let's use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.

1. **First Condition (`if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`)**:
   - This condition is correct. If both dimensions are even, it is possible to form a new rectangle.

2. **Second Condition (`elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`)**:
   - This condition is incorrect. It should be checking if \(a == b\).

3. **Third Condition (`elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`)**:
   - This condition is incorrect. It should be checking if \(abs(a - b) \% 2 == 0\).

4. **Else Condition**:
   - This condition is correct in the sense that it handles the remaining cases, but the logic needs to be adjusted based on the corrected conditions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the program. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
