The code snippet assigns `b1` and `b2` the value of `b // 2`. This means that both `b1` and `b2` are now equal to half of `b` (integer division).

Output State: **`t` is an integer that was initially read from input minus 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input. If `a` is even, then `a1` and `a2` are both set to `a // 2`, provided `a1` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is odd, no changes are made to `a1` and `a2`. `b1` and `b2` are both equal to `b // 2`.**
