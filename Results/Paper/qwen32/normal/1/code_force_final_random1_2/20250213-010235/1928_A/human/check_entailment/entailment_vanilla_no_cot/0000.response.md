Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob can cut an `a x b` rectangle into two smaller rectangles and try to form a new rectangle from them. The key points are:
- If both `a` and `b` are even, he can always form a new rectangle.
- If `a` and `b` are not both even, he can form a new rectangle unless `a == b`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Condition for Both Even Sides:**
   - `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` This part is correct. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.

2. **Condition for Equal Sides:**
   - `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` This condition is incorrect. It seems like an attempt to check if `a == b`, but the syntax is wrong. The expression `(a - b == -a, a)` evaluates to a tuple, not a boolean value. The correct way would be `elif a == b:`.

3. **Condition for Odd Differences:**
   - `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` This condition is also incorrect. `(a - b) % 2` will never be greater than 0 and less than 0 at the same time. The correct logic should be checking if the difference is non-zero and if either `a` or `b` is even.

4. **Default Case:**
   - `else: print('no')`: This is not correctly handling all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. Specifically, it doesn't handle cases where one dimension is even and the other is odd.

### Correct Logic:
- If `a == b`, print 'no'.
- If either `a` or `b` is even, print 'yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'no'.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        elif a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **False**
