The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, the code does not affect `t` or `i`. Therefore, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1.**
