Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input minus 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
- `a1` is calculated as `a // 2`.
- `a2` is also calculated as `a // 2`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. This output does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, or `a2`. These variables are defined based on the input but are not used in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of the variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
