### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
   - Initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - Iterates through possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each `x`, it iterates through possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - Checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Prints the count `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Issues with the Code:

- **Incorrect Pair Counting**: The logic inside `func_1()` is flawed. It incorrectly counts pairs based on the condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and the bounds \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). However, it does not properly account for all pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\).
  
- **Misleading Comment**: The comment in `func_1()` suggests that it counts pairs where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), which is not sufficient to solve the problem. The problem requires checking the divisibility condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\) for all pairs \((a, b)\).

- **Inefficient Looping**: The nested loops in `func_1()` do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\) efficiently. They only consider pairs where `x` and `y` are relatively prime and satisfy specific bounds, which is not equivalent to the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
