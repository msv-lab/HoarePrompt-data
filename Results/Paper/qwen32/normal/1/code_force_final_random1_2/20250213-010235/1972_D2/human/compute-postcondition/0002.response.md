To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables or the overall state of the program.

However, assuming `func_1()` does not modify `t` (as no specific behavior is provided), the output state would remain unchanged regarding `t`.

Given the lack of definition for `func_1()`, we can only conclude that `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**.
