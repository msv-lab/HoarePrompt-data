### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summaries against the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function appears to be designed to count valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Function Summaries:
- `func_2`: Reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case. The summary incorrectly suggests that the function returns a sum related to the first `t` natural numbers, which is not relevant to the problem.

#### Issues in `func_1`:
- **Loop Conditions**: The loops iterate over `x` and `y` with conditions `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. These conditions do not ensure that all pairs \((a, b)\) within the ranges \([1, n]\) and \([1, m]\) are checked.
- **Counting Logic**: The counting logic inside the loop uses `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, which does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). This logic seems to be an attempt to optimize the counting process but fails to accurately reflect the problem requirements.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, as it might miss valid pairs due to the incorrect loop conditions.

#### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the ranges \([1, n]\) and \([1, m]\) and checking the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` for each pair. This ensures that all potential cases are handled correctly.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
