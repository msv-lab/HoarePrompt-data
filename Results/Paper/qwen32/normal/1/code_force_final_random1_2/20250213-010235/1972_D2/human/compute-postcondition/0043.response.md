The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `y` is 1, `y` now becomes 2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` (which is 3) and the new `y` (which is 2) is still 1, as 3 and 2 are coprime. The values of `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 12, `m` must be at least 4, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1. Additionally, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
