### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Given Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

- **`func_1`**: This function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), then iterates through values of \(x\) and \(y\) under certain conditions. It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and updates a counter based on a specific formula.
- **`func_2`**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Annotations:
Annotations provide insights into the state of the program at various points:
- Before `func_1` is called, \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers within the specified range.
- Inside `func_1`, the loop conditions and the counting logic are described.
- After processing a test case, the result is printed.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because:
1. The loop conditions do not cover all pairs \((a, b)\).
2. The counting logic is flawed.
3. Edge cases are not handled properly.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:
1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\).
   - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).

   These conditions significantly restrict the pairs \((x, y)\) being considered. For instance, if \(x = 1\), the inner loop will run as long as \(y \leq n\) and \(y \leq \frac{m}{x + y}\). This does not cover all pairs \((a, b)\) within the full ranges of \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Counting Logic**:
   - The counter `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` when \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).

   This logic attempts to count pairs based on a specific relationship but does not directly check all pairs \((a, b)\) for the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program might miss valid pairs due to the restrictive loop conditions.

#### Correctness Verification:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\) for each pair. Instead, it uses a more restricted approach that fails to cover all necessary pairs.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all pairs \((a, b)\) within the ranges \([1, n]\) and \([1, m]\) and checking the condition directly, as shown in the corrected version provided in the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
