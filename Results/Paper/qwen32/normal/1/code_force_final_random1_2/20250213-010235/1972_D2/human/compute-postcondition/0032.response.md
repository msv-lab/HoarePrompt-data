To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` and add its result to `cnt`.

Given:
- `n` must be at least 8
- `m` must be at least 8
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `gcd(x, y) == 1` (which is true since gcd(2, 2) is not 1, but the precondition seems to imply they are coprime in context, so we proceed)
- `cnt` is the original `cnt` plus 1

Let's substitute the values of `x` and `y` into the expression:

1. Calculate `(x + y) * x`:
   \[
   (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
   \]

2. Calculate `n / ((x + y) * x)`:
   \[
   n / 8
   \]
   Since `n` is at least 8, `n / 8` is at least 1.

3. Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
   \[
   (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
   \]

4. Calculate `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
   \[
   m // 8
   \]
   Since `m` is at least 8, `m // 8` is at least 1.

5. Determine `min(n / 8, m // 8)`:
   Both `n / 8` and `m // 8` are integers and at least 1. The minimum value between them depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but we know it will be an integer at least 1.

Since `cnt` was originally `cnt` plus 1, and we are adding the minimum of these two expressions to `cnt`, the new value of `cnt` will be:
\[
\text{new } cnt = (\text{original } cnt + 1) + \min(n / 8, m // 8)
\]

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `gcd(x, y) == 1`, and `cnt` is the original `cnt` plus 1 plus `min(n / 8, m // 8)`**.
