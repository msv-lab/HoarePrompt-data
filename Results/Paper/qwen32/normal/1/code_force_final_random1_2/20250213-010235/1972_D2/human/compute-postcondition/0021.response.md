The value of `y` is explicitly set to 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `m` is an integer, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` up to the original `y`.**
