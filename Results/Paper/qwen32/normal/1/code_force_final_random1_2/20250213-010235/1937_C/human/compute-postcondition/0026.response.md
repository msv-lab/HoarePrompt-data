Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the value of `t` converted from input(), `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`, or `i` if `res` is `'<'` and `i` is greater than the current `k`, or 1 if no such index exists, `best` is `i` if `res` is `'<'` and `i` is greater than the current `k`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged, and `res` is the value of the user input.**
