Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement contains several components: `'?'`, `0`, `k`, `0`, and `i`.
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `0` is a literal integer.
- `k` is explicitly given as 1.
- `0` is another literal integer.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown based on the given information.

Given the lack of definition for `i`, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will describe it as `i` in the output.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the literal string `'?'`, followed by the integers `0`, `1` (the value of `k`), `0` again, and then the undefined variable `i`.

Output: **? 0 1 0 i (where i is an undefined variable)**
