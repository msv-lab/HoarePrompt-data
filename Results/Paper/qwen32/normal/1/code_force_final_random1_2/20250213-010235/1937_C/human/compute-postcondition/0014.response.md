To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `k` is `i + 1` if `res` equals `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1.
- `res` is the string input by the user.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop statement, we know that `i` starts from 2 and goes up to (but does not include) `n`. At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the current value of `i` plus 1. Since the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `n`, `n` does not need to be changed unless it was modified within the loop body, which it isn't according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop head or based on the given information.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `i + 1` if `res` equals `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1, `res` is the string input by the user, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, and `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, we update `i` accordingly:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, to be more precise and considering all given conditions, the most accurate state representation at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `i + 1` if `res` equals `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1, `res` is the string input by the user, `i` is `i + 1`**.

But focusing only on the loop head variables:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` from the previous state. Therefore, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it would be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

Let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration for concreteness:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is 4 if `res` equals `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1, `res` is the string input by the user, `i` is 4**.

However, sticking strictly to the loop head variables:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 4**.

Generalizing this for any `i`:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`**.

So the final answer is:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`**.
