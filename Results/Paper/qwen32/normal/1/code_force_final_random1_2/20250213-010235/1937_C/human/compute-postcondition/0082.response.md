Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
2. `n` must be at least 3.
3. `k` is 1.
4. `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement contains a mix of fixed values and variables.
- `'?'` is a fixed string.
- `0` is a fixed integer.
- `k` is explicitly given as 1.
- `0` is another fixed integer.
- `i` is a variable that is not explicitly defined in the initial state.

Given that `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we need to consider the context or assume that `i` might be a placeholder or a variable that should be defined elsewhere in the code.

However, based on the provided information, we can still describe the output with the known values and the unknown `i`.

### Output Description:
- The string `'?'` will be printed.
- The integer `0` will be printed.
- The value of `k` which is `1` will be printed.
- Another integer `0` will be printed.
- The value of `i` will be printed, but since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value.

Thus, the output will be a sequence of these values separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 1 0 i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
