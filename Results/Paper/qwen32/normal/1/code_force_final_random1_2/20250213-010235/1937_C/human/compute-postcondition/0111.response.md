To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `res` is the new input string, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` holds the value after incrementing.
- `k` and `best` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown from the given information.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Here’s the breakdown of the output:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is a variable whose value is unknown.
- `best` is another variable whose value is unknown.
- `k` is repeated in the print statement, so it will appear twice.
- `i` is the incremented value, which means it holds the value after being incremented by 1.

Since the values of `k` and `best` are not specified, we can only describe them as variables with unknown values.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [k] [best] [k] [i] (where k and best are unknown variables and i is the value after being incremented by 1)**
