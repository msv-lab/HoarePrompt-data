The value of `k` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `n` and `res` remain unchanged. Since `i` was initially described as `i + 1`, it retains that form unless further operations are performed on it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `res` is an input value, `k` is `i + 1`**.
