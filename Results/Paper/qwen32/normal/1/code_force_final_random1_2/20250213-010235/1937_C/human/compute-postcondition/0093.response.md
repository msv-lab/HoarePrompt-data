To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n`: At least 3.
   - `k`: Defined as `i` if `res` equals `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1.
   - `best`: The largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was `<`, or 0 if no such response was received.
   - `res`: The input string.
   - `i`: Incremented by 1.

2. **Current State:**
   - The value of `t` is not explicitly given but it's within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - The value of `n` is at least 3.
   - The value of `k` depends on the previous value of `i` and the value of `res`. If `res` was `<`, then `k` would be the previous value of `i`; otherwise, `k` remains 1.
   - The value of `best` is the largest index `i` where the response was `<`, or 0 if no such response was received.
   - The value of `res` is the input string.
   - The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

This `print` statement will output a string starting with `'?'` followed by the values of `0`, `k`, `0`, and `i`.

### Determining the Values:
- The first argument is a literal string `'?'`.
- The second argument is `0`.
- The third argument is `k`, which depends on the previous state of `i` and the value of `res`. Since the exact value of `k` isn't specified, we'll represent it as `k`.
- The fourth argument is `0`.
- The fifth argument is `i`, which is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Since the exact value of `i` isn't specified, we'll represent it as `i`.

### Final Output:
Based on the analysis, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **? 0 k 0 i (where k is the value determined by the previous state of i and res, and i is the current incremented value of i)**
