The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, meaning `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by another 1 from its current value (which was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).

Given that `n` is greater than 2, for the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Let's summarize the adjustments needed:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same as it is already defined to be greater than 2.

Therefore, if `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 2, `res` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 2`. If `res` is `'<'`, then `k` is set to `i` and `best` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `k` remains 1 and `best` retains its previous value.**
