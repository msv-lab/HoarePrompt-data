The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `k` is `i` if `res` equals '<', otherwise `k` remains 1.
- `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received.
- `res` is the input string.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. The variable `n` does not change within the loop.

Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `x` (where `2 ≤ x < n`). At the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is at least 3, `k` is `i` if `res` equals '<', otherwise `k` remains 1, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received, `res` is the input string, `i` is `x + 1`**.

To generalize, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is at least 3, `k` is `i` if `res` equals '<', otherwise `k` remains 1, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received, `res` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration isn't specified, we can express the state in terms of the incremented `i`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is at least 3, `k` is `i` if `res` equals '<', otherwise `k` remains 1, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received, `res` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1**.
