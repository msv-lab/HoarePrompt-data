The code snippet provided is `k = i`. However, the initial state does not specify what the value of `i` is. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact new value of `k`. Therefore, we can only state that `k` will take the value of `i`.

Given the initial state and the code, the updated state would be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `i`, `res` is the string input by the user, and `res` equals `<`.**

This means that `k` now holds the value of `i`, while all other variables retain their original values.
