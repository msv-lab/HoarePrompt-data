The code snippet reads an input and assigns it to the variable `res`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `best`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the largest index i (from 2 to n-1) where the response was '<', or 1 if no such response was received, `best` is 0, `res` is the input string.**
