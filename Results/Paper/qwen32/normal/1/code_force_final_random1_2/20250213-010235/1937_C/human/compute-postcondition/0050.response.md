The code snippet `res = input()` updates the value of the variable `res` with the input string provided by the user. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is the value of `res`, which now holds the new input string. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `i` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise `k` remains 1, `best` is the last index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`, `res` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.
