The code snippet `res = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `best` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is 1, `best` is the largest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received, `res` is the input string.**
