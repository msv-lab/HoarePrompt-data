Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; res is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `res` has been initialized to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
