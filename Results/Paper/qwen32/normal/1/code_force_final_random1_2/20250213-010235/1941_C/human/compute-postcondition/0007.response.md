The code snippet `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This changes the value of `a` from its initial state (which was the integer value read from the user input) to a new integer value read from the user input during the execution of this line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `a` is the new integer value read from the user input, `s` is the string value read from the user input, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`**.
