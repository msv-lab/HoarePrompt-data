The code snippet `a = int(input())` reads a new integer value from the user input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means the value of `a` changes to whatever integer the user inputs. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `a` is the new integer value read from the user input, `s` is the new string value read from the user input, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`**.
