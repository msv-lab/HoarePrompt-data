Reasoning:  
The provided program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in each test case's string and outputs their sum. However, this approach does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the possibility of removing characters to avoid forming these substrings.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would count one occurrence of "map" and one occurrence of "pie", resulting in an output of 2. However, by removing just two characters ('a' and 'p'), we can make the string "mie", which is beautiful. Therefore, the correct answer should be 2, but the program's logic does not guarantee this minimal removal.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears in the string, which involves more complex logic than simply counting the substrings.

Correctness: **False**
