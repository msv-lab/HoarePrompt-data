Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is a list of strings representing the input values, t is greater than 0, idx is n + 3, results is an empty list, n is the integer value of data[1], q is the integer value of data[2], a is a list of n + 1 elements where a[i] (for i from 3 to n + 2) holds the integer value of data[i], pf is a list of n + 1 elements where pf[i] (for i from 1 to n) holds the cumulative XOR of a[1] to a[i], mp is a dictionary mapping each unique pf[i] to a list of indices where it appears.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 5`, `results` is `['YES', 'YES']` if `x` equals 0 and `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, `results` is `['YES', 'NO']` if `x` equals 0, and `['NO']` if `x` does not equal 0. `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `n + 2`) holds the integer value of `data[i]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) holds the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique `pf[i]` to a list of indices where it appears, `l` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` does not exist in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` does not exist in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 7`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `n + 2`) holds the integer value of `data[i]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) holds the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique `pf[i]` to a list of indices where it appears, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` does not exist in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` does not exist in `mp`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` is `['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']` if it was initially `['YES', 'YES', 'YES']`, `['YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'YES']` if it was initially `['YES', 'NO', 'YES']`, or `['NO', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']` if it was initially `['NO', 'YES']`. Otherwise, `results` is `['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'NO']` if `x` equals 0 and `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, `results` is `['YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO']` if `x` equals 0, and `['NO', 'YES', 'NO']` if `x` does not equal 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 9`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `n + 2`) holds the integer value of `data[i]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) holds the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique `pf[i]` to a list of indices where it appears, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` does not exist in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` does not exist in `mp`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains the string 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
