The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `l`. This means `l` now holds the integer representation of the string at the position `idx` in the `data` list. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the variable `l` with its new value.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2 - n]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 1 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, and `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.**
