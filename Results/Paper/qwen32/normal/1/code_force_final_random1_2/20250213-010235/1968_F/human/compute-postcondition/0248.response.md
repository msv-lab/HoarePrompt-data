To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the code step-by-step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `data`: A list of strings representing the input values.
- `t`: Initialized to 0.
- `idx`: Represents the final position in `data` after processing all iterations.
- `results`: A list containing all 'YES'/'NO' responses for each query across all iterations, followed by an empty string after each set of queries.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet uses the `join` method to concatenate all elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). 

### Determining the Output:
- **`results` List**: This list contains 'YES'/'NO' responses for each query and is followed by an empty string after each set of queries. Since the exact contents of `results` are not specified, we need to describe the output in terms of its structure.

### Example Structure of `results`:
Assuming `results` might look something like this:
```python
results = ['YES', 'NO', 'YES', '', 'YES', 'YES', 'NO', '']
```
This would mean there were two sets of queries:
1. The first set had three queries: 'YES', 'NO', 'YES'.
2. The second set had three queries: 'YES', 'YES', 'NO'.

### Final Output:
When the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement is executed, it will print each element of the `results` list on a new line.

### Explanation:
- Each 'YES' or 'NO' response will appear on a separate line.
- An empty string in the `results` list will result in a blank line in the output.

### Conclusion:
Given the structure described above, the output will be a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses, each on a new line, with blank lines separating different sets of queries.

Output: **'YES\nNO\nYES\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\n' (where each 'YES'/'NO' is a response to a query and each empty string results in a blank line)**

However, since the exact contents of `results` are not provided, we describe the output in a general form:

Output: **'YES\nNO\n...\n\nYES\nNO\n...\n' (where each 'YES'/'NO' is a response to a query and each empty string results in a blank line, representing the structure of the `results` list)**
