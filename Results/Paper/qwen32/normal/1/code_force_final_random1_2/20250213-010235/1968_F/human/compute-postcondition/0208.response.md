The code snippet provided performs a binary search operation using `bisect.bisect_left` on the list `v1` to find the insertion point for the value `l`. This does not change the values of `data`, `t`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, or `v2`. It only introduces a new variable `it1` which holds the result of the binary search.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 6 + n`, `results` is a list containing `q + 3` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next element is `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4 - n]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 3 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order.**
