### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray can be divided into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.
   - Given a subarray `a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r`, we need to check if it can be partitioned into `k` parts with equal XOR values.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If a subarray `a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r` has an XOR of `x`, then for it to be interesting, there must exist indices `i` and `j` such that `l <= i < j <= r` and the XOR of `a_l, ..., a_i` equals the XOR of `a_{i+1}, ..., a_j` and so on.
   - This means that the cumulative XOR up to some point `i` within the subarray should repeat at least once before reaching `r`.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - **Prefix XOR Calculation:** The program calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) for the entire array. `pf[i]` represents the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array.
   - **Mapping Prefix XORs:** It uses a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this XOR value occurs.
   - **Query Handling:** For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a_l, ..., a_r` as `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
     - If `x == 0`, the subarray is trivially interesting because it can be divided into any number of parts with XOR `0`.
     - Otherwise, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[j] == pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]` and `l <= i < j <= r`. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the list of indices stored in `mp`.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The approach correctly identifies whether a subarray can be partitioned into parts with equal XOR values by leveraging prefix XORs and their occurrences.
   - The use of binary search ensures efficient querying of the prefix XOR indices, making the solution feasible within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
