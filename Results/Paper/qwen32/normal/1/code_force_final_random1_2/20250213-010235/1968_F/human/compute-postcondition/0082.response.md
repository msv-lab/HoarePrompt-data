Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 9`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `n + 2`) holds the integer value of `data[i]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) holds the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique `pf[i]` to a list of indices where it appears, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` does not exist in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` does not exist in `mp`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order, `results` contains the string 'YES'.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the string 'YES' has been appended to the `results` list. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
