Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 2`, `results` is a list containing one element which is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary mapping `0` to `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element which is an empty string, `n` is at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is `int(data[idx])` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list where `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list that includes `i` as one of its elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 4`, `results` is a list containing one element which is an empty string, `n` is at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index 1 is `int(data[idx - 1])` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list where `pf[1] = pf[0] ^ a[1]`, `i` is 1, `mp[pf[1]]` is `[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is `t - 1`; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 5`; `results` is a list containing one element which is an empty string; `n` is at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index 1 is `int(data[idx - 2])` and the element at index 2 is `int(data[idx - 1])`; all other elements are 0; `pf` is a list where `pf[1] = pf[0] ^ a[1]` and `pf[2] = pf[1] ^ a[2]`; `i` is 2; `mp[pf[1]]` is `[1]`; `mp[pf[2]]` is `[1, 2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
