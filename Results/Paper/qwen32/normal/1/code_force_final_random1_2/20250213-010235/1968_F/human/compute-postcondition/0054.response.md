Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 5`, `results` is `['YES', 'YES']` if `x` equals 0 and `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, `results` is `['YES', 'NO']` if `x` equals 0, and `['NO']` if `x` does not equal 0. `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `n + 2`) holds the integer value of `data[i]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) holds the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique `pf[i]` to a list of indices where it appears, `l` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` does not exist in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` does not exist in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**
