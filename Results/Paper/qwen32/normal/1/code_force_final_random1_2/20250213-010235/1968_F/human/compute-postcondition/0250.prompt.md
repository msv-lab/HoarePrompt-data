You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The array a contains n integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < 2^30. Each query is defined by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        
        idx += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = {(0): [0]}
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            if pf[i] not in mp:
                mp[pf[i]] = []
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
            v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
            it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
        results.append('')
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is 0, `idx` is the final position in `data` after processing all iterations, `results` is a list containing all 'YES'/'NO' responses for each query across all iterations, followed by an empty string after each set of queries.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: 'YES\nNO\n...\n\nYES\nNO\n...\n' (where each 'YES'/'NO' is a response to a query and each empty string results in a blank line, representing the structure of the `results` list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a` and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The array `a` contains `n` integers, each between 0 and 2^30 - 1. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 <= l < r <= n). The function returns the result of each query, which is typically some computed value based on the subarray `a[l-1:r]`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
