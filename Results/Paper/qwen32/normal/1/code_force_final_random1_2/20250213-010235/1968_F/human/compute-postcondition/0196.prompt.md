Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 4`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions checked in each iteration, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, and `mp` is `{(0): [0]}`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values where `data[idx - 3]` is a string representing an integer that is at least 1, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 5`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions checked in each iteration, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, and now `mp[pf[i]]` includes the index `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values where `data[idx - 3]` is a string representing an integer that is at least 1, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 6`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions checked in each iteration, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, and `mp[pf[i]]` now includes `i`, `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 7`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 5]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary with keys as unique values of `pf[i]` and values as lists of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, and `mp[pf[i]]` now includes `i`. `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
