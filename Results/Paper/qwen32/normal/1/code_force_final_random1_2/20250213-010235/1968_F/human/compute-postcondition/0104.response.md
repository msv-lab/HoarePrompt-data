The code snippet increments the value of `idx` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `idx` is calculated as `n + 3 + 2*q + 3`. After executing `idx += 1`, the new value of `idx` will be `n + 3 + 2*q + 4`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 4`, `results` is a list containing one element which is an empty string, `n` is at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index 1 is `int(data[idx - 1])` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list where `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list that includes `i` as one of its elements, `i` is 1**.
