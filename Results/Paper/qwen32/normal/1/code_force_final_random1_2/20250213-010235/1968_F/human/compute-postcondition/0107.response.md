Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 4`, `results` is a list containing one element which is an empty string, `n` is at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index 1 is `int(data[idx - 1])` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list where `pf[1] = pf[0] ^ a[1]`, `i` is 1. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[1]]` is an empty list.**
