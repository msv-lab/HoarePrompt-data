### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a subarray can be divided into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is equal. The provided solution attempts to solve this by using prefix XORs and a map to track occurrences of these prefix XOR values.

Here's a breakdown of the approach used in the code:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The code calculates the prefix XOR for the array up to each index. This allows quick computation of the XOR of any subarray.
   
2. **Map for Prefix XOR Values**: It maintains a map (`mp`) where keys are prefix XOR values and values are lists of indices at which these prefix XOR values occur. This helps in quickly finding indices where a particular prefix XOR value appears.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, it computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1:r]` using the prefix XOR values. If this XOR is zero, it immediately returns 'YES' because the entire subarray itself satisfies the condition.

4. **Checking for Valid Segments**: If the XOR is not zero, it checks if there exist indices within the range `[l, r]` where the prefix XOR value equals `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. This indicates that there is a subarray within `[l, r]` whose XOR is equal to the XOR of the entire subarray, which could potentially be split into equal XOR segments.

5. **Binary Search**: It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to efficiently find the relevant indices in the list of indices stored in the map.

The key point here is that the solution checks for the existence of a subarray within the given range whose XOR matches the XOR of the entire subarray. If such a subarray exists, it implies that the original subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values, satisfying the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values. Therefore, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **True**
