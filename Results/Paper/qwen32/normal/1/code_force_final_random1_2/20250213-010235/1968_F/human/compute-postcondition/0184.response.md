Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values where `data[idx - 3]` is a string representing an integer that is at least 1, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 6`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions checked in each iteration, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, and now `mp[pf[i]]` includes the index `i`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The only variable that changes due to the code snippet is `idx`, which is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
