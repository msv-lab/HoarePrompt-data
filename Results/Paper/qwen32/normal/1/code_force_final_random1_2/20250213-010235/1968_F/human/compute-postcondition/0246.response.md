The code snippet appends an empty string to the `results` list. This means the length of the `results` list increases by one, and the new last element is an empty string.

Given the initial state, the `results` list originally contains `2*q + 2` elements. After appending another empty string, the `results` list now contains `2*q + 3` elements.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 6*q + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing `2*q + 3` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `2*q + 1` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last two elements are empty strings, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2 - n]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3 - n]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 1 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs.**
