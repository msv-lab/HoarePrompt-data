The code snippet `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `l` in the sorted list `v1`. This does not change the values of `v1` or `l`, but it assigns the result to a new variable `it1`.

Here's the updated state of the variables after executing the code:

- `data` remains a list of strings representing the input values.
- `t` remains `t - 1`.
- `idx` remains `2*n + 3 + 2*q + 4`.
- `results` remains a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, otherwise `results` remains a list containing one element which is an empty string.
- `n` remains the integer value of `data[n + 3]`.
- `q` remains greater than 0.
- `a` remains a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - (n - i + 1)])` and all other elements are 0.
- `pf` remains a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
- `mp` remains a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key.
- `l` remains the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- `r` remains the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.
- `x` remains `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
- `v1` remains the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`.
- `v2` remains the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`.
- `it1` is assigned the value of the insertion point for `l` in the sorted list `v1`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is t - 1, `idx` is 2*n + 3 + 2*q + 4, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, otherwise `results` remains a list containing one element which is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of n + 1 elements where the element at index i (for i from 1 to n) is `int(data[idx - (n - i + 1)])` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list of n + 1 elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in the sorted list `v1`.**
