The code snippet converts the element at index `idx` of the `data` list to an integer and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `idx` is 1, so `n` will be the integer representation of the second element in the `data` list.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
