Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 2 + int(g / count) + 1`; `i` is 1; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `int(n / 3) - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
