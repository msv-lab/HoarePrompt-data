### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\),
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\),
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the constraints, the solution must be efficient enough to handle up to 10,000 test cases with \(n\) and \(m\) up to 2 million.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem using a loop that iterates through possible values of \(b\) (denoted as `count` in the code). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read.
   - `count` is initialized to 2 (since \(b=1\) is trivially handled separately).
   - `ans` is initialized to `n` (since for \(b=1\), every \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) is a valid pair).

2. **Loop through possible values of \(b\)**:
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - For each `count`, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - It then calculates `g` as the integer division of `n` by `count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` from it.
   - It increments `ans` by the integer division of `g` by `count` plus 1.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, the value of `ans` is printed.

#### Issues in the Code:
Upon closer inspection, the logic used in the code does not correctly implement the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Specifically:

- The calculation of `g` and its subsequent use does not align with the problem's requirements.
- The loop's termination condition and the way `g` is updated do not ensure that all valid pairs \((a, b)\) are counted.

#### Correct Approach:
A more straightforward approach would involve iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition directly. However, due to the large constraints, optimizations are necessary. One possible optimization involves iterating through divisors of \(b\) and using properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
