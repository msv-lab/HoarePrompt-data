Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n`; `i` is 1; `countmins` is 1; `g` is equal to `int(n / count)`; and `g` is less than `countmins`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. Thus, all the variables retain their initial values, and the only new information is that the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.
