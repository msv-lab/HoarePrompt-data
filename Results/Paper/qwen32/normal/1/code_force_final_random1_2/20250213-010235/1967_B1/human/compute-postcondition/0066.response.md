The given code snippet assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. This means that the previous value of `ans` is overwritten by the value of `n`.

Here is the updated state:

- `t` must be at least 2 (unchanged).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input (unchanged).
- `m` is an integer obtained from the input (unchanged).
- `count` is 2 (unchanged).
- `ans` is now equal to `n`.
- `i` is 2 (unchanged).

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `i` is 2.**
