Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Key Points:
- The code initializes `ans` to `n`, which accounts for the pairs where `b=1`. This is because for any `a` from 1 to `n`, the pair `(a, 1)` will always satisfy the condition since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is trivially a multiple of \(1\).
- It then iterates over possible values of `b` starting from 2 up to `m`.
- For each `b`, it calculates `g` as `int(n / b)`, which represents the maximum value of `a` such that `a/b` is an integer.
- It then adjusts `g` by subtracting `countmins` (which is `b-1`), and adds the result divided by `b` plus one to `ans`.

#### Issues:
- The logic for calculating the number of valid pairs for `b > 1` seems flawed. The calculation does not correctly account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The loop and calculations do not properly consider the relationship between `a`, `b`, and their gcd.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the code with the provided example:

For the test case `n=10`, `m=8`:
- The correct pairs are: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2).
- The code's output for this case is `14`, which matches the expected result. However, this does not prove the correctness of the code for all cases.

### Conclusion

Given the complexity of the problem and the specific logic required to solve it, the provided code does not seem to implement the correct algorithm. The logic for counting valid pairs for `b > 1` appears incorrect and does not properly handle the gcd condition.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
