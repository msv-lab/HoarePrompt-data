Given the code snippet `g = int(n / count)`, the value of `g` will be updated based on the current values of `n` and `count`. The initial state provides that `count` is 3.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 2`; `i` is 2; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `int(n / 3)`**.

Here, `g` is recalculated as `int(n / 3)` because `count` is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
