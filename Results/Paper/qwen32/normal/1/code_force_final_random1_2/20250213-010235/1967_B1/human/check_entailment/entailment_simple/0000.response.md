Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem statement to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis:
The code iterates through each test case and calculates the number of valid pairs for given \(n\) and \(m\). Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the code logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `count` is initialized to 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which accounts for all pairs where \(b = 1\).

2. **Loop through possible values of \(b\)**:
   - The loop runs from `count = 2` to `count = m`.
   - For each `count` (which represents \(b\)):
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks because no more valid pairs can be found for larger \(b\).
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - The number of valid pairs for this \(b\) is added to `ans`. This is calculated as `int(g / count) + 1`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all possible \(b\) values, the result `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify if the logic correctly counts the number of valid pairs:

- **Base Case (\(b = 1\))**: All pairs \((a, 1)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) are valid since \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\). Thus, there are `n` such pairs, which is correctly initialized to `ans`.

- **General Case (\(b > 1\))**: The code calculates the number of valid pairs for each \(b\) by considering the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The logic seems to be derived from counting multiples within the range, but it needs careful verification.

However, the provided code does not seem to correctly implement the logic for all cases. Specifically, the calculation of `g` and the adjustment by `countmins` might not accurately reflect the number of valid pairs for each \(b\).

### Conclusion:
Upon closer inspection, the logic in the provided code does not fully align with the problem requirements. The calculation of valid pairs for \(b > 1\) appears flawed, and the code does not correctly account for all valid pairs.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
