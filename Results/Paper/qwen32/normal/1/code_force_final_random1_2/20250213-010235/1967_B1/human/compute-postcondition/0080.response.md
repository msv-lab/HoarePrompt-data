Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 2; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1`; `i` is 2; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `int(n / 3)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
