`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n` and `m`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6; the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.**
