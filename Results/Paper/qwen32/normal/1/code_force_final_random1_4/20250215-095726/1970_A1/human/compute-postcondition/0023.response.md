To determine the output of the `print(result)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step-by-step:

1. **String `s`**: It is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
   - Example: `"(()())"`

2. **Length `n`**: This is the length of the string `s`.
   - For example, if `s = "(()())"`, then `n = 6`.

3. **`balance_info`**: This is a sorted list of `n` elements, where each element is an instance of `BalanceInfo` containing:
   - `balance`: The cumulative balance of parentheses up to that point in the string.
     - "(" increases the balance by 1.
     - ")" decreases the balance by 1.
   - `index`: The position of the character in the string `s`.
   - `character`: The character at that index in the string `s`.
   
   The sorting criteria are:
   - First by `balance` in ascending order.
   - Second by `index` in descending order for elements with the same balance.

4. **`balance`**: This is initialized to 0 and is used to calculate the cumulative balance as we iterate through the string `s`.

5. **`result`**: This is a string formed by joining the characters from `balance_info` in the specified order.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

Let's take an example string `s = "(()())"` and walk through the process:

1. **Calculate `balance_info`**:
   - Initialize `balance = 0`.
   - Traverse the string `s` and calculate `balance_info`:
     - At index 0, `s[0] = '('`, `balance = 1`. `balance_info` entry: `(1, 0, '(')`.
     - At index 1, `s[1] = '('`, `balance = 2`. `balance_info` entry: `(2, 1, '(')`.
     - At index 2, `s[2] = ')'`, `balance = 1`. `balance_info` entry: `(1, 2, ')')`.
     - At index 3, `s[3] = '('`, `balance = 2`. `balance_info` entry: `(2, 3, '(')`.
     - At index 4, `s[4] = ')'`, `balance = 1`. `balance_info` entry: `(1, 4, ')')`.
     - At index 5, `s[5] = ')'`, `balance = 0`. `balance_info` entry: `(0, 5, ')')`.

2. **Sort `balance_info`**:
   - Sort by `balance` in ascending order and by `index` in descending order for elements with the same balance:
     - Sorted `balance_info`: `[(0, 5, ')'), (1, 4, ')'), (1, 2, ')'), (2, 3, '('), (2, 1, '('), (1, 0, '(')]`

3. **Form `result`**:
   - Join the characters from `balance_info` in the sorted order:
     - Characters in order: `')', ')', ')', '(', '(', '('`
     - Resulting string: `"()))(("`

### Conclusion

Given the initial state and the steps above, the `result` string is formed by joining the characters from `balance_info` in the specified sorted order. Therefore, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be the rearranged string based on the `balance_info` sorting criteria.

Output: **result (where result is the string formed by joining the characters from `balance_info` in the specified order)**

For the specific example `s = "(()())"`, the output would be `"()))(("`. However, since the exact string `s` is not provided, we describe the output in general terms based on the given conditions.

Output: **result (where result is the string formed by joining the characters from `balance_info` in the specified order)**
