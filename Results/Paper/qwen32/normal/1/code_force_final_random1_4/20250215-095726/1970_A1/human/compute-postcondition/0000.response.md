The code assigns the variable `n` the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence, `n` will be the number of characters in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**
