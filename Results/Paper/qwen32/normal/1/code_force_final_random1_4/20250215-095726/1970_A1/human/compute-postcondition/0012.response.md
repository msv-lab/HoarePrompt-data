The code snippet increments the `balance` variable by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `balance` in `balance_info` is initially 0 (from `BalanceInfo(0, 0, s[0])`). After the increment, `balance` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `balance_info` is a list containing two elements `BalanceInfo(0, 0, s[0])` and `BalanceInfo(1, 1, s[1])`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
