The code snippet provided only reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `ar`, `res`, or `mex`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input; `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the loop completes; `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the `res` list.**
