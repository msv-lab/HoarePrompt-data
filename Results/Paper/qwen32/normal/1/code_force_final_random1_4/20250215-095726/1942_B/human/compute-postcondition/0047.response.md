Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element; `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `n - ar[i]`; `mex` is `n`. The current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.**
