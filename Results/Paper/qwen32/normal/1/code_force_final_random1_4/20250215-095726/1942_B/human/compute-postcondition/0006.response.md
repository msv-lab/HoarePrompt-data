The given code snippet assigns a value to `res[i]` based on the current values of `mex` and `ar[i]`. Specifically, `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`
- `mex` is `n`

After executing the line `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, the value of `res[i]` will be updated to `n - ar[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `mex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`; `mex` is `n`**.
