The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`. Since the loop iterates backwards from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`, and the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

Given that the loop runs from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`, if `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would terminate, and there would be no next iteration. Hence, we assume `i` was greater than `0` at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex`) are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged; `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

To make this more concrete, let's assume `i` was `5` at the end of the previous iteration. Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `4`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged; `i` is 4**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we express it in terms of `k`.

Final State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged; `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.
