The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`; `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`.**
