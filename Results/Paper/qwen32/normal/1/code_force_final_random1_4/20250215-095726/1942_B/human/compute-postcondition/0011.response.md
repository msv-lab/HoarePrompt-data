Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is `n - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains `n`, `i` is `i - 1`**

Explanation: The value of `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
