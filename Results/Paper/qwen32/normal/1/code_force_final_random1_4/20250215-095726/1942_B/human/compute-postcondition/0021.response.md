The code snippet provided only includes the line `n = int(input())`. This line reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. None of the other variables (`t`, `ar`, `res`, `mex`) are affected by this line.

Given the initial state, the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input. The values of `t`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with `len(ar)` elements; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` encountered during the loop.**
