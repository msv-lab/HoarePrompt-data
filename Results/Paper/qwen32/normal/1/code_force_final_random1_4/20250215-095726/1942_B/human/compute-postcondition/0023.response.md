The code snippet `res = [None] * n` initializes the list `res` with `n` elements, all set to `None`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, or `mex`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input; `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `None`; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` encountered during the loop.**
