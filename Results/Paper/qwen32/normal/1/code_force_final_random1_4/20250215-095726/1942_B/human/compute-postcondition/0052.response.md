The given code snippet modifies the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `ar` remains a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element.
- `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `mex - ar[i]`. This list is not modified by the current line of code.
- `mex` is now `mex - ar[i]`.
- `i` remains `len(ar) - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element; `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `mex - ar[i]`; `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`; `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**
