The given code modifies the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. The other variables remain unchanged except for `mex`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is now `mex - ar[i]`
- `mex` is unchanged initially
- `i` is `i + 1`

After executing `mex = mex - ar[i]`, the new value of `mex` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`; `mex` is now `mex - ar[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
