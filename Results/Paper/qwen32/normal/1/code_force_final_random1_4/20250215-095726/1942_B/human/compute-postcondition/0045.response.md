To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop's header:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here, the loop variable is `i`, and the range function depends on `ar` (the list of integers). The loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

### Analysis:
- **`i`**: This is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand since it is initialized by the `range` function.
- **`ar`**: The length of this list determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute at least once, `ar` must contain at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `ar` has at least one element so that `len(ar) - 1` is a valid starting point for the loop.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, `mex`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop's header alone.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `ar` has at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element; `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`; `mex` is `n`.**
