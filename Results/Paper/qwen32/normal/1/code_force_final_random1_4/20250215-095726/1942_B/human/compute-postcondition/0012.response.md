The code snippet modifies the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Given the initial conditions, the new value of `mex` will be `mex - ar[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `i - 1`**.

In natural language: The value of `mex` is now `mex - ar[i]`. All other variables retain their original values.
