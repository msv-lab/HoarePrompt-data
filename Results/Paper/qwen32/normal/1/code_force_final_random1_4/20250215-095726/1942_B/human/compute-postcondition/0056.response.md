The given code snippet modifies the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Given that `i` is initially set to `len(ar) - 3`, the value of `ar[i]` is `ar[len(ar) - 3]`. 

Since `res[len(ar) - 3]` was initially set to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, and now `mex` is being updated to `mex - ar[i]`, the new value of `mex` will be the same as `res[len(ar) - 3]`.

If `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]` was true before the operation, it remains true because `mex` is being set to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, which is a smaller value.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `mex` and the unchanged values of other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element; `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[len(ar) - 3]` set to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`; `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`; `i` is `len(ar) - 3`**.
