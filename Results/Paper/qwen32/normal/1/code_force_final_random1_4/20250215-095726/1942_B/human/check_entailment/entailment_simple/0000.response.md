### Reasoning:

The given problem requires constructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The MEX (minimum excludant) of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

The provided code attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array `a` in reverse order and calculating the corresponding elements of `p`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values with length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of `ar` in reverse order (`for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1)`).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, the constructed permutation `res` is printed.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The MEX should be updated correctly after placing each element in the permutation. The current implementation does not ensure that the MEX is recalculated properly after placing each element. Instead, it simply takes the minimum of the current MEX and the newly calculated value, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find a valid permutation `p` from the array `a`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
