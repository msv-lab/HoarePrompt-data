The given code snippet updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. No other variables are directly modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `res[i]` was previously defined as `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` remains `n`. However, the current line of code directly assigns `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`.

Therefore, the new value of `res[i]` is simply `mex - ar[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is now `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is unchanged, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
