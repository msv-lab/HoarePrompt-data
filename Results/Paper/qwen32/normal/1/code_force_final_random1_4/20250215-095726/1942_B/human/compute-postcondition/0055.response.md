Given the code snippet `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, let's determine the new state of the variables after its execution.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `mex - ar[i]`
- If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`
- `i` is `len(ar) - 3`

### Code Execution Impact:
The code updates the `i-th` element of the list `res` to be `mex - ar[i]`.

### Output State Calculation:
- The value of `res[i]` changes to `mex - ar[i]`.
- The value of `mex` might change if the condition `mex > mex - ar[i]` holds true, updating `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element; `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[len(ar) - 3]` set to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`; if `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`; `i` is `len(ar) - 3`**
