The code initializes a list `res` with `n` elements, all set to `None`. The values of `t` and `ar` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers read from the input; `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`.**
