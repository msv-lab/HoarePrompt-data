Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
Farmer John provides an array `a` of length `n`, and we need to construct a permutation `p` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Here, `MEX` stands for the Minimum EXcluded value, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array `a` in reverse order and constructing the permutation `p` as follows:

1. Initialize `mex` to `n`.
2. For each element `ar[i]` in the reversed array `a`, compute `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
3. Update `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.

### Potential Issues
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program does not maintain a set or a list to track which numbers have already been used in the permutation `p`. Instead, it relies solely on the `mex` variable, which is decremented without ensuring that the resulting `res[i]` is unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`.
2. **No Validation**: There is no validation to ensure that the constructed `p` is a valid permutation (i.e., all elements are unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`).

### Example to Demonstrate Incorrectness
Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

However, let's see how the provided program handles this input:

1. Initialize `mex` to 5.
2. Process `ar[4] = 2`: `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`.
3. Process `ar[3] = 1`: `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
4. Process `ar[2] = -2`: `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`.
5. Process `ar[1] = 1`: `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
6. Process `ar[0] = 1`: `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.

Resulting `res` array: `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is correct for this specific case.

However, consider another test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

But the provided program will produce:

1. Initialize `mex` to 5.
2. Process `ar[4] = 0`: `res[4] = 5 - 0 = 5`, `mex = min(5, 5) = 5`.
3. Process `ar[3] = 0`: `res[3] = 5 - 0 = 5`, `mex = min(5, 5) = 5`.
4. Process `ar[2] = 0`: `res[2] = 5 - 0 = 5`, `mex = min(5, 5) = 5`.
5. Process `ar[1] = 0`: `res[1] = 5 - 0 = 5`, `mex = min(5, 5) = 5`.
6. Process `ar[0] = 0`: `res[0] = 5 - 0 = 5`, `mex = min(5, 5) = 5`.

Resulting `res` array: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`, which is incorrect because `5` is not a valid value for the permutation `p` (values must be in the range `[0, 4]`).

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly those where the values in `a` lead to invalid permutations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The program does not ensure that the constructed permutation `p` is valid (i.e., all elements are unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`). It incorrectly calculates the MEX value without maintaining a set of used numbers.
