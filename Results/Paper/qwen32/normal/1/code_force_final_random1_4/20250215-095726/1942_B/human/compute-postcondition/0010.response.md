The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the list `ar`. Since the loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`
- `mex` is `n - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains `n`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value between `0` and `len(ar) - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, as long as it remains within the bounds of the loop.

Since the loop iterates backwards, the next value of `i` should be `i - 1`.

Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can express the state in terms of `i` being decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`, `mex` is `n - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains `n`, `i` is `i - 1`**
