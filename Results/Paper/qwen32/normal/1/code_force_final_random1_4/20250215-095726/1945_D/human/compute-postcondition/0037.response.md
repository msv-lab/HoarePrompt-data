Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 0; `na_frente` is at least 1; `pos_final` is an integer read from input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input; `v` is `na_frente - 3`; `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The value of `best` is updated to be the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
