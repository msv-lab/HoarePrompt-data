Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input, `v` is `v_end - 2`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` remains unchanged unless it was less than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` before this operation, in which case it is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The value of `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it was previously less than this new `total` value. All other variables remain unchanged.
