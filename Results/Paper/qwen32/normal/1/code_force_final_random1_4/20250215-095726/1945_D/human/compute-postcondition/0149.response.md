The code snippet `a = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. 

Given the initial state, the variables `custo`, `custos`, `i`, `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, and `nf` remain unchanged except for `a`.

Output State: **`custo` is 0; `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, including the newly appended value; `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`; `x` remains unchanged; `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`; `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`; `a_values` is an empty list; `b_values` is an empty list; `nf` is a list of substrings from the input; `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input; `b` remains unchanged.**
