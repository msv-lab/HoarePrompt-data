To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, we need to carefully examine the initial state provided and see if there is any mention of a variable `c`.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `custo` is 140
- `custos` is [50, 90, 120, 140]
- `i` is 3
- `x` remains unchanged (the value of `x` is not specified)
- `num_fila` is 5
- `max_p` is 2
- `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
- `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]

None of these variables match `c`. Since `c` is not defined or mentioned in the initial state, it is impossible to determine its value from the given information. Therefore, the code would result in a `NameError` because `c` is not defined.

However, since the task asks us to describe the output based on the given information, and there is no `c` defined, we can conclude that the variable `c` does not exist in the provided context.

Output: **NameError: name 'c' is not defined**
