The code appends the integer value of `y` to the `a_values` list. Since `a_values` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `a_values` will contain one element, which is `int(y)`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `custo` is still 0.
- `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, including the newly appended value.
- `i` is still `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `num_fila` is still `int(nf[0])`.
- `max_p` is still `int(nf[1])`.
- `b_values` is still an empty list.
- `nf` is still a list of substrings from the input.
- `a` is still a list of substrings obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element.
- `b` is still a list of substrings from the new input.

Output State: **`custo` is 0, `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, including the newly appended value, `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`, `a_values` is `[int(y)]`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input.**
