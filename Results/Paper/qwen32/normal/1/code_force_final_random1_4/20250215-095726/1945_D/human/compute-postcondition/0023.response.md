Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 0; `na_frente` is at least 1; `pos_final` is an integer read from input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input; `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `best` is 10; `v` is greater than `pos_final`; `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `total` has been updated to include the cost of passing through `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
