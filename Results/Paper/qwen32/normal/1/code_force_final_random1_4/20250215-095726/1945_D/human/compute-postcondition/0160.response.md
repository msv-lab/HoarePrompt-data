The only object in the loop head is the variable `y` from the iterable `b`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `y` and ensure that there are more elements in `b` for the loop to execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `custo` is 0
- `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition
- `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`
- `x` remains unchanged
- `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`
- `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`
- `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`
- `b_values` is a list containing the previous elements plus `int(y)`
- `nf` is a list of substrings from the input
- `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input
- `b` is a list of substrings from the new input that must have at least one element

Since `y` is the current element being processed in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must still have unprocessed elements. The value of `y` should be updated to the next element in `b`.

Let's assume that the current `y` was the `k`-th element of `b`. For the next iteration, `y` should be the `(k+1)`-th element of `b`.

State: **`custo` is 0, `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`, `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the previous elements plus `int(y)`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input that must have at least two elements, `y` is the next element in `b`**
