To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the variables involved.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`.
- For each iteration, it compares `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]`.
- If `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo`; otherwise, it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo`.
- `custos` keeps track of all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition.
- Variables like `i`, `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

### Iteration Progression:
- The loop starts with `y = num_fila - 1` and decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration until `y` reaches `max_p`.
- Therefore, the loop runs exactly `num_fila - max_p` times.

### Final Output State:
- After all iterations, `custo` will be the sum of the selected values from `a_values` and `b_values` based on the comparison condition.
- `custos` will contain all intermediate sums of `custo` after each addition.
- All other variables (`i`, `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`) will retain their initial values.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `num_fila = 5`
- `max_p = 2`
- `a_values = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
- `b_values = [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`

Loop iterations:
1. `y = 4`: `a_values[4] < b_values[4]` → `custo = 50`
2. `y = 3`: `a_values[3] < b_values[3]` → `custo = 50 + 40 = 90`
3. `y = 2`: `a_values[2] < b_values[2]` → `custo = 90 + 30 = 120`

Final `custo` after all iterations: `120`
`custos` after all iterations: `[50, 90, 120]`

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`custo` is 120, `custos` is [50, 90, 120], `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55], `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, and `b` is a list of substrings from the new input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `custo` holds the total sum of the selected values from `a_values` and `b_values` based on the comparison, `custos` stores these intermediate sums, and all other variables remain as they were initially.
