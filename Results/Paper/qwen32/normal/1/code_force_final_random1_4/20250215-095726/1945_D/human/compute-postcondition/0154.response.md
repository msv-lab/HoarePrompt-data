The code appends the integer value of `y` to the list `a_values`. Since `y` is the next element in the list `a`, and `a_values` already contains `[int(y)]`, appending `int(y)` again results in `a_values` having two identical elements.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `custo` remains 0.
- `custos` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the current operation.
- `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `num_fila` remains `int(nf[0])`.
- `max_p` remains `int(nf[1])`.
- `a_values` now contains `[int(y), int(y)]`.
- `b_values` remains an empty list.
- `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input.
- `a` remains a list of substrings obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element.
- `b` remains a list of substrings from the new input.
- `y` remains the next element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`custo` is 0, `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`, `a_values` is `[int(y), int(y)]`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, `y` is the next element in the list `a`.**
