The only object in the loop head is the variable `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If `b` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is the current element being processed, and `b_values` contains the previous elements plus `int(y)`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `b` must have at least one more element. The state of `y` should be updated to the next element in `b`.

State: **`custo` is 0, `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`, `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the previous elements plus `int(y)`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input that must have at least two elements, `y` is the next element in `b`**
