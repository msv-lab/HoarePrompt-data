The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the elements in the list `custos`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `c` and how it changes as the loop progresses.

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` was 140, which is the last element in the list `custos`. Since `c` takes on each value in `custos` sequentially, there are no more values left in `custos` for `c` to take on. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

However, if we were to hypothetically consider what the state would be if there were more elements in `custos`, we would increment the index of `custos` that `c` refers to. But since `140` is the last element, no further iterations are possible.

Given the current state and the loop structure, the loop will terminate after this iteration. Thus, there is no valid state for another iteration where `c` takes on a new value from `custos`.

State: **`custo` is 140, `custos` is [50, 90, 120, 140], `i` is 3, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]** (no change as the loop terminates)
