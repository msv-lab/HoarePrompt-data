Output State: **`custo` is 0; `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, including the newly appended value; `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`; `x` remains unchanged; `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`; `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`; `a_values` is an empty list; `b_values` is an empty list; `nf` is a list of substrings from the input; `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input; `b` is a list of substrings from the new input.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated to be a list of substrings from the new input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
