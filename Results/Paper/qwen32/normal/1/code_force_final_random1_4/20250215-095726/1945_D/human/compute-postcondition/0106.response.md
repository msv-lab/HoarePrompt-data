Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 2; `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0; `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `total` is 0; `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

In simple terms, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` (which is 0) and the element at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
