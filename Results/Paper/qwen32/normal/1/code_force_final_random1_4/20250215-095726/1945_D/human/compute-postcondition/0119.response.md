Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 2; `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0; `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current value of `best`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated similarly based on the comparison between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
