To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `y` in this case.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `y` in the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`, meaning `y` starts at `num_fila - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `max_p`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was decremented by 1, so we need to adjust `y` to the value it should have at the start of the next iteration.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Current Value of `y`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was decremented by 1.
2. **Next Value of `y`:** To find the value of `y` at the start of the next iteration, we simply need to add 1 to the current value of `y`.

Given that `y` is currently `y - 1` (from the problem statement), the value of `y` at the start of the next iteration would be `y`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `y`.

State: **`custo` is updated to `custo + a_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is updated to `custo + b_values[y]`. `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition. `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integer values from `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, and `b` is a list of substrings from the new input. `y` is `y`**
