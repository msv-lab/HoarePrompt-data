The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the elements in the list `custos`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `c` and how it changes in each iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `c` was 140, which is the last element in the list `custos`.
- The list `custos` contains the elements [50, 90, 120, 140].

Since `c` takes on each value in `custos` sequentially, and 140 is the last element in `custos`, there are no more elements left for `c` to take on. Therefore, the loop will not execute another iteration.

However, if we were to hypothetically continue and adjust the state as if there were another iteration, `c` would need to take on the next value in `custos` if it existed. Since there are no more values, the loop terminates.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration (which does not exist) would not change from the end of the previous iteration regarding the loop variable `c`.

State: **`custo` is 140, `custos` is [50, 90, 120, 140], `i` is 3, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]**
