The provided code snippet only declares a type variable `T` using `TypeVar('T')`. This declaration does not affect any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the introduction of the type variable `T`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; the second line contains a list v of n integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9; the third line contains a permutation p of n distinct integers from 1 to n; the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; T is a type variable.**
