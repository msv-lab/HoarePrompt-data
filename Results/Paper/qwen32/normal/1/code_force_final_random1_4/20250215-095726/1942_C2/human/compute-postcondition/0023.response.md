Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 4. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` is updated accordingly, and `tmp` may contain `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. If neither condition is met, `y`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.**
