Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles**: The logic for counting triangles is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that every pair of adjacent chosen vertices with a gap of 2 can form a triangle, which is not necessarily true. Additionally, the handling of gaps greater than 2 is also incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Circular Nature**: The program does not correctly handle the circular nature of the polygon. Specifically, the calculation involving `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is incorrect because it should consider the modulo operation to wrap around the polygon.

3. **Incorrect Use of `y`**: The program incorrectly uses the variable `y` to track the remaining vertices that can be chosen. It does not correctly account for the fact that adding a vertex can create multiple triangles.

4. **Incorrect Final Adjustment**: The final adjustment `ans += y` is incorrect because adding more vertices does not always directly translate to adding more triangles.

To solve this problem correctly, one needs to carefully consider how to place additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles while ensuring that the diagonals do not intersect. This involves a more complex algorithmic approach, possibly using dynamic programming or greedy strategies.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.
