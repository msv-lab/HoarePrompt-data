Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tt` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 1; `i` is 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to its previous value; `tmp` contains an additional element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; `y` is decreased by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2) - 1`. If neither condition is met, no updates occur to `ans`, `tmp`, `y`, or `ii`.**
