Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state after executing the code.

Initial State:
- `t` is 0
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `x` is the second integer read from the input
- `y` is `y - sum(i // 2 for i in val)`
- `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input and split by spaces, now sorted in ascending order with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it
- `val` is a list containing the value of `c` for each iteration from 1 to `x`, sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order
- `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and the original value of `cons`
- `sx` is `sx + sum(val)`

Code Snippet:
```python
cons = x + sx - 2
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `cons` is updated to `x + sx - 2`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input, `y` is `y - sum(i // 2 for i in val)`, `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and split by spaces, now sorted in ascending order with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing the value of `c` for each iteration from 1 to `x`, sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, `cons` is `x + sx - 2`, `sx` is `sx + sum(val)`**

In natural language:
- The variable `cons` is updated to the value of `x + sx - 2`.
- All other variables retain their initial values.
