Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, and `i` is 3. If `a[3] - a[2] == 2`, then `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus 1. Otherwise, if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `tmp` and `y` is updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
