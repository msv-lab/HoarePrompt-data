Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `tt` is greater than 0. `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 1. `i` is initially set to `len(a)`. `ans` is calculated as `x + y - 2`. `tmp` is an empty list. `y` is updated based on decrement operations. `ii` is incremented by 1. `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input. Additionally, the current value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is equal to 2.**
