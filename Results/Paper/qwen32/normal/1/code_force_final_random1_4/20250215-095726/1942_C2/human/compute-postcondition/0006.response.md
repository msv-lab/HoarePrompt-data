The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `tmp`. None of the other variables (`t`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.**
