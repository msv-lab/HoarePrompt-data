Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` contains all gaps greater than 0 and even (now sorted), `n` remains the first value provided in the input, `x` remains the second value provided in the input, `t` is decremented by `x`, `a` remains a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `st` remains a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `y` is `y - (sum of gap // 2 for all gaps in odd)`, `ans` is `x - 2 + k + (sum of all gaps in odd)`
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even that must contain at least one element, `n` remains the first value provided in the input, `x` remains the second value provided in the input, `t` is decremented by `x`, `a` remains a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `st` remains a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `ans` is increased by `gap`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0 and `ans` is `x - 2 + k + (sum of all gaps in odd) + 2 * y`. Otherwise, `y` remains `y - (sum of gap // 2 for all gaps in odd)` and `ans` remains `x - 2 + k + (sum of all gaps in odd)`. `y` is now `y - (gap // 2)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even that must contain at least one more element, `n` remains the first value provided in the input, `x` remains the second value provided in the input, `t` is decremented by `x`, `a` remains a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `st` remains a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `ans` is increased by `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`, `gap` is the next element in the `even` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even that must contain at least one more element, `n` remains the first value provided in the input, `x` remains the second value provided in the input, `t` remains the same as it was before the decrement, `a` remains the same as it was before the modification, `st` remains the same as it was before the update, `gap` is the next element in the `even` list, `ans` is now `ans + gap`, `y` is now `y - (gap // 2)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
