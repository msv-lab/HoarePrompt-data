To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is `j` in this case.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1.

Let's analyze the state adjustments required:

1. **Variable `j`:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the current value of `j` plus 1.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged according to the problem constraints.

Given that `j` is `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration should be `j + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`**.
