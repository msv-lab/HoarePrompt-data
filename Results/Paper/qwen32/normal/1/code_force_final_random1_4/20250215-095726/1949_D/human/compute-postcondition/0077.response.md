Postcondition: **`x` is the new input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` after all iterations, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n`. If the last character of `x` is 'S', `b[n]` is incremented by 1.**
