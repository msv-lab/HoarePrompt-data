Postcondition: **`nx` is a string, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[4][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` contains the character `xx[4][j - 1]`. If `xx[4][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is 'S' if either `i` or `j` is present in the slice `sb[:n // 4]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.**
