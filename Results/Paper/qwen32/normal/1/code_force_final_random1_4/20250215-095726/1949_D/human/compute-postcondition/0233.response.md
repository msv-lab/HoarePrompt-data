The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. This means that the value of `nx` will now include an additional 'F' at the end.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 2`, `nx` has an additional 'F' appended to its previous value.**
