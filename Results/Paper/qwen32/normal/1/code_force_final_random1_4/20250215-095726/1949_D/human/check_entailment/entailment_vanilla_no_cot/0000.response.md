Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly address the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not ensure that no matter the order of the scenarios, the player will never see more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type. The logic for filling in the '?' characters is flawed and does not consider the constraint on consecutive videos.

Here are some key issues:
1. The program uses a simple heuristic to fill in '?' characters based on whether a scenario has been assigned more 'F' or 'S' videos, but it does not guarantee the required constraint on consecutive videos.
2. The program does not account for the fact that the sequence of videos depends on the order of scenarios, and thus needs to ensure the constraint holds for all possible permutations.
3. The logic for choosing 'F' or 'S' for '?' characters is not robust enough to handle all edge cases and ensure the constraint is met.

To solve the problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach would be needed, possibly involving backtracking or dynamic programming to ensure the constraint is satisfied for all permutations of scenarios.
