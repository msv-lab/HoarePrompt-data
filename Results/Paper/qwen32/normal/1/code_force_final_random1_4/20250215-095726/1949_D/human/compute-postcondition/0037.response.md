The code snippet `a[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` of the array `a` by 1. Given the initial state, `a[j]` was incremented by 1 due to the presence of 'F' at index `j-1` of `x`. Since the code only modifies `a[j]`, other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` except `a[j]` which is incremented by 1, the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'F', `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a[j]` is incremented by 1.**
