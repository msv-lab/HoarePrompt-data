To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the variables.

Given:
- `i` is 5
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `j` is 2

Code snippet:
```python
nx += xx[i][j - 1]
```

This line of code adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Since `i` is 5 and `j` is 2, the expression `xx[i][j - 1]` translates to `xx[5][1]`.

Thus, the value of `nx` is updated to its current value plus `xx[5][1]`.

Since the initial value of `nx` is not specified, we can only express the new value of `nx` in terms of its previous value and the element `xx[5][1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `nx` is updated to its previous value plus `xx[5][1]`**.
