The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Given that `j` is 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` simplifies to `xx[i][0]`.

Since `xx[i][j - 1]` (or `xx[i][0]`) is not equal to '?', it implies that `xx[i][0]` holds a specific value (likely a number or another character).

Thus, `nx` will be updated to its current value plus the value of `xx[i][0]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][0]`.**
