The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the current value of `nx`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `n`), except for `nx` which is modified by having 'S' concatenated to it. The variable `j` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`nx` is the original `nx` with 'S' appended to it, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `n` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1.**
