Postcondition: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` has the character `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it. Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, `nx` has an additional 'F' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` plus 'S'.**
