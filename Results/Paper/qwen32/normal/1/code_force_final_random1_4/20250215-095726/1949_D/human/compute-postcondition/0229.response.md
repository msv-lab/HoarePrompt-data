Postcondition: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` includes the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i` is in `sb[:n // 4]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4]`, `nx` has 'S' appended to it; otherwise, `nx` has 'F' appended to it.**
