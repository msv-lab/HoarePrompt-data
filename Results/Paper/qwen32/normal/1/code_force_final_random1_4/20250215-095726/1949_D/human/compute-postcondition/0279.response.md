The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. However, the initial state does not specify the initial value of `nx`. Therefore, we can only determine that `nx` will have its original value with 'F' appended to it.

Given the initial state, the values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The variable `nx` is modified to include the additional character 'F'.

Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `nx` is the original value of `nx` with 'F' appended.**
