The code snippet `a[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the array `a` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `a[j]`.

Output State: **`x` is the new input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` after all iterations, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the character at position `j-1` in `x` is 'F'; `a[j]` is incremented by 1.**
