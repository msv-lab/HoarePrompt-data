The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing value of the string `nx`. Since the initial state specifies that `nx` is an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` will be equal to 'F'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`. Additionally, either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.**
