The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` was an empty string, so after appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'F'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is 'F', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Additionally, `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4]`.**
