The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given that the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1, it means that for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is a string from user input, `j` is 2**
