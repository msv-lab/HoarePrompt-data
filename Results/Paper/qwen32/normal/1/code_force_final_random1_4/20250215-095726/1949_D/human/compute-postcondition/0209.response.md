The code snippet `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`. Given that `i` is 3, the list `sb` will now include the value 3.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0` plus the index `3`. If `a[2] == 0` and `b[2] == 0`, then `sa` includes the index `2`. If `a[1]` is 0 and `b[1]` is 0, then `sa` includes the index `1`. Additionally, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` is 3.**

In simpler terms, the list `sb` now includes the index `3`, and all other conditions remain the same.
