Postcondition: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list, `sb` is an empty list, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is equal to 0.**
