n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where each line contains n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is 'F' if the transition video between scenarios i and j is funny, 'S' if it is scary, '?' if it is undecided, or '.' if i = j. It is guaranteed that the i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j, and that at most ⌊n/2⌋ transition videos are already decided.
