The given code snippet modifies the variable `nx` by appending the character at index `j - 1` from the string `xx[i]` to it. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions.
- `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions.
- `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings.
- `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
- `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is now `j + 1`.

The line `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `j - 1` of the string `xx[i]` to `nx`.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is updated to include the character `xx[i][j - 1]`.**
