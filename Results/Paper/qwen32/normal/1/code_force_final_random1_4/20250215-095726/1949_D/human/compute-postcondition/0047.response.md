The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the array `b` by 1. The other variables (`x`, `xx`, `a`, `j`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` except `b[i]` is now `b[i] + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
