Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and `nx` has been updated to include 'F'. Additionally, either `i` is in the list `sa[:n // 4]` or `j` is in the list `sa[:n // 4]`.**

This means that the value of `nx` now includes the character 'F' appended to its previous value. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
