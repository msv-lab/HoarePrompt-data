The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `j`.

Given that the loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the current state is at the end of the previous iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, let's call it `j_old`.
- Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_old + 1`.
- The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is the original `nx` plus `xx[n][n - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` is either `xx[i][j - 1] + 'F'` or `'FF'` or `'SF'` if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`; otherwise, `nx` is either `xx[i][j - 1] + 'S'` or `'FS'` or `'SS'` depending on the original value of `nx`. The variables `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `n` remain unchanged, `j` is `j_old + 1`**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `j_old`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is the original `nx` plus `xx[n][n - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` is either `xx[i][j - 1] + 'F'` or `'FF'` or `'SF'` if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`; otherwise, `nx` is either `xx[i][j - 1] + 'S'` or `'FS'` or `'SS'` depending on the original value of `nx`. The variables `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `n` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1**.
