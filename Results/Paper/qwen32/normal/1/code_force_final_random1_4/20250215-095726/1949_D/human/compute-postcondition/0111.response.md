Postcondition: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, at index `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to 0.**
