The given code snippet appends the character at position `j-1` of the string `xx[i]` to the string `nx`.

Given the initial state, `nx` is initially an empty string. After executing the line `nx += xx[i][j - 1]`, `nx` will contain the character from `xx[i]` at index `j-1`.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. Additionally, `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**.
