Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `i` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3

Code Snippet:
```python
nx += xx[i][j - 1]
```

The value of `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Here, `i` is 5, and `j` is 3, so `j - 1` is 2. This means the value at `xx[5][2]` is added to `nx`.

Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `nx` is increased by `xx[5][2]`.**

In natural language: The value of `nx` is now increased by the value located at `xx[5][2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
