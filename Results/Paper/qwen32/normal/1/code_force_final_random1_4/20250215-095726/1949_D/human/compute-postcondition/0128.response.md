The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing value of `nx`. Since the initial state specifies that `nx` is an empty string, after appending 'F', `nx` will be 'F'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is 'F', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Additionally, either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.**
