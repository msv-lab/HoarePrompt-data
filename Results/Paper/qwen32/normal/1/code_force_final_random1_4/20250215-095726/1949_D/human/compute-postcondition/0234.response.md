Postcondition: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 2`. If `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is the original `nx` with 'S' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` has an additional 'F' appended to its previous value.**
