The code snippet appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `nx`, we assume it is a string. After the operation, `nx` will have its original value plus 'S' appended to it. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `nx` is the original value of `nx` with 'S' appended**.
