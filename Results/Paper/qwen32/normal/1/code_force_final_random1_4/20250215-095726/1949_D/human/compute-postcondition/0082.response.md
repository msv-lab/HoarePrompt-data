The code increments the value at index `i` of array `b` by 1. Given that `i` is `n`, the value at index `n` of array `b` will increase by 1. The values of `x`, `xx`, `a`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the new input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` after all iterations except `b[n]` which is incremented by 1, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n`.**
