The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string stored in the variable `nx`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `nx`.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is the original `nx` string with 'S' appended to it.**
