The code snippet `b[j] += 1` increments the value of the element at index `j` in the array `b` by 1. 

Given the initial state, the only change is that the value of `b[j]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` except `b[j]` which is now `b[j] + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`.**
