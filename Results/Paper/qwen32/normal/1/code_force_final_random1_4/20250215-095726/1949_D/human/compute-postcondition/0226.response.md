The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the current value of `nx`, we assume `nx` is a string that may or may not contain some characters already. After appending 'S', the new value of `nx` will be the old value of `nx` with 'S' added to its end.

None of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`, `j`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is now `j + 1`. `nx` is the original `nx` with 'S' appended to it.**
