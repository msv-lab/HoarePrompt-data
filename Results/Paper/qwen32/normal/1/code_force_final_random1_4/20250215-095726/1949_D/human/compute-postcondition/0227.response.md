The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. This means that the length of `nx` increases by 1, and the last character of `nx` is now 'F'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is now `j + 1`. `nx` has an additional 'F' appended to it.**
