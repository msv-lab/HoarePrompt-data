To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic used to construct the string `nx`.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`xx`**: This is a 2D list (a list of lists). Specifically, `xx[4]` is one of the sublists within `xx`.
2. **`n`**: This is the length of the sublist `xx[4]`.
3. **`sb`**: This is another list, and `sb[:n // 4]` refers to the first `n // 4` elements of this list.
4. **`nx`**: This string is constructed by iterating over the characters in `xx[4]` and applying specific rules to determine whether to append the character directly or replace it with 'S' or 'F'.

### Construction of `nx`:

- We start with an empty string `nx`.
- We iterate over each character in `xx[4]` from index `0` to `n-1`.
- For each character `xx[4][j]`:
  - If `xx[4][j]` is not '?', we append it directly to `nx`.
  - If `xx[4][j]` is '?':
    - We check if the current index `j` (or `i`, which is always 4) is in the list `sb[:n // 4]`.
    - If either `j` or `i` is in `sb[:n // 4]`, we append 'S' to `nx`.
    - Otherwise, we append 'F' to `nx`.

### Given Information:

- `i` is always 4.
- The specific contents of `xx[4]` and `sb` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact characters that will be appended to `nx`.

### Output Description:

Based on the above logic, the string `nx` will be constructed by following the rules described. Since the exact contents of `xx[4]` and `sb` are not provided, we can only describe the construction process and not the exact string.

Output: **nx (where nx is constructed by appending characters from xx[4] according to the specified rules: if the character is not '?', append it directly; if it is '?', append 'S' if the index or i (which is 4) is in sb[:n // 4]; otherwise, append 'F')**
