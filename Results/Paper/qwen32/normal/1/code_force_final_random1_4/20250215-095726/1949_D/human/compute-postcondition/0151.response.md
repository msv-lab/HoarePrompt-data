The code appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, it will now hold the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is `xx[i][j - 1]`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**.
