To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
nx += xx[i][j - 1]
```

Given:
- `nx` is a string.
- `i` is 4.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (though `n` is not used in the code snippet).
- `j` is 5.

The line of code appends the character at index `j - 1` of the string located at index `i` in the list `xx` to the string `nx`. 

Since `j` is 5, `j - 1` is 4. Thus, the character at index 4 of the string at index `i` (which is 4) in the list `xx` will be appended to `nx`.

Let's denote the character at `xx[4][4]` as `char_xx_4_4`.

Therefore, `nx` will now be `nx + char_xx_4_4`.

Output State: **`nx` is a string concatenated with `xx[4][4]`, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 5.**
