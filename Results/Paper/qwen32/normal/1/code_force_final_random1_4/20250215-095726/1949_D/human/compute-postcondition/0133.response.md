The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value between 1 and `n`. For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, provided it is still within the bounds of the loop (i.e., `j < n + 1`).

Let's assume `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

Since the state description does not specify the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `j` should simply be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can simply say:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1**.

Thus, the final state can be written as:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`**.
