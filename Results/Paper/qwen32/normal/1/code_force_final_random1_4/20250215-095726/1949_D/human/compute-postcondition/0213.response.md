The given Python code snippet initializes a new variable `nx` with an empty string. This does not affect any of the existing variables `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, or `n`. 

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the addition of the new variable `nx`.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is an empty string.**
