### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by maintaining cumulative counts of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario and then deciding the types of the remaining '?' transitions based on these counts. However, the logic used to decide the types of the remaining transitions does not ensure that the condition of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is met for all possible permutations of scenarios.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Counting Transitions**: The code correctly counts the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario using arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Classifying Scenarios**: The code classifies scenarios into two lists, `sa` and `sb`, based on whether they have 'F' transitions but no 'S' transitions, or vice versa. This classification is used to decide how to fill the '?' transitions.

3. **Deciding '?' Transitions**: The core issue lies in how the '?' transitions are filled:
   - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, the code assigns 'F' to '?' transitions if either the row or column index is within the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) indices of `sa`; otherwise, it assigns 'S'.
   - If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, the code assigns 'S' to '?' transitions if either the row or column index is within the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) indices of `sb`; otherwise, it assigns 'F'.

   This approach does not guarantee that the resulting sequence of transitions will not have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for all possible permutations of scenarios. The decision to assign 'F' or 'S' based on the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) indices of `sa` or `sb` is arbitrary and does not consider the overall distribution of transitions required to meet the problem's constraints.

4. **Ensuring Constraints**: To ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type occur, a more sophisticated approach is needed. This might involve dynamically adjusting the assignments based on the current sequence of transitions being formed, ensuring that the constraint is met for all permutations.

Given these issues, the provided code does not guarantee that the output will satisfy the problem's constraints for all possible permutations of scenarios.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
