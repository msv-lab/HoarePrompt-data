The code appends the character `'F'` to the variable `nx`. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is 3. Since the code does not affect `n` or `j`, these conditions remain valid. The only change is to `nx`, which now includes the additional character `'F'`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `nx` is its original value plus 'F'**.
