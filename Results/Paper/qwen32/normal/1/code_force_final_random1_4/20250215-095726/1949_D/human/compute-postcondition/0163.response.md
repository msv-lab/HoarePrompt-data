Postcondition: **`nx` is either `xx[i][j - 1] + 'F'` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?' and `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or `'FF'` or `'SF'` depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`. If `i` or `j` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, `nx` is either `xx[i][j - 1] + 'S'` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', or 'FS' if `nx` was 'F', or 'SS' if `nx` was 'S'. The variables `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
