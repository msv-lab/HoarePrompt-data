The code snippet provided increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. This means that the element at index `j` in the array `a` will have its value increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` is updated such that `a[i]` is incremented by 1 (specifically `a[j]` is incremented by 1), `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`.**
