Output State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` except `a[j]` is incremented by 2, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The value of `a[j]` is incremented by 1, as specified in the code snippet. Therefore, if `a[j]` was previously some value, it is now that value plus 1. No other variables are affected by this line of code.
