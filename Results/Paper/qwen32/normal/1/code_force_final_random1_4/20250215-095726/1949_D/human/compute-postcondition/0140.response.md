The given code snippet modifies the variable `nx` by appending the character at index `j-1` of the string `xx[i]` to it. 

Given the initial state, `xx` is a list of strings with `n+1` elements, where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent elements are the `n` input strings. `i` is not explicitly mentioned to be changed, so we assume `i` remains the same. `j` is incremented by 1 before this line, so `j-1` refers to the current position in the string `xx[i]`.

Therefore, the value of `nx` will be updated to include the character at position `j-1` of the string `xx[i]`.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is updated to include `xx[i][j - 1]`.**
