Postcondition: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the sequence "aFbScSdSaFbScSdSaFbScSdS..." is repeated `n` times. Otherwise, a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, is created where each character is either directly from `xx[i][j-1]` or determined by the conditions involving `sb`.**
