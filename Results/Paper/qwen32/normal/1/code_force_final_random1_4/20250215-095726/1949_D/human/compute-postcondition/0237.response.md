To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, we need to understand the construction of the string `nx` based on the initial state provided. 

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `nx` is a string of length `n`.
- `nx` is constructed by appending characters from `xx[i]` or 'S'/'F' based on certain conditions.

However, the specific conditions under which characters from `xx[i]` or 'S'/'F' are appended to `nx` are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe `nx` in terms of its construction process.

### Construction Process:
- `nx` is built iteratively.
- For each position `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, a character is chosen either from `xx[i]` or from the set {'S', 'F'} based on some unspecified conditions.
- The exact characters and the conditions determining their selection are not provided.

Given this information, we cannot determine the exact sequence of characters in `nx`. However, we can describe it precisely in terms of how it is constructed.

### Output Description:
The `print(nx)` statement will output the string `nx`, which is constructed by appending characters from `xx[i]` or 'S'/'F' based on the given conditions.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n constructed by appending characters from xx[i] or 'S'/'F' based on the given conditions)**
