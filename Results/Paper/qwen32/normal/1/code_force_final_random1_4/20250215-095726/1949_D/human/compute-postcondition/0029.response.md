Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is a string from user input, `j` is 3. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a` is `[0, 1, 0]`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[3]` is 1, and the operation `b[i] += 1` cannot be performed due to the undefined list `b`. For any other character at `x[j - 1]`, no changes occur to `a` or `b`.**
