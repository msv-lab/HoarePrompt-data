The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. However, `nx` is not defined in the initial state, so we can infer that `nx` must have been initialized as an empty string or some other string before this line of code was executed. Since the problem does not specify the initial value of `nx`, we can only say that after this operation, `nx` will have 'S' appended to its current value.

Given the initial state, the values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `nx` is the original value of `nx` with 'S' appended**.
