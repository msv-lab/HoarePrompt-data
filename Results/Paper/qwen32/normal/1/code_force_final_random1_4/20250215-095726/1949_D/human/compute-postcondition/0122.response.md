The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `nx` with an empty string. None of the existing variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`) are modified.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is an empty string.**
