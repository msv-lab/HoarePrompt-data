To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition: `power` and `n`.

The loop condition is `while power < n:`. This means that for the loop to execute, `power` must be less than `n`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n_cases` is equal to `t`
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user
- `power` is 1

Let's analyze the variables involved in the loop condition:
- `power` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user.

For the loop to execute, `power` (which is 1) must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user, for `n` to be greater than 1, the integer provided by the user must be greater than 2 (because log₂(2) = 1).

Thus, the only adjustment needed is ensuring that the integer provided by the user is greater than 2, which will make `n` (the base-2 logarithm of that integer) greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of an integer greater than 2, `power` is 1**
