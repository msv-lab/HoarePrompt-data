The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is equal to `t`.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the integer provided by the user, and if `n` is not equal to 1, it is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user.
- `power` is determined based on the value of `n`.

Since the loop iterates over `range(n_cases)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n_cases`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration and gets incremented by 1).
- `n_cases` remains the same, which is `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 2, and `n` is the integer provided by the user. If `n` is equal to 1, no changes are made to `n`. Otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user, and `power` is equal to `n` if the original `power` was equal to `n`; otherwise, `power` is equal to `n - 1`.**
