The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, which was previously described in the initial state. The value of `n` for each test case remains unchanged and is still described as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, and for each of the `n_cases` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
