To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses based on the given conditions. The loop increments `power` until it reaches or exceeds `n`, which is defined as `log2(n_cases)`. 

From the provided information, we know:
- After the first iteration, `power` becomes 2.
- After the second iteration, `power` becomes 3.
- After the third iteration, `power` becomes 4.

This implies that `n` (which is `log2(n_cases)`) must be at least 4 for the loop to run three times. Therefore, `n_cases` (which is equal to `t`) must be at least \(2^4 = 16\).

The loop will continue to run until `power` is no longer less than `n`. Since `n` is `log2(n_cases)`, the loop will stop when `power` equals `log2(n_cases)`.

Thus, the final state of `power` will be `log2(n_cases)`, and since `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `power` will be `log2(t)`.

Let's summarize the final output state:
- `t` remains the same as the input value.
- `n_cases` remains equal to `t`.
- `i` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `n` remains `log2(n_cases)`.
- `power` will be equal to `n`, i.e., `log2(t)`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 0, `n` is `log2(n_cases)`, `power` is `log2(t)`**.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `power` will be equal to the base-2 logarithm of `t`, and all other variables will retain their initial values except for `power`.
