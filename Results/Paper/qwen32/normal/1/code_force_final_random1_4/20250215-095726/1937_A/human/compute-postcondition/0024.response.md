Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is equal to `t`.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is the integer provided by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the integer `1` to the console. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, or `n`. It simply prints the number `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
