To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```python
while power < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can infer that the loop will continue as long as `power` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n_cases` is equal to `t`
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `power` is 3

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < n` must be true. Currently, `power` is 3, so `n` must be greater than 3 to satisfy the condition.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `power` remains 3 (since it is part of the loop condition but we are not instructed to change it).
- `n` must be greater than 3 to ensure the loop can execute again.

No other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`) are part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the modified state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `power` is 3**
