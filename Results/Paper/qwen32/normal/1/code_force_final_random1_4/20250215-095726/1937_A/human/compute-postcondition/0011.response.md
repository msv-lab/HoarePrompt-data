Output State: **`power` is incremented by 1; `n` is dependent on `t` (`n = log2(t)`), ensuring `log2(t) > 2`; `t` must be greater than 4; `n_cases` is equal to `t`, so `n_cases` must also be greater than 4.**

Natural Language: The value of `power` is increased by 1. All other conditions remain the same: `n` is still dependent on `t` such that `n = log2(t)` and `log2(t) > 2`, meaning `t` must be greater than 4. Consequently, `n_cases` which is equal to `t` must also be greater than 4.
