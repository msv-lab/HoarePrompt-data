To determine the output of the `print(2 ** power)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and derive the necessary values step-by-step:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **Variable `n_cases`**: It is set to the value of `t`.
3. **Variable `i`**: It is explicitly set to 2.
4. **Variable `power`**: It is calculated as `ceil(log2(t)) - 1`.

Let's analyze the calculation of `power`:
- `log2(t)` computes the base-2 logarithm of `t`.
- `ceil(log2(t))` rounds up the result of `log2(t)` to the nearest integer.
- Subtracting 1 from `ceil(log2(t))` gives us the final value of `power`.

Given the range of `t` (from 1 to \(10^4\)), let's consider the possible values of `power`:
- For `t = 1`: `log2(1) = 0`, `ceil(0) = 0`, so `power = 0 - 1 = -1`.
- For `t = 2`: `log2(2) = 1`, `ceil(1) = 1`, so `power = 1 - 1 = 0`.
- For `t = 3` to `t = 3`: `log2(3) ≈ 1.58`, `ceil(1.58) = 2`, so `power = 2 - 1 = 1`.
- For `t = 4` to `t = 7`: `log2(4) = 2`, `ceil(2) = 2`, so `power = 2 - 1 = 1`.
- For `t = 8` to `t = 15`: `log2(8) = 3`, `ceil(3) = 3`, so `power = 3 - 1 = 2`.
- This pattern continues, with `power` increasing by 1 every time `t` doubles and reaches the next power of 2.

Given the range of `t` up to \(10^4\):
- The highest power of 2 within this range is \(2^{13} = 8192\), so for `t` up to 8192, `power` ranges from -1 to 12.
- For `t` from 8193 to \(10^4\), `log2(10000) ≈ 13.28`, `ceil(13.28) = 14`, so `power = 14 - 1 = 13`.

Since `power` is calculated based on the value of `t` and the specific value of `t` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `power`.

The `print(2 ** power)` statement will output \(2\) raised to the power of `power`.

Therefore, the output can be described as:
Output: **2 ** power (where power is ceil(log2(t)) - 1)**
