To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step:

1. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is set to the value of `t`.
   - `i` is set to 2.
   - `power` is calculated as `ceil(log2(t))`.
   - `power` is also explicitly stated to be equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding `power`:**
   - `power` is determined by the formula `ceil(log2(t))`, which means it is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `t`.
   - Given that `power` is also equal to `n`, we can infer that `n` is the same as `power`.

3. **The Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - This means we need to calculate \(2\) raised to the power of `power`.

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since `power` is `ceil(log2(t))`, \(2^{power}\) will be the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `t`.
   - For example, if `t` is 5, then `log2(5)` is approximately 2.32, so `ceil(log2(5))` is 3. Therefore, \(2^3 = 8\).

Given the above reasoning, the output of the print statement will be \(2\) raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is `ceil(log2(t))`.

Therefore, the final output can be described as:

Output: **\(2^{power}\) (where \(power\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of \(t\))**
