To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop condition:

```python
while power < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the problem statement, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that \(3 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is equal to `t`.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is `log2(n_cases)`.
- `power` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < n` must be true. Let's break down the necessary conditions:

1. **Current State Analysis:**
   - `power` is currently 2.
   - `n` is `log2(n_cases)`, where `n_cases` is `t`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `power` must be less than `n`.

Given that `power` starts at 2, `n` (which is `log2(t)`) must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `n` is dependent on `t` (`n = log2(t)`), we need to ensure that `log2(t) > 2`.
   - Solving the inequality `log2(t) > 2` gives us `t > 4`.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 4. Since `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `n_cases` must also be greater than 4.

No other variables in the loop condition (`power` and `n`) need to be directly adjusted because adjusting `t` (and consequently `n_cases` and `n`) will satisfy the condition `power < n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(5 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 0, `n` is `log2(n_cases)`, `power` is 2**
