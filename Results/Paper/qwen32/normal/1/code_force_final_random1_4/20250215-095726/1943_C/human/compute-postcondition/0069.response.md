To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and the code:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `u2vs`: An adjacency list representing the graph.
   - `d`: A list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices, calculated using BFS.
   - `a` and `b`: Both hold the return value of `func_1(d)`. Since they are both assigned the same value, we can consider them equivalent.
   - `previous`: A list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices.
   - `path_ba`: A list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]`, representing a path from vertex `b` to vertex `0`.
   - `ops`: A list of tuples derived from `path_ba` based on its length (odd or even).

2. **Deriving `ops`:**
   - If the length of `path_ba` is **odd**, `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, ci)`, where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` (`len(path_ba) // 2`) and `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is **even**, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of `2`, where `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

3. **Transformation in the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement uses `map` with a lambda function to transform each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` in `ops` into a string `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`.
   - This transformation adds `1` to the first element of each tuple and leaves the second element unchanged.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The transformed strings are printed, separated by newlines.

### Example Calculation

Let's assume an example to illustrate the process:

- Suppose `path_ba = [3, 2, 1, 0]` (even length).
- The middle indices would be `1` and `2`.
- `c1 = 1` (middle index - 1) and `c2 = 2` (middle index).
- The tuples in `ops` would be `(1, 1)` and `(2, 1)`.
- After the transformation, these tuples become `'2 1'` and `'3 1'`.

### Final Output

Given the above steps and assuming the specific example provided, the output would be:

Output: **2 1
3 1**

However, since the exact `path_ba` is not provided, the output will be described in a general form:

- If `path_ba` is odd, the output will be a series of lines where each line is `c+1 i` for `i` from `0` to `ci`.
- If `path_ba` is even, the output will be a series of lines where each line is `c1+1 i` and `c2+1 i` for every odd `i`.

Thus, the precise output format based on the initial state is:

Output: **transformed elements of `ops` where each element `(x[0], x[1])` is transformed to `x[0] + 1 x[1]` and printed on separate lines**
