The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them into separate variables `u` and `v`, and converts them to integers. This changes the values of `u` and `v` from their initial states (which were defined as the first and second input integers minus 1) to the actual input integers.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the sublist at index `v` contains the values `v`, `u`, and `u`; the sublist at index `u` contains the values `v`, `u`, and `v`; the sublists at other indices contain their original values; `u` is the first input integer; `v` is the second input integer.**
