Postcondition: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by the BFS; `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, ci)`, where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` (`len(path_ba) // 2`) and `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of `2`, where `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
