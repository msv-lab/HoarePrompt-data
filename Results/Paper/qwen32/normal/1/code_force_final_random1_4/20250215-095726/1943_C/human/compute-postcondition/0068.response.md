To determine the output of the `print(len(ops))` statement, let's break down the information given in the initial state:

1. **`u2vs`**: This is an adjacency list representing the graph. Each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`.

2. **`d`**: This is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by Breadth-First Search (BFS).

3. **`a`**: This holds the return value of `func_1(d)`. However, the function `func_1` and its return value are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `a`.

4. **`previous`**: This is a list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices.

5. **`b`**: This also holds the return value of `func_1(d)`. Since `func_1(d)` is called twice, `b` should have the same value as `a`.

6. **`path_ba`**: This is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]`. This implies that `path_ba` starts with `b` and ends with `0`, and includes all intermediate vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`.

7. **`ops`**: The construction of `ops` depends on the length of `path_ba`:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list of tuples `(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, ci)`, where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` (`len(path_ba) // 2`) and `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list of tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of `2`, where `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

Given this information, the length of `ops` depends on the length of `path_ba`:
- If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` will have `len(path_ba) // 2 + 1` elements.
- If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` will have `len(path_ba) // 2` elements.

However, since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact number of elements in `ops`. We can only describe it in terms of the length of `path_ba`.

Thus, the output will be described as follows:
Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is determined by the length of path_ba)**
