The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not represent any specific state that needs to be adjusted. The loop's continuation depends on the range specified by `n - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the sublist at index `v` contains the values `v`, `u`, and `u`; the sublist at index `u` contains the values `v`, `u`, and `v`; the sublists at other indices contain their original values.
- `u` is the first input integer minus 1.
- `v` is the second input integer minus 1.

The loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations is less than `n - 1`. Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state, we only need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time based on the range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same in terms of the variables `u2vs`, `u`, and `v`. The loop control variable `_` does not need to be adjusted explicitly since it is just an iteration counter.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the sublist at index `v` contains the values `v`, `u`, and `u`; the sublist at index `u` contains the values `v`, `u`, and `v`; the sublists at other indices contain their original values; `u` is the first input integer minus 1; `v` is the second input integer minus 1**.
