The given code appends the value `u` to the sublist at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. 

Initial State Recap:
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists.
- The sublist at index `v-1` contains `[v, u, u]`.
- The sublist at index `u-1` contains `[v, u-1, v]`.
- The sublist at index `u` contains `[v, u, u, v]`.
- Sublists at other indices retain their original values.
- `u` is the first input integer minus 1.
- `v` is the second input integer minus 1.

After executing `u2vs[v].append(u)`, the sublist at index `v` now includes an additional element `u`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the sublist at index `v-1` contains `[v, u, u]`, the sublist at index `u-1` contains `[v, u-1, v]`, the sublist at index `u` contains `[v, u, u, v]`, the sublist at index `v` contains `[v, u, u, u]`, and sublists at other indices contain their original values; `u` is the first input integer minus 1; `v` is the second input integer minus 1.**
