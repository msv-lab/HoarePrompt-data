The code appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Given the initial state, `path_ba` initially contains `[b, n, n]`. After appending `n`, `path_ba` will now contain `[b, n, n, n]`.

The values of `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, and `b` remain unchanged. The condition `if n equals -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement` does not affect the current operation since we are only appending `n` to `path_ba`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by the BFS; `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, n, n, n]`; `n` is `previous[n]`.**
