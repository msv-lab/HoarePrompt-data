In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of within the loop body. Since there are no conditions in the loop head to evaluate, no specific adjustments to the program state are required to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by the BFS; `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n`; `n` is `previous[b]`. If `n` is equal to `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
