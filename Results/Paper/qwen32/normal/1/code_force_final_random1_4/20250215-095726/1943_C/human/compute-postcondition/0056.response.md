The code snippet assigns the value of `c2 - 1` to `c1`. Given that `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` will be one less than half the length of `path_ba`.

Since the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` will be an integer, and `c1` will also be an integer.

Output State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by the BFS; `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]`; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
