The code appends the value of `u` to the sublist at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. Given the initial state, the sublist at index `v` originally contains the value `v`. After appending `u`, the sublist at index `v` now contains the values `v` and `u`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the sublist at index `v` contains the values `v` and `u`; the sublists at other indices contain their original values; `u` is an input integer minus 1; `v` is an input integer minus 1.**
