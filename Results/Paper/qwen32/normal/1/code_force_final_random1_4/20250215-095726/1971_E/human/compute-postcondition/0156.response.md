To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. This means we need to consider the variables `i` and `a`.

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `len(b) - 1`.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `i` should be initialized to 1.

2. **List `a`:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(a)`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len(a)` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Set `i` to 1.
- Ensure `a` has at least two elements.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `a` must have at least two elements, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0]`**
