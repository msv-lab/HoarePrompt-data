### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it correctly computes the required values for each query.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It reads the list `a` of length `k+1` (including the starting point `0`) and the list `b` of length `k+1` (including the starting time `0`).

2. **Calculating Differences:**
   - `ad` is a list that stores the distances between consecutive points in `a`.
   - `bd` is a list that stores the time intervals between consecutive points in `b`.

3. **Calculating Speeds:**
   - `v` is a list that stores the speeds between consecutive points, calculated as the ratio of the corresponding distances (`ad`) to the time intervals (`bd`).

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `d`, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position `s` in the list `a` where `d` would fit.
   - If `d` exactly matches one of the points in `a`, the corresponding time from `b` is printed.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the time taken to reach `d` by adding the time taken to reach the previous point (`b[s-1]`) and the additional time taken to travel from `a[s-1]` to `d` at the speed `v[s]`.

5. **Output:**
   - The results for each query are printed on the same line, separated by spaces.

### Verification:

- **Binary Search (`bisect_left`):** This is used to efficiently find the interval in which the query point `d` lies. This is crucial because it allows us to determine the segment of the journey during which `d` is located.
  
- **Speed Calculation:** The speed between two points is correctly computed as the distance divided by the time interval. This ensures that the time taken to travel any distance within a segment can be accurately calculated.

- **Time Calculation:** The total time to reach `d` is calculated by adding the time taken to reach the previous point and the additional time to travel the remaining distance within the current segment.

Given the above steps, the program correctly implements the logic to compute the required times for each query. The use of binary search ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implementing the solution as per the problem statement and handles the edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
