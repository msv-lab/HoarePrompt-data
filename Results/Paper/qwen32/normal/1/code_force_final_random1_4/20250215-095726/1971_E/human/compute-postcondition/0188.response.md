The only variable in the loop head is `l`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l` and `q`. If `l` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration), and `q` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `l` should be 2.

State: **`i` is 1, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the insertion point of the original `ql` in `a`. If `a[s]` was equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` remains equal to `ql` and `l` is 2. Otherwise, the state of these variables remains unchanged, `l` is 2**
