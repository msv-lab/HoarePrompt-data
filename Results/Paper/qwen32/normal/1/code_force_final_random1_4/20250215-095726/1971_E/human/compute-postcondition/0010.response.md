The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i-1]` to the list `ad`. Given the initial state, `ad` initially contains two elements `[0, a[1] - a[0]]`. After executing the code, `ad` will have one more element appended to it, which is `a[i] - a[i-1]`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed, the new element being appended is `a[i] - a[i-1]`, where `i` is now the next index.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k > 0`; `q` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `k+1` integers where `a_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, and `a_k` = `n`; `b` is a list of `k+1` integers where `b_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`; `ad` is a list containing elements `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[i] - a[i-1]]`; `bd` is a list containing a single element `0`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
