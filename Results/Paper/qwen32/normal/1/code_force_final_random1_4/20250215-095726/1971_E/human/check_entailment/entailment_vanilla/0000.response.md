Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It then reads the `k` points `a_i` and `k` times `b_i`.
   - It also reads `q` queries `d`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `a` and `b` lists with an extra `0` at the beginning.
   - It calculates the differences `ad` and `bd` between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It calculates the speeds `v` for each segment between consecutive points.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `d`, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where `d` lies.
   - If `d` exactly matches one of the known points `a_i`, it directly outputs the corresponding time `b_i`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the exact time to reach `d` based on the speed in the current segment and adds the time taken to reach the previous known point.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The initialization of `a` and `b` with an extra `0` at the beginning is correct because it aligns with the problem statement that the car starts at point `0` at minute `0`.
   - The calculation of `ad` and `bd` correctly computes the distances and times between consecutive points.
   - The calculation of speeds `v` correctly computes the speed for each segment.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - Using `bisect_left` to find the segment where `d` lies is efficient and correct.
   - Handling the case when `d` exactly matches a known point `a_i` is correct.
   - Calculating the exact time to reach `d` in the current segment is correct. It subtracts the distance already covered to the previous point, multiplies by the speed in the current segment, and adds the time taken to reach the previous point.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all aspects of the problem, including initialization, query processing, and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
