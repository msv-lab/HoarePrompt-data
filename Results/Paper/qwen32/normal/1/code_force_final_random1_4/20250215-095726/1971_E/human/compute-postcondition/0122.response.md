The value of `m` is set to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `q` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0] + [a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `l` is 2, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order.**
