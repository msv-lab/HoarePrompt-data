Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k > 0`; `q` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `k+1` integers where `a_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, and `a_k` = `n`; `b` is a list of `k+1` integers where `b_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`; `ad` is a list containing `k+1` elements `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1]]`; `bd` is a list containing `k+1` elements `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1]]`; `v` is a list containing `k+1` elements `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k]]`; `l` is 2; `m` is 0; `i` is 1; `ql` is the newly read integer input; `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` is confirmed to be equal to `ql`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.`**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change any of the variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Thus, all the variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
