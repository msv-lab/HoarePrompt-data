To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that the only variable we can adjust is `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4;
- `n` is an integer read from input such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9;
- `k` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k > 0`;
- `q` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5;
- `a` is a list of `k+1` integers where `a_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, and `a_k` = `n`;
- `b` is a list of `k+1` integers where `b_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`;
- `ad` is a list containing elements `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[i] - a[i-1]]`;
- `bd` is a list containing a single element `0`;
- `i` is `i + 1`

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented, so `i` is now `i + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be this value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k > 0`; `q` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `k+1` integers where `a_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, and `a_k` = `n`; `b` is a list of `k+1` integers where `b_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`; `ad` is a list containing elements `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[i] - a[i-1]]`; `bd` is a list containing a single element `0`; `i` is `i + 1`**
