To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of the line `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` on the existing variables.

Given:
- `i` is 1
- `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`
- `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`
- `q` must be greater than 0
- `m` is 0
- `ql` is an input integer

The line `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module, which returns the index where `ql` would be inserted into the list `a` to maintain sorted order. This does not change the values of `i`, `bd`, `v`, `q`, `m`, or `ql`. It only assigns a new value to `s`.

Since we don't have the actual list `a` or the value of `ql`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we know that `s` will be an integer representing the insertion point.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in `a`**.
