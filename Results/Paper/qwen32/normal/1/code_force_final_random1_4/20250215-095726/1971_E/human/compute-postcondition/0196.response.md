Output State: **`i` is 1, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is the integer value from user input minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the new insertion point of `ql` in `a` found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `l` is 2. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program remains in the same state as the precondition. Otherwise, the program remains in the same state as the precondition.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `ql` is now reduced by the value of `a[s - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
