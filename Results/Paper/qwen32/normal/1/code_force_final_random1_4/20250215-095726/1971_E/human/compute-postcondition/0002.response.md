The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. This means the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `q` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `k`, and `q` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `q` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `k` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k-1`, and `a_k` = `n`; `b` is a list of `k` integers where 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k-1`. There are `q` queries, each query `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ `n`. The sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
