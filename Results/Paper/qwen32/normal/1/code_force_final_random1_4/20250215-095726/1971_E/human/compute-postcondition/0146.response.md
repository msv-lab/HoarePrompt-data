The given code snippet appends a new element to the list `ad`. Specifically, it calculates the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` and adds this difference to the end of the list `ad`.

Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 3. Therefore, the new element appended to `ad` will be `a[3] - a[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `q` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`, `bd` is `[0]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `l` is `q-1`, `m` is the value calculated in the last iteration, `i` is 3, `ql` is the value read in the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where the last `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order`**.

In natural language: The list `ad` now includes an additional element, which is the difference between the third and second elements of list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
