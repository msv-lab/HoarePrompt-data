The code appends the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i-1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 2, `bd` will have its second element as `b[2] - b[1]`.

Since `b` is initialized as `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` with at least 2 elements, `b` has at least three elements (including the initial `0`). Let's denote the elements of `b` as `b = [0, b1, b2, ...]`. Initially, `bd` is `[b1 - b0]`, which simplifies to `[b1]` because `b0` is `0`.

After executing the code, `bd` will be `[b1, b2 - b1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` with at least 2 elements, `bd` contains two elements `[b[1], b[2] - b[1]]`**.
