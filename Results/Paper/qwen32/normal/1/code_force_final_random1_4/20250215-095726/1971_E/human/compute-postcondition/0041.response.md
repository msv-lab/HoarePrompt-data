To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4).
   - `n`: An integer such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.
   - `k`: An integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k > 0`.
   - `q`: An integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5.
   - `a`: A list of `k+1` integers where `a_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, and `a_k` = `n`.
   - `b`: A list of `k+1` integers where `b_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`.
   - `ad`: A list containing `k+1` elements `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1]]`.
   - `bd`: A list containing `k+1` elements `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1]]`.
   - `v`: A list containing `k+1` elements `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k]]`.
   - `l`: Initialized to 0.
   - `m`: Calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
   - `i`: Initialized to 1.
   - `ql`: `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `s`: The index in `a` where `ql` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` is confirmed to be equal to `ql`.

2. **Calculation of `m`:**
   - `s` is determined by finding the appropriate index in the list `a` where `ql` would fit while maintaining the sorted order.
   - `m` is computed using the formula: `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

Given this context, the value of `m` depends on the specific values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`. Since these values are derived from the input lists `a` and `b`, and the specific value of `ql`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `m` without knowing the inputs.

However, we can describe the value of `m` precisely based on the given information:

- `b[s - 1]` is the element in the list `b` just before the position `s`.
- `bd[s]` is the difference between `b[s]` and `b[s - 1]`.
- `ql` is a value derived from the input, and it is adjusted by subtracting `a[s - 1]`.
- `ad[s]` is the difference between `a[s]` and `a[s - 1]`.

Thus, `m` is computed as a linear combination of these values.

Output: **m (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
