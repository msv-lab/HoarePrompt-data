`ql` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables (`i`, `bd`, `v`, `q`, `m`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer**.
