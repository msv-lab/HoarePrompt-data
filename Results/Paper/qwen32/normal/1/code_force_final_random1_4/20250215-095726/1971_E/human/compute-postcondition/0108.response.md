To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations step-by-step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables from Input:**
   - `n`: First integer read from the input.
   - `k`: Second integer read from the input.
   
2. **Lists Initialization:**
   - `a`: List initialized with `[0]` followed by integers read from the input.
   - `b`: List initialized with `[0]` followed by integers read from the input.
   
3. **Derived Lists:**
   - `ad`: Differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with `[0]`.
     \[
     ad = [0] + [a[i] - a[i - 1] \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(1, \text{len}(a))]
     \]
   - `bd`: Differences between consecutive elements of `b`, starting with `[0]`.
     \[
     bd = [0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(1, \text{len}(b))]
     \]
   - `v`: Ratios of corresponding elements of `ad` and `bd`, starting with `[0]`.
     \[
     v = [0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(1, \text{len}(a))]
     \]

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `l`: Initialized to `0`.
   - `m`: Accumulated value initialized to `m` (not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it seems to be used in the calculation).
   - `i`: Initialized to `1`.
   - `ql`: New integer read from the input, minus `a[s - 1]`.
   - `s`: Index where `ql` fits in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order.

5. **Calculation of `m`:**
   - `m` is updated as:
     \[
     m = m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * \frac{ql}{ad[s]}
     \]

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(int(m), end=' ')
```

### Determining the Value of `m`:
- The value of `m` depends on the initial value of `m` (which is not provided), the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`.
- Since the initial value of `m` is not specified, we can only describe `m` in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement will be the integer value of `m` after the specified calculations.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
