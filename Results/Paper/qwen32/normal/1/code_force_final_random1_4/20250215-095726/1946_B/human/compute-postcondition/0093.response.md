To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `sm`. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n`, updating `sm` whenever `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than the current value of `sm` or when `sm` is still `-111`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**: Initially, `sm` is set to `-111`.
2. **Iteration Process**:
   - For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n`, the loop checks if `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than `sm` or if `sm` is `-111`.
   - If either condition is true, `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.
   - Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.

After all iterations, `sm` will hold the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` across all `i` from `0` to `n`.

**Final Output State**:
- `smin` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `sm` will be the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` and `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n`.**

In simpler terms, `smin` stays the same, and `sm` becomes the largest difference between corresponding elements of `suf` and `smin` after all iterations.
