Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than or equal to 1; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace; `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[0:i+1]) for i in range(n)]`; `i` is `n-1`; `smin` is `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
        smin.append(suf[i + 1])
    else:
        smin.append(smin[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace; `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[0:i+1]) for i in range(n)]`; `i` is `n-1`. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is updated to `[0, suf[n]]`. Otherwise, `smin` remains `[0, 0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace; `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[0:i+1]) for i in range(n)]`; `i` is n-1; `smin` includes an additional element which is either the sum of all elements in `l` if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, or `smin[n-1]` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace; `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[0:i+1]) for i in range(n)]`; `i` is `n`; `smin` includes an additional element which is the sum of all elements in `l` if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, otherwise, `smin` includes an additional element which is the same as the last element of the previous `smin`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
