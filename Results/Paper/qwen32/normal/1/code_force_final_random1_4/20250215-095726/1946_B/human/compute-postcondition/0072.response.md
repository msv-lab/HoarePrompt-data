Postcondition: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], l[0] + l[1] + l[2], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, min(suf[i + 1], smin[i])]`, `n` must be greater than 0. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is updated to include `suf[i + 1]`; otherwise, `smin` is updated to include `0`.**
