To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the transformation rules for the variable `sm`.

### Initial State:
- The list remains `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]`. This detail about the list does not directly affect the value of `sm`.
- The value of `sm` is determined by the following conditions:
  - If `sm` was initially negative, it becomes `sm + ((abs(sm) // (10))`.
  - Otherwise, it becomes `((2^k - 1) * sm + suf[n]) % (10)`.

### Analysis:
1. **If `sm` was initially negative:**
   - Let's denote the initial value of `sm` as `-x` where `x` is a positive integer.
   - According to the rule, `sm` becomes `-x + ((x // 10))`.
   - This means `sm` is adjusted by adding the integer division of its absolute value by 10.

2. **If `sm` was initially non-negative:**
   - Let's denote the initial value of `sm` as `y` where `y` is a non-negative integer.
   - According to the rule, `sm` becomes `((2^k - 1) * y + suf[n]) % 10`.
   - Here, `k` and `n` are not specified, so we cannot compute the exact value without these details. However, we know the result will be a single digit (0 through 9) due to the modulo operation with 10.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, we do not have specific values for `sm`, `k`, `n`, or `suf[n]`. Therefore, we can only describe the transformation rules and not the exact numerical value of `sm` after the transformation.

However, if we assume that the initial value of `sm` is provided or known, we can apply the transformation rules to find the final value of `sm`.

Since the exact initial value of `sm` is not provided, we can only describe the possible outcomes based on the given conditions.

### Final Output:
If `sm` was initially negative, it gets adjusted by adding the integer division of its absolute value by 10.
If `sm` was initially non-negative, it gets transformed according to the formula `((2^k - 1) * sm + suf[n]) % 10`.

Without the exact initial value of `sm`, we cannot provide a precise numerical output. However, we can describe the transformation:

Output: **sm (where sm is adjusted based on the initial value and the given transformation rules)**
