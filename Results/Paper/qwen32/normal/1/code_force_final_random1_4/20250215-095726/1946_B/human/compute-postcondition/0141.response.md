The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n + 1`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it would be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to continue, `k + 1` must be less than `n + 1`.

Thus, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`suf` and `smin` each contain `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0, `n` is at least 0, `i` is incremented by 1** (which means `i` is now `i + 1` from the previous state)
