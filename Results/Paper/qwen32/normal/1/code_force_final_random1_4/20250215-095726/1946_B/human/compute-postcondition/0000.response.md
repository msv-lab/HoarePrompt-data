Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, while all other conditions and variables remain unchanged as they were part of the problem's initial state and not directly affected by the provided code snippet.
