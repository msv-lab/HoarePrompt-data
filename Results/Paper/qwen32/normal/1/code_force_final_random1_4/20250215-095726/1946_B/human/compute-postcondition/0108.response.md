The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `suf`. This action does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`smin` remains `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`; `sm` is updated based on its original value; `j` is `j + 1`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `n` is `int(b[0])`; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the split input line to integers; `suf` is `[]`.**
