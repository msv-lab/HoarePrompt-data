The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increase `i` by 1 again to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it would be 4 at the start of the next iteration. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

State: **The list remains [0, 0, 0, ..., 0] (a list of `n+1` zeros), `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm` was initially -111, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 4**
