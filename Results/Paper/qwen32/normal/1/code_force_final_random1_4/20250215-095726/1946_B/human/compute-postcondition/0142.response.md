Output State: **`suf` and `smin` each contain `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0, `n` is at least 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `sm` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `sm` is calculated as the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]`. Since both `suf[i]` and `smin[i]` are initialized to 0, `sm` becomes 0. The values of `suf`, `smin`, `n`, and the incremented `i` remain unchanged except for the new value of `sm`.
