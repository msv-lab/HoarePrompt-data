The code snippet calculates the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]` and assigns this value to `sm`. The values of `smin`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `sm`.

Given the initial state:
- `smin` is defined as `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0
- `i` is `i + 1`

After executing the code:
- `sm` is assigned the value `suf[i] - smin[i]`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `sm` is `suf[i] - smin[i]`**.
