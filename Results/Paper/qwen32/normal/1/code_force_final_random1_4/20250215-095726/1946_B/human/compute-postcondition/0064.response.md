The code appends the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given the initial state, `n` must still be greater than `i + 2` after `i` is incremented by 2. The value of `i` itself is updated to `i + 2` before the append operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`; `i` is `i + 2`; `suf` has an additional element which is `suf[i] + l[i]` appended to it.**
