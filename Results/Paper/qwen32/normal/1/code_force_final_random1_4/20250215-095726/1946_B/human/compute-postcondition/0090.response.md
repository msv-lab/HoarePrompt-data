The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. Since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means `i` should now be `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration (but since `i` was already incremented, it should simply be `i + 1`).

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit for the loop.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same.

State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
