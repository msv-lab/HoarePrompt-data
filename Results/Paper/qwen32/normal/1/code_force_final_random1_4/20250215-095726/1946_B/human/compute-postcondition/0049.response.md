The given Python code snippet modifies the value of `sm` by taking its modulus with \(10^9 + 7\). This operation ensures that `sm` remains within a specific range, which is often used in programming contests to prevent integer overflow.

Given the initial state:
- The list consists entirely of zeros (this detail does not affect the value of `sm` directly).
- `sm` is calculated as `((2^k - 1) * sm) + suf[n]`.
- `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.

After executing the line `sm = sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, the new value of `sm` will be the remainder when the original `sm` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **The list consists entirely of zeros, `sm` is `((2^k - 1) * sm + suf[n]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.**
