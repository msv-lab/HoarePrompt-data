The code snippet increments the variable `sm` by adding the value of `suf[n]` to it. The variable `smin` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the provided code.

Given the initial state, `sm` was initially set to `2`. After executing the line `sm += suf[n]`, the new value of `sm` will be `2 + suf[n]`.

Output State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` and `sm` is `2 + suf[n]`**.
