The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i + 2`.

State: **`smin` is `[0, suf[i + 1]]` if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`; otherwise, `smin` is `[0, suf[i + 1], smin[i]]` if `smin` was initially `[0, smin[i]]`, or `[0, 0]` if `smin` was initially `[0]`. `sm` is updated based on its original value, `j` is `j + 1`, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `k` is `int(b[1])`, `l` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the split input line to integers, and `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`. `i` is `i + 2`.**
