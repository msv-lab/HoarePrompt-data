Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the new value of `sm` after executing the line `sm = suf[i] - smin[i]`.

- The list remains `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (a list of `n+1` zeros).
- `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm` was initially `-111`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `0`.
- `i` is `4`.

Since the list is a list of zeros, `suf[i]` and `smin[i]` would both be `0` when `i` is `4`. Thus, the calculation `suf[i] - smin[i]` results in `0 - 0`, which is `0`.

Therefore, `sm` is updated to `0`.

Output State: **The list remains [0, 0, 0, ..., 0] (a list of `n+1` zeros); `sm` is `0`; `n` is greater than or equal to `0`; `i` is `4`.**
