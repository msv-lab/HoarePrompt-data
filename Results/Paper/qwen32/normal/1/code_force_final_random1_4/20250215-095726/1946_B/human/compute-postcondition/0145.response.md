Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `[0, 0, ..., 0]`, `sm=0`

The code snippet is:
```python
sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm
```

Since `sm` is initially 0, we substitute `sm` into the equation:
```python
sm = 2 ** k * 0 - 0
```
This simplifies to:
```python
sm = 0
```

Therefore, the value of `sm` remains 0. The list of zeros `[0, 0, ..., 0]` is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **[0, 0, ..., 0], `sm` is 0**.
