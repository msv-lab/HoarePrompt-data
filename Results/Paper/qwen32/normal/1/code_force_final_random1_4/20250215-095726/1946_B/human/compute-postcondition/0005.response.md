The code reads a new line of input, splits it by whitespace, converts each split substring into an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `b`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b`; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace.**
