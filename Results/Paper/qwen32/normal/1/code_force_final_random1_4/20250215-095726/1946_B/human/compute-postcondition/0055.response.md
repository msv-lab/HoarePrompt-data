The code snippet assigns the integer value of the second element in the list `b` to the variable `k`. This means `k` now holds the integer value of `b[1]`.

Other variables (`sm`, `j`, `b`, `n`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **The list remains `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]`. If `sm` was initially negative, `sm` becomes `sm + ((abs(sm) // (10))`. Otherwise, `sm` becomes `((2^k - 1) * sm + suf[n]) % (10)`. `j` is `j + 1`. `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input. `n` is `int(b[0])`. `k` is `int(b[1])`.**
