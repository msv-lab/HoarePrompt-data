The code appends the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given the initial state, `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than `i + 1`. The value of `i` is already given as `i + 1`, indicating that `i` has been incremented before this line of code. 

Therefore, the new element added to `suf` is `suf[i] + l[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `suf` has a new element appended which is `suf[i] + l[i]`.**
