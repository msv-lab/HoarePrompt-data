Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than or equal to 1; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace; `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[0:i+1]) for i in range(n)]`; `i` is `n-1`**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop, the variable `suf` will contain a list where each element at index `j` (starting from 1) is the cumulative sum of the elements in list `l` up to index `j-1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the loop iteration. All other variables (`t`, `b`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
