Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace; `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[0:i+1]) for i in range(n)]`; `i` is n-1; `smin` includes an additional element which is either the sum of all elements in `l` if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, or `smin[n-1]` otherwise.**
