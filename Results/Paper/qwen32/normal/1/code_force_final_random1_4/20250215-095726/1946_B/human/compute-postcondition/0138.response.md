To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `suf` and `smin` each contain `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0.
- The variable `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm` was initially -111.
- The variable `n` is at least 0.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop definition, we know that `i` takes values from 0 to `n` inclusive. At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, to proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a value of `k` (where `0 <= k < n`). For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Since `n` does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`suf` and `smin` each contain `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0, `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm` was initially -111, `n` is at least 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`suf` and `smin` each contain `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0, `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm` was initially -111, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as:
State: **`suf` and `smin` each contain `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0, `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm` was initially -111, `n` is at least 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to match the format given in the examples:
State: **`suf` and `smin` each contain `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0, `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm` was initially -111, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.

But since we need to specify the exact state change:
If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`suf` and `smin` each contain `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0, `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm` was initially -111, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, the most accurate general form is:
State: **`suf` and `smin` each contain `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0, `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm` was initially -111, `n` is at least 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.

For the sake of matching the format:
State: **`suf` and `smin` each contain `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0, `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm` was initially -111, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.

But to be precise with the iteration:
State: **`suf` and `smin` each contain `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0, `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm` was initially -111, `n` is at least 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Final Answer:
State: **`suf` and `smin` each contain `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0, `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm` was initially -111, `n` is at least 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.
