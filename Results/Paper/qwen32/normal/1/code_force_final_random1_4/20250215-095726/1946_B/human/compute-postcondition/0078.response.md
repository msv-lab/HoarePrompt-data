The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given the initial state, `smin` already contains values calculated as the minimum between `suf[i + 1]` and the previous element in `smin`. After appending `suf[i + 1]`, the last element of `smin` will now be `suf[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], l[0] + l[1] + l[2], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, min(suf[i + 1], smin[i]), ..., min(suf[i + 1], smin[i]), suf[i + 1]]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.

In natural language: The list `smin` now includes an additional element at the end, which is `suf[i + 1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
