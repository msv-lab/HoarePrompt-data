Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If both `a` and `b` are even, then no changes are made to `a` or `b`. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. If `a - b == -a`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `b - a == -b`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `2a` is not equal to `b` and `2b` is not equal to `a`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the difference between `a` and `b` is zero.**
