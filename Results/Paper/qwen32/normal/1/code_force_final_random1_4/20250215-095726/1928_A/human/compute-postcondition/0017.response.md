Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'yes'`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables. The string `'yes'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

### Final Output:
Output: **yes**
