Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are both set to `a // 2`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, and if `b` is even, then `b1` and `b2` are both set to `b // 2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the program continues as specified in the if part. Otherwise, there is no change to `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`. If either `a` or `b` is not even, there is no further change to `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` beyond what is specified above.**
