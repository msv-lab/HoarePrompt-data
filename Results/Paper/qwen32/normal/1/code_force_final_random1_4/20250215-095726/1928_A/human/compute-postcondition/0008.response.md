Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. At least one of `a` or `b` is odd. Additionally, `2a` is not equal to `b` and `2b` is not equal to `a`. The difference between `a` and `b` is not zero, meaning `(a - b) % 2` is either greater than 0 or less than 0.**
