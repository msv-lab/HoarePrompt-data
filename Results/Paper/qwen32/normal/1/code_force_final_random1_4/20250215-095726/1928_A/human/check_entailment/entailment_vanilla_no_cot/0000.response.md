Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem states that Bob can form another rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle that is not a 90-degree rotation of the original one. 

### Key Observations:
1. If both dimensions `a` and `b` are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
2. If one dimension is odd and the other is even, Bob can also form a new rectangle.
3. If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because the smaller rectangles resulting from a cut will have at least one dimension that is 1, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is not a 90-degree rotation of the original.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The code checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If true, it prints 'yes'.
- It then checks conditions related to `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)`, which are incorrect and do not make sense in the context of the problem.
- It then checks if `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`. This condition is always true for non-zero differences, but it doesn't correctly handle the logic of forming a new rectangle.
- Finally, it defaults to printing 'no'.

### Correct Logic:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, the answer should be 'yes'.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the answer should be 'no'.

### Revised Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
