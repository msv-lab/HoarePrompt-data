Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variable `t`:** An integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
2. **Variables `a` and `b`:** Integers read from the input.
3. **Variables `a1` and `a2`:** Each assigned the value of `a // 2` if `a` is even.
4. **Variables `b1` and `b2`:** Remain unchanged unless `b` is even, in which case they are each assigned the value of `b // 2`.
5. **Condition:** If `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, there are no changes to `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, or `b1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, and `b1` do not influence the output of this particular `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'No'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, or `b1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
