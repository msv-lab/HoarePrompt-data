The `print` statement in the given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('no')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'no'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Based on the provided initial state and the code snippet, the output will simply be the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
