The given initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`, but none of these variables are used in the provided `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`:** It is described as an integer between 1 and \(10^4\). However, it is not used in the `print` statement.
2. **Variables `a` and `b`:** These are integers read from the input. Again, they are not used in the `print` statement.
3. **Variable `i`:** This variable is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. It also does not appear in the `print` statement.

Given that the `print` statement is `print('yes')`, it will output the string `'yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **yes**
