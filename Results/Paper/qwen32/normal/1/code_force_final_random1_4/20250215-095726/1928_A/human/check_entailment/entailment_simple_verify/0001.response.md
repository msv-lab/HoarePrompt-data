### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program using the provided annotations and the problem description to ensure accuracy.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
Bob can form a new rectangle from the two smaller rectangles he gets after cutting the original rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle is even. This is because:
- If both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd, cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller rectangles with at least one dimension being 1, which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle different from the original.
- If either `a` or `b` is even, we can always cut the rectangle in such a way that we get two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

#### Program Analysis Using Annotations:
Let's break down the provided code and annotations to understand its behavior:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

##### Annotations:
- **State before function call**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- **Inside the loop**:
  - `a, b` are read from input.
  - The conditions are evaluated to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.

##### Issues Identified:
1. **Condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`**:
   - This condition is syntactically incorrect and does not make logical sense. It seems like an attempt to check if `a` and `b` are equal, but the tuple construction `(a - b == -a, a)` is not a valid way to do that.
   
2. **Condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`**:
   - This condition checks if `a` and `b` are not equal, but it does not correctly determine if a new rectangle can be formed. It should instead check if at least one of `a` or `b` is even.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program should simply check if either `a` or `b` is even and print 'yes' if true, otherwise print 'no'.

#### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the provided code, the program is incorrect. The original assessment correctly identified these issues and concluded that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
