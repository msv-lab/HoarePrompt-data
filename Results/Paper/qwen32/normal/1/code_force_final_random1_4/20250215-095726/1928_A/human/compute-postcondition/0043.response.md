Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `a1` and `a2` are each `a // 2` if `a` is even; `b1` and `b2` remain unchanged. If `a` is even and `a1` is not equal to `b`, the program continues as specified in the if part. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.**
