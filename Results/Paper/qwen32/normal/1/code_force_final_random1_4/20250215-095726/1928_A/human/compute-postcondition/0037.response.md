The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. Therefore, the state of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` needs to be considered based on the conditions given.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\). Since the loop iterates `t` times, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining iterations.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs `t` times. After each iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.
2. The values of `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged unless the specific conditions inside the loop body are met. However, since the loop body is omitted, we assume these values are not modified by the loop itself.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are both set to `a // 2`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, and if `b` is even, then `b1` and `b2` are both set to `b // 2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the program continues as specified in the if part. Otherwise, there is no change to `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`. If either `a` or `b` is not even, there is no further change to `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` beyond what is specified above.**
