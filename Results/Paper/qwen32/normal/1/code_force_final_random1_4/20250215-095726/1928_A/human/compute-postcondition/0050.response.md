In this task, the initial state provides us with several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) but the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Let's break it down:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged.

However, none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **No**
