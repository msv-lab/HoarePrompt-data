The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is used as the loop counter. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

Given that the loop iterates `int(input())` times, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be set to its value at the start of the current iteration plus one.

Let's denote the number of iterations as `t` (which is `int(input())`). If `i` was `x` at the start of the current iteration, then at the end of this iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the start of the current iteration, we can denote it as `i_start`. After the loop body executes, `i` becomes `i_start + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_start + 1`.

However, since we are asked to describe the state at the start of the next iteration, and knowing that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we can simply state that `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

So, if `i` is `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If both `a` and `b` are even, then no changes are made to `a` or `b`. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. If `a - b == -a`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `b - a == -b`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `2a` is not equal to `b` and `2b` is not equal to `a`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the difference between `a` and `b` is zero; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

To simplify, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If both `a` and `b` are even, then no changes are made to `a` or `b`. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. If `a - b == -a`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `b - a == -b`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `2a` is not equal to `b` and `2b` is not equal to `a`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the difference between `a` and `b` is zero; `i` is `x + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `x`, we can just say `i` is incremented by 1:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If both `a` and `b` are even, then no changes are made to `a` or `b`. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. If `a - b == -a`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `b - a == -b`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `2a` is not equal to `b` and `2b` is not equal to `a`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the difference between `a` and `b` is zero; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
