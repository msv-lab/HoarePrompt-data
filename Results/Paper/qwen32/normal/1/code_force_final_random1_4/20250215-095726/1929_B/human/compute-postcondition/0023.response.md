To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed by the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
- `s` is the next line from the input file after the current `s`. This implies that `s` is a string read from an input source.
- `n` is the first integer from the split string of the new `s`. This means `s` is split into parts, and `n` is the integer value of the first part.
- `k` is the second integer from the split string of the new `s`. This means `s` is split into parts, and `k` is the integer value of the second part.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(k / 2))
```

### Explanation:
- The `math.ceil()` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number.
- The expression `k / 2` computes the division of `k` by 2.
- `math.ceil(k / 2)` then rounds up the result of this division to the nearest integer.

### Output Description:
Given the above steps, the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to half of `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is the second integer from the split string of the new s)**
