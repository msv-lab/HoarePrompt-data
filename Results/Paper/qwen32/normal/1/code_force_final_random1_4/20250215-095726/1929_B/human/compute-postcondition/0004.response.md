To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the formula used in the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). However, `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- The current value of `k` is defined as \( k = 4 \times n - 2 \).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `k`:**
   - According to the initial state, `k` is defined as \( k = 4 \times n - 2 \).
   
2. **Calculate the expression inside the `print` statement:**
   - The expression to evaluate is \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - Substitute \( k \) with \( 4 \times n - 2 \):
     \[
     k // 2 + 1 = (4 \times n - 2) // 2 + 1
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     (4 \times n - 2) // 2 + 1 = (4 \times n // 2 - 2 // 2) + 1 = (2 \times n - 1) + 1 = 2 \times n
     \]

### Final Calculation:
- Therefore, the expression simplifies to \( 2 \times n \).

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of \( 2 \times n \).

Output: **2 * n (where n is the integer read from the input)**
