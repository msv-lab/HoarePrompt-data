To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `_` is assigned the value 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Here, the expression `k // 2 + 1` involves the integer division of `k` by 2 and then adding 1 to the result. The value of `k` is not explicitly provided, but we know it is an integer read from the input.

Let's denote the value of `k` as `k_value`. The expression `k // 2 + 1` will evaluate to `(k_value // 2) + 1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **(k // 2) + 1 (where k is the integer read from the input)**
