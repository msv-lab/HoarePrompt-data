To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the components involved:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t`: An input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. This variable does not affect the `print` statement directly.
   - `n` and `k`: Integers read from the input. These are the primary variables involved in the calculation.
   - `_`: The value 2. This variable is not used in the `print` statement.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `ceil(k / 2)`.
   - `ceil(x)`: This function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`.

3. **Calculation Steps:**
   - The value of `k / 2` is calculated first. Since `k` is an integer, `k / 2` will result in either an integer (if `k` is even) or a float (if `k` is odd).
   - The `ceil` function then rounds this result up to the nearest integer.

4. **Possible Outcomes:**
   - If `k` is even, `k / 2` is already an integer, so `ceil(k / 2)` will be the same as `k / 2`.
   - If `k` is odd, `k / 2` will be a float with a fractional part of 0.5. The `ceil` function will round this up to the next whole number, which is `(k // 2) + 1`.

Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement will depend on the value of `k` but can be precisely described in terms of `k`.

**Output Description:**
- If `k` is even, the output will be `k / 2`.
- If `k` is odd, the output will be `(k // 2) + 1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
