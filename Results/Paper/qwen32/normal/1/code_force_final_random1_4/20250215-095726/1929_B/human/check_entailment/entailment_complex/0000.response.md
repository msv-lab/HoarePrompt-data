### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total in an \( n \times n \) grid.

Let's analyze the provided solution:

1. **Case 1: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**

   In this case, all diagonals must have at least one colored cell. The optimal strategy is to color one cell per diagonal. However, some diagonals intersect at the center, so we need to color slightly more than half of the diagonals to ensure all diagonals are covered. The formula used here is \( k // 2 + 1 \). This formula ensures that we cover all diagonals by coloring just enough cells.

2. **Case 2: \( k < 4n - 2 \)**

   Here, we need to color cells such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The optimal strategy is to color cells in such a way that we maximize the number of diagonals covered per cell. The formula used here is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). This formula ensures that we color the minimum number of cells while covering at least \( k \) diagonals.

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)**

  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( k < 4n - 2 \), we use \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 2: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)**

  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( k < 4n - 2 \), we use \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 3: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)**

  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( k = 4n - 2 \), we use \( 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \).
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 4: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)**

  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( k < 4n - 2 \), we use \( \lceil 9 / 2 \rceil = 5 \).
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 5: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)**

  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 4 - 2 = 14 \)
  - Since \( k < 4n - 2 \), we use \( \lceil 7 / 2 \rceil = 4 \).
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 6: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)**

  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 7 - 2 = 26 \)
  - Since \( k < 4n - 2 \), we use \( \lceil 11 / 2 \rceil = 6 \).
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 7: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)**

  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 2 - 2 = 6 \)
  - Since \( k < 4n - 2 \), we use \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
  - This matches the expected output.

All test cases match the expected outputs, confirming that the logic is correct.
