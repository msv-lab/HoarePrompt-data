You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the optimal arrangement of the array elements is to sort them in either ascending or descending order. However, the current implementation only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array, which is not the correct approach.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

**Example:**
```
Input:
2
3
1 3 2
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
3
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
3
```

While the program happens to produce the correct output for these specific examples, it does not always do so. Let's consider another example:

**Counterexample:**
```
Input:
2
4
1 6 2 5
3
10 20 30
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10
40
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
5
20
```

In the first counterexample, the optimal arrangement would be [1, 2, 5, 6], resulting in a beauty of (2-1) + (5-2) + (6-5) = 10. The program incorrectly outputs 5, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements (6-1).

In the second counterexample, the optimal arrangement would be [10, 20, 30], resulting in a beauty of (20-10) + (30-20) = 20. The program incorrectly outputs 20, but this is coincidental and does not guarantee correctness for all cases.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the beauty by sorting the array and then summing up the differences between consecutive elements. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += a[i] - a[i - 1]
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which maximizes the beauty.
