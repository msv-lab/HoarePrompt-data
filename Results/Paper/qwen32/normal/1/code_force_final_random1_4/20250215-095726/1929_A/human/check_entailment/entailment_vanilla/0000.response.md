Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step:

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. Specifically, we want to maximize the expression:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

### Key Insight
To maximize this sum, we should arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order. When the array is sorted, the largest possible difference \(a_n - a_1\) will contribute most significantly to the sum because it is the sum of all individual differences between consecutive elements.

### Simplification
However, the provided solution simplifies this by only considering the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_{\text{max}} - a_{\text{min}} \]
This is not entirely correct because the beauty is actually the sum of all consecutive differences, not just the difference between the max and min.

### Correct Calculation
The correct approach to calculate the beauty is to sort the array and then compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

### Example Verification
Let's verify with the first example:
- Input: `3 2 1 3`
- Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Beauty: `(2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2`

The provided solution would output `3-1=2`, which is correct for this specific case but does not generalize correctly.

### Conclusion
The provided solution is incorrect because it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, rather than the sum of all consecutive differences in the sorted array.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
