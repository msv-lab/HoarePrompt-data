To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. This represents the number of test cases.
- `n` is the newly input integer. This is the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the latest input. This means the elements of `a` are in ascending order.
- `ntest` must be greater than `itest`. This indicates that there is some loop or iteration control mechanism where `ntest` is the total number of tests and `itest` is the current test index.
- `itest` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. This suggests that `itest` keeps track of the current test case being processed.

### Code Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers:
- `a[0]` is the smallest element in the list `a`.
- `a[len(a) - 1]` is the largest element in the list `a`.

Therefore, `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` computes the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

### Output Description:
The code will print the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

Since the specific values of the list `a` are not provided, we cannot give a numerical output. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`**
