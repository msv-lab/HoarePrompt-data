### Reasoning:

The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To achieve the maximum beauty, we want to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements. 

The annotated program sorts the array and then computes the difference between the last (maximum) and the first (minimum) element of the sorted array. This approach works because the maximum beauty is obtained when the sequence is arranged in increasing order, making all differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) positive and contributing to the total beauty.

Let's verify this with the example provided:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Beauty: `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`
   - Output: `2`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0`
   - Output: `0`

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Beauty: `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57`
   - Output: `57`

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Beauty: `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1`
   - Output: `1`

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
   - Beauty: `(2-1) = 1`
   - Output: `1`

All these examples match the expected outputs, confirming that the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and computing the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

Correctness: **True**
