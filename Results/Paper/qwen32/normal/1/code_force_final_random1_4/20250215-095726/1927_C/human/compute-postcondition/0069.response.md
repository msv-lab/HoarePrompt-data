Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `i` is 1 and is present in both lists `a` and `b`; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and contains `i`; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input and contains `i`; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now 1 and `bOnes` remains 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` remains 0 and `bOnes` is now 1.**
