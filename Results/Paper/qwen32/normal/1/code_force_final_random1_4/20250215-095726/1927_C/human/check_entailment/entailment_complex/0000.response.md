### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining whether it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) such that all integers from 1 to \(k\) are included among the chosen elements. The provided solution iterates through each integer from 1 to \(k\) and tries to distribute these integers between the two arrays while maintaining the count of chosen elements from each array.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `aOnes` and `bOnes` are initialized to 0. These variables keep track of how many elements have been chosen from arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - `newk` is set to \(\frac{k}{2}\).

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop runs from 1 to \(k\).
   - For each integer `i` in this range, the code checks if `i` exists in both arrays `a` and `b`.
     - If `i` exists in both arrays, it increments either `aOnes` or `bOnes` based on which one is smaller.
   - If `i` exists only in array `a` and `aOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `aOnes`.
   - If `i` exists only in array `b` and `bOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `bOnes`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the loop breaks early, indicating that it is not possible to form the required selection.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, it means that it is possible to choose \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to \(k\) are included. The function prints "yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "no".

### Issues with the Provided Solution:

- **Checking Existence**: The current implementation uses `if i in a` and `if i in b` to check if an integer `i` exists in the arrays. This operation has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and \(O(m)\) for arrays `a` and `b`, respectively. Given the constraints, this approach would result in a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error because the total number of elements across all test cases can be up to \(4 \times 10^5\).

- **Efficiency**: To improve efficiency, we can use sets to store the elements of arrays `a` and `b`. Checking membership in a set is \(O(1)\) on average, making the solution feasible within the given constraints.

### Corrected Implementation:

```python
def func():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = set(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = set(map(int, input().split()))
        
        aOnes = 0
        
        bOnes = 0
        
        newk = k // 2
        
        i = 1
        
        while i <= k:
            if i in a and i in b:
                if aOnes < bOnes:
                    aOnes += 1
                else:
                    bOnes += 1
            elif i in a and aOnes < newk:
                aOnes += 1
            elif i in b and bOnes < newk:
                bOnes += 1
            else:
                break
            i += 1
        
        if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original solution is incorrect due to inefficiency. However, the logic itself is correct if implemented efficiently using sets. Since the provided solution does not use sets, it is not correct under the given constraints.

**Correctness: False**
