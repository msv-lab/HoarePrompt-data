Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i=3`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `t=2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
