The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `i` is 3, after executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 3; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 4; If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, and `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, and `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If none of these conditions are met, no change is made to `aOnes` or `bOnes`.**
