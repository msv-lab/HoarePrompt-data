Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `i=3`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `t=2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
