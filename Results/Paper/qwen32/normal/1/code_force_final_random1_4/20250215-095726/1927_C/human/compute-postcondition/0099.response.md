Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `i` is `k - 1`; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged except that `t` is incremented by 1. The variable `newk` is calculated as `k // 2`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
