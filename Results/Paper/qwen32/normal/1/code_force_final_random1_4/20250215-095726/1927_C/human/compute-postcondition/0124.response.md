Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i=1`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `t=2`. If the number of ones in `a` (`aOnes`) is less than the number of ones in `b` (`bOnes`), then `aOnes` is the number of ones in `a` plus one. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0. In both cases, `bOnes` is the number of ones in `b`. Additionally, `i` is present in both `a` and `b`.**
