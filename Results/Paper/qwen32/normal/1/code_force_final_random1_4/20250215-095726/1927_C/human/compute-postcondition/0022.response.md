Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1; `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`; either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
