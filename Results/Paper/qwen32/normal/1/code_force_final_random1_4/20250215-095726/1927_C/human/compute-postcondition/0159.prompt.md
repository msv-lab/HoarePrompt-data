Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i=1, a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2, t=2, aOnes=0, bOnes=0`.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i=2`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `t=2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `bOnes` is the number of ones in `b`. If the number of ones in `a` (`aOnes`) is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `aOnes` remains 0. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`; otherwise, `aOnes` remains 0. Similarly, `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`; otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i=3`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `t=2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, and `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If none of these conditions are met, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `i=4`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `t=2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
