Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m`, an even integer `k`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a list `b` of `m` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
