The code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `b`. The initial state mentions that `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` are already defined. After executing the given code, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
