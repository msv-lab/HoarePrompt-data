### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not accurately solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues in detail:

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code includes multiple utility functions for reading input and handling data, but the core logic for solving the problem is contained within `func_15` and `func_16`.

- **`func_15`**: This function is supposed to compute the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\). However, it only uses \(n\) and does not incorporate \(m\) or the condition involving \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  
  ```python
  def func_15():
      (n, m) = func_7()
      i = 1
      ans = 0
      while i * i <= n + i:
          ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
          i += 1
      return ans - 1
  ```

  This function appears to be counting something related to divisors of \(n + i\), but it does not check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

- **`func_16`**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, printing the results.

  ```python
  def func_16():
      for _ in range(func_10()):
          sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
  ```

  Since `func_15` is incorrect, `func_16` will also produce incorrect results.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. A more efficient approach would involve leveraging properties of divisors and gcd, but the current implementation does not do this.

#### Conclusion:
Given that `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to check the condition involving \(b\) and \(\gcd(a, b)\), the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
