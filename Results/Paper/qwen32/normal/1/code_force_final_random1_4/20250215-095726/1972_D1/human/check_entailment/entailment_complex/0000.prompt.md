Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` calculates and updates the rank of a given node `da` in a graph represented by a dictionary `d`. It recursively explores the neighbors of `da` (stored in `d[da]`), ensuring no cycles are revisited using the `processing` list. If `da` has only one neighbor, it returns 1. Otherwise, it computes the minimum rank among its neighbors and assigns `tmp + 1` to `rank[da - 1]`, where `tmp` is the smallest value returned by recursive calls.

    #The program returns a tuple where the first element is `y`, the second element is `x - a // b * y`, and the third element is `g`, which is the gcd of `b` and `a % b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and also returns the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = GCD(a, b)`. It returns a tuple `(x, y, GCD(a, b))`.

#Function 14:

    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: a is a list of integers, n is a positive integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and k is updated to its new value after all iterations. Additionally, k is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, and three additional integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It iterates over the first `n` elements of the list `a`. For each element less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After processing these elements, it returns 1 if `k` is non-negative, otherwise, it returns -1.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.

        i += 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers returned by `func_7()`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i` for the last valid `i`, `ans` is the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i - 1`.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i - 1`, `n` and `m` are positive integers returned by `func_7()`, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i` for the last valid `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` calculates a value based on the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i - 1`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from another function `func_7()`. Here, `i` is determined by the condition `i * i <= n + i`. The function returns this calculated sum minus one.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have parameters in its signature, so there are no variables to describe. However, based on the context, it seems to rely on other functions (`func_10` and `func_15`) which likely handle the input values `n` and `m`. Therefore, indirectly, we can infer that `func_10` returns the number of test cases `t`, and `func_15` computes the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each test case given `n` and `m`.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The output consists of `t` lines, each line containing the result of `func_15()` for each test case, separated by newline characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves computing the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on some criteria (indirectly provided by `func_15`). It outputs the result for each test case, with the number of test cases determined by another function (`func_10`).
