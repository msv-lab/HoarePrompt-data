In the given task, the for loop relies on the return value of `func_10()`. The loop will execute as many times as the value returned by `func_10()`. Since `func_10()` is supposed to return the number of test cases `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is set appropriately for the loop to execute.

Given that the loop head only involves the underscore `_` and the result of `func_10()`, we only need to adjust the state related to `func_10()`'s return value.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer.
2. The underscore `_` is just a placeholder for the loop variable and doesn't need to be adjusted since it's not used in the loop body (which is omitted).

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
