The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, and three additional integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It iterates over the first `n` elements of the list `a`. For each element less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After processing these elements, it returns 1 if `k` is non-negative, otherwise, it returns -1.
