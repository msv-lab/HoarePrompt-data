Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: This function does not have parameters in its signature, so there are no variables to describe. However, based on the context, it seems to rely on other functions (`func_10` and `func_15`) which likely handle the input values `n` and `m`. Therefore, indirectly, we can infer that `func_10` returns the number of test cases `t`, and `func_15` computes the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each test case given `n` and `m`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(func_10()):
    sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0; the value returned by `func_15()` is written to the standard output followed by a newline character.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character is written to the standard output; `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character is written to the standard output; `func_10()` must return a value greater than 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
