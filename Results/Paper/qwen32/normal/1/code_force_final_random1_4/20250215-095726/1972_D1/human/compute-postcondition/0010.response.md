The code snippet `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` to its current value. Given that `n` must be at least 6 and `i` is 3, we can compute the new value of `ans`.

First, let's calculate the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)`:
- `i` is 3, so `i * i` is `9`.
- `n` is at least 6, so `n + i` is at least `9`.
- Therefore, `(n + i) // 9` will be at least `1` when `n` is exactly `6`. For any `n` greater than `6`, the value of `(n + i) // 9` will be greater than `1`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified beyond it being at least `6`, we'll represent the new value of `ans` in terms of the original `ans` and the computed expression.

If `n` is `6`, then `ans` becomes `ans + 1`.
If `n` is `7`, then `ans` becomes `ans + 1`.
If `n` is `8`, then `ans` becomes `ans + 1`.
If `n` is `9`, then `ans` becomes `ans + 1`.
If `n` is `10`, then `ans` becomes `ans + 1`.
If `n` is `11`, then `ans` becomes `ans + 1`.
If `n` is `12`, then `ans` becomes `ans + 1`.
If `n` is `13`, then `ans` becomes `ans + 1`.
If `n` is `14`, then `ans` becomes `ans + 1`.
If `n` is `15`, then `ans` becomes `ans + 1`.
If `n` is `16`, then `ans` becomes `ans + 2`.

Thus, the exact increment to `ans` depends on `n`, but it is always an integer division of `(n + 3)` by `9`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 6, `i` is 3, `m` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + 3) // 9`.**
