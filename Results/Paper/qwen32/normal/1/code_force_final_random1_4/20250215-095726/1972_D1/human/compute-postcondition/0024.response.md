Functionality: **The function `func_12` calculates and updates the rank of a given node `da` in a graph represented by a dictionary `d`. It recursively explores the neighbors of `da` (stored in `d[da]`), ensuring no cycles are revisited using the `processing` list. If `da` has only one neighbor, it returns 1. Otherwise, it computes the minimum rank among its neighbors and assigns `tmp + 1` to `rank[da - 1]`, where `tmp` is the smallest value returned by recursive calls.**
