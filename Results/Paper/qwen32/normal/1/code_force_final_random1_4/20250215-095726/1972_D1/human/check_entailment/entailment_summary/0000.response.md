### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided functions to see if they collectively solve this problem:

- **Function 1 to 11**: These functions handle input reading and parsing. They read integers and lists of integers from standard input. This part seems correctly implemented for reading the input format specified in the problem.

- **Function 13**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers along with the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. While this function is useful for mathematical computations, it does not directly solve the problem of counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).

- **Function 14**: This function appears to be unrelated to the problem. It checks if a list of integers can be adjusted to meet a certain condition involving a threshold `m` and a decrement `k`. It doesn't seem relevant to counting pairs \((a, b)\) as required.

- **Function 15**: This function calculates a value based on the sum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + j}{j^2} \right\rfloor\) for \(j\) from 1 to \(i - 1\), where \(i\) is determined by the condition \(i^2 \leq n + i\). The function returns this calculated sum minus one. However, this formula does not correspond to the problem of counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- **Function 16**: This function orchestrates the process by reading the number of test cases and applying `func_15` to each test case. Since `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic for counting valid pairs, `func_16` will not produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:

Given that `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic for counting the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
