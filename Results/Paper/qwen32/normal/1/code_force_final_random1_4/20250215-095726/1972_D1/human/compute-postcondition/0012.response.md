To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and terminates. The loop continues as long as the condition `i * i <= n + i` holds true. Let's break down the process:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers returned by `func_7()`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - In each iteration, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`.

3. **Stopping Condition**:
   - The loop stops when `i * i > n + i`.

From the given output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration: `i` becomes 2, and `ans` becomes `(n + 1) // 1`.
- After 2 iterations: `i` becomes 3, and `ans` becomes `(n + 1) + ((n + 2) // 4)`.
- After 3 iterations: `i` becomes 4, and `ans` becomes `(n + 1) + ((n + 2) // 4) + ((n + 3) // 9)`.

The loop will continue until `i * i > n + i`. To find the exact final state, we need to determine the maximum value of `i` that satisfies `i * i <= n + i`.

Let's denote the final value of `i` as `i_final`. At this point, `i_final * i_final > n + i_final`, but `(i_final - 1) * (i_final - 1) <= n + (i_final - 1)`.

Thus, the final value of `ans` will be the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i_final - 1`.

Since we do not have specific values for `n` and `m`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can express the final state in terms of `n` and `m`:

- `i` will be `i_final` such that `i_final * i_final > n + i_final`.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `ans` will be the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i_final - 1`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers returned by `func_7()`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i` for the last valid `i`, `ans` is the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the loop runs until `i * i` exceeds `n + i`, and `ans` accumulates the sum of the integer divisions `(n + j) // (j * j)` for each valid `j`.
