Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The function `func_15()` and its usage in `func_16()` do not implement the logic required to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here's a brief overview of what the program should do:
- For each test case, it should iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given constraints.
- For each pair, it should check if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- It should count and print the number of such valid pairs for each test case.

The current implementation of `func_15()` calculates something related to divisors but does not address the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect for solving the given problem.
