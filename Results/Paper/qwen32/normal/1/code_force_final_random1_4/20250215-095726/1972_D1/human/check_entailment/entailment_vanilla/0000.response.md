To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem described. Let's break down the problem and the provided code.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Code Analysis
The provided code consists of several functions, but only `func_15` and `func_16` seem relevant to solving the problem. Here's what these functions do:

- `func_15`: This function takes two integers \(n\) and \(m\) and calculates something related to the number of valid pairs. However, it does not use \(m\) at all in its calculations, which suggests it might not be fully implementing the required logic.
- `func_16`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, printing the result.

Let's examine `func_15` more closely:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This function seems to be counting something related to divisors, but it doesn't consider the second part of the condition involving \(b\) and \(\gcd(a, b)\). Specifically, it doesn't check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. A more efficient approach would involve leveraging properties of divisors and gcd, but the current implementation does not do this.

### Conclusion
Given that `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to check the condition involving \(b\) and \(\gcd(a, b)\), the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
