Precondition: **This function does not have parameters in its signature, so there are no variables to describe. However, based on the context, it seems to rely on other functions (`func_10` and `func_15`) which likely handle the input values `n` and `m`. Therefore, indirectly, we can infer that `func_10` returns the number of test cases `t`, and `func_15` computes the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each test case given `n` and `m`.**
