You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates a final value `year` for each test case based on the provided integers and prints this value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem requires us to find the year in which the n-th sign occurs, considering that each subsequent sign can only occur after the previous one. Specifically, if the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the next sign (i+1) can only occur in a year `y` such that `y > x` and `y` is a multiple of `a_(i+1)`.

Here's how the program works:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of signs `n`.
   - It reads the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`. This expression ensures that `year` is updated to the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`.

Let's analyze the expression `year += year % ai or ai`:
- `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If this remainder is non-zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`.
- `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai` if `year % ai` is zero (meaning `year` is already a multiple of `ai`), and to `year % ai` otherwise.
- Adding this result to `year` effectively moves `year` to the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`.

This logic correctly simulates the process of waiting for each sign to occur sequentially, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.
