### Reasoning:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen according to the problem statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes `year` to 0, representing the start of the timeline.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign:
     - `year += year % ai or ai`
     - This expression ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `year + 1`. If `year % ai` is non-zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and we need to add the difference to reach the next multiple. If `year % ai` is zero, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, and we simply add `ai` to move to the next occurrence.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final value of `year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the first test case from the example:

- Input: `6`, `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- Initial `year` is `0`.
- First sign: `year = 0 + (0 % 3 or 3) = 3`
- Second sign: `year = 3 + (3 % 2 or 2) = 4`
- Third sign: `year = 4 + (4 % 4 or 4) = 8`
- Fourth sign: `year = 8 + (8 % 5 or 5) = 10`
- Fifth sign: `year = 10 + (10 % 9 or 9) = 18`
- Sixth sign: `year = 18 + (18 % 18 or 18) = 36`

The output matches the expected result for this test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case based on the given periodicities. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

**Correctness: True**
