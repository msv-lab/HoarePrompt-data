Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), and the third tuple in `test_cases` must have a non-empty list as its second element; `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `current_year` is 0; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least one element. If `current_year % ai == 0` for some `ai` in the list `a` from the third tuple in `test_cases`, then `next_year` is set to that `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to the first element of `a`.**
