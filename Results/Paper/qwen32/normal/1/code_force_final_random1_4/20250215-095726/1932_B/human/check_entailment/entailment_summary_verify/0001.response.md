Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the logic behind the expression `year += year % ai or ai` to ensure its correctness according to the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Expression `year += year % ai or ai`:**
   - The expression `year % ai` computes the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
   - The expression `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai` if `year % ai` is zero (meaning `year` is already a multiple of `ai`), and to `year % ai` otherwise. However, this interpretation is incorrect because `year % ai or ai` will always evaluate to `ai` if `year % ai` is zero, and to `year % ai` if `year % ai` is non-zero. But since `year % ai` cannot be used directly to determine the next multiple, we need to adjust the logic.
   - The correct way to move `year` to the next multiple of `ai` is to use `year = (year // ai + 1) * ai` if `year % ai != 0`, otherwise `year` remains the same if `year % ai == 0`.

2. **Correct Logic for Moving to the Next Multiple:**
   - If `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, it should remain `year`.
   - If `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, it should be updated to the next multiple of `ai`, which is `(year // ai + 1) * ai`.

3. **Revised Expression:**
   - The correct expression to update `year` should be `year = (year // ai + 1) * ai` if `year % ai != 0`, otherwise `year` remains the same.
   - This can be simplified to `year += (ai - year % ai) % ai`. This ensures that `year` is moved to the next multiple of `ai` if it is not already a multiple.

### Correct Implementation:
The correct implementation should look like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += (ai - year % ai) % ai
        print(year)
```

### Re-evaluation of the Original Program:
The original program uses `year += year % ai or ai`, which does not correctly compute the next multiple of `ai`. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
