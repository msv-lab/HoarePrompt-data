The only variable in the loop head is `ai`, which represents the current element being iterated over in the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `ai` to the next element in the list `a`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).
- `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`.
- `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least two elements.
- `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.
- `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` was the second element in the list `a`. For the next iteration, `ai` should be the third element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least two elements; `ai` is the third element in the list `a`; `current_year` is equal to `next_year`**
