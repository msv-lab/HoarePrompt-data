To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the inner loop and how it affects the variable `year`. The outer loop runs `t` times, and for each iteration, it processes a list of integers `a` and calculates the final value of `year` based on the provided logic.

Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Outer Loop**: Runs `t` times.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each iteration of the outer loop, it processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`. The variable `year` is initialized to 0 at the start of each outer loop iteration.
3. **Logic Inside Inner Loop**: For each integer `ai` in the list `a`, the value of `year` is updated using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`. This means:
   - If `year % ai` is non-zero, `year` is incremented by `year % ai`.
   - If `year % ai` is zero, `year` is incremented by `ai`.

After all iterations of the outer loop have completed, the final value of `year` for each test case is printed.

### Final Output State

Since the loop runs `t` times, and for each test case (each iteration of the outer loop), the value of `year` is calculated independently and printed, the final output state will be a series of `t` lines, each containing the final value of `year` for the corresponding test case.

### Conclusion

The output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is a series of `t` lines, each representing the final value of `year` for each test case.

Output State: **A series of `t` lines, each line containing the final value of `year` after processing the list `a` for each test case.**

In simpler terms, the output state is a list of `t` final `year` values, one for each test case.
