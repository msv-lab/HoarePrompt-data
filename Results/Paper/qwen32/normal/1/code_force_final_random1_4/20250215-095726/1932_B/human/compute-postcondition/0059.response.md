The given code snippet is `current_year = next_year`. This line assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`.

Given the initial state, `current_year` and `next_year` are not explicitly defined in terms of specific values, but their relationship is updated by this line of code. After executing this line, `current_year` will have the same value as `next_year`.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least two elements; `ai` is the second element in the list `a`; `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.**

In simpler terms, `current_year` now holds the same value as `next_year`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
