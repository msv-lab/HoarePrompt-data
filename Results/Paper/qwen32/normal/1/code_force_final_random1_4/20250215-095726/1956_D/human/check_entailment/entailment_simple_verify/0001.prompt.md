You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to be designed to handle the case where `l == r`, setting `a[l]` to 0 if it's not already 0 and recording the operation.
   - For the general case (`l < r`), it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`, and then checks if `a[l]` needs to be updated to `r - l + 1`. If it does, it performs the operation and updates the array.
   - However, there is a critical issue here: `func_1` is modifying the global variable `ops` without passing it as a parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which means the operations won't be recorded properly.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - It checks if the current sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` and then sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - If the sum condition is not met, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and splits the subarray around this maximum element, recursively calling itself on the left and right parts.
   - Similar to `func_1`, this function also modifies the global `ops` list without passing it as a parameter.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and prints the results.
   - Since `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` do not correctly pass and modify the `ops` list, the operations recorded will be incomplete or incorrect.

### Issues Identified:
- The functions `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` modify a global `ops` list without passing it as a parameter. This leads to incorrect recording of operations.
- The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` for splitting the array around the maximum element and updating the array might not be optimal for maximizing the sum.
- The overall structure of the program does not ensure that the operations are correctly recorded and applied.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, particularly the incorrect handling of the `ops` list and the potential inefficiency in maximizing the sum, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
