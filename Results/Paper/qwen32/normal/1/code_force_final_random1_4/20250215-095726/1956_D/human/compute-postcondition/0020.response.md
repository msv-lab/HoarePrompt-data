Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a). If `s` is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), then `a[i]` is `r - l + 1` for all `i` in `[l, r]`, `s` is adjusted accordingly, `result` is returned, and `ops` contains an additional tuple `(l, r)`. Otherwise, `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.**
