The code finds the index of the maximum value (`mx`) within the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and adds `l` to it to get the position of `mx` in the original list `a`. This new position is stored in the variable `pos`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the variable `pos` which holds the calculated value.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a); `s` is the sum of the elements from index l to r (inclusive) in the list a and is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1); `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1]; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`.**
