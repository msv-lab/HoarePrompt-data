Functionality: **The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers from the input, computes the sum and maximum of the list, prints these values, and then prints a series of operations (if any) returned by another function `func_2`. The final state includes the printed sum and maximum of the list, along with any additional operations.**
