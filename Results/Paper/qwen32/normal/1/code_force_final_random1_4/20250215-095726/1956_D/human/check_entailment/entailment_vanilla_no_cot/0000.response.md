Correctness: **False**

The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing the array `a` or the operations list `ops`. This will cause a `NameError` because `a` and `ops` are not defined within the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies the array `a` but does not pass it back to `func_2`, so the changes made to `a` inside `recursive_maximize_sum` are not reflected in `func_2`.

3. The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` in `recursive_maximize_sum` is not appropriate for determining when to apply the MEX operation. Instead, the function should calculate the MEX of the subarray and decide whether to replace the subarray with this MEX value.

4. The logic for splitting the array and recursively processing each part is not correctly implemented. The function should ensure that the entire array is processed and that the MEX operation is applied optimally to maximize the sum.

5. The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the case where `l == r`, but it incorrectly sets `a[l]` to `0` instead of calculating the MEX.

6. The function `func_3` reads the input and prints the result, but it relies on `func_2` to return the correct sum and operations, which it does not due to the issues mentioned above.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be rewritten to correctly calculate the MEX for each subarray and apply the operations to maximize the sum while keeping track of the operations performed.
