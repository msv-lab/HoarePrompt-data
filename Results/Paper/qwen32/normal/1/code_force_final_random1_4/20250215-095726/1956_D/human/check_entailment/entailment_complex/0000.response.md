### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their roles in solving the problem:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is designed to modify the array `a` by setting subarrays to a specific value based on the condition that the sum of the subarray should match the length of the subarray.
   - It recursively processes the array from the leftmost element to the rightmost element.
   - If the current segment of the array does not meet the condition (sum of elements is not equal to the length of the segment), it sets all elements in the segment to the length of the segment and records the operation in `ops`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
   - It then returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the results.
   - It also prints the operations in the required format.

4. **Function 4 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
   - This function is supposed to recursively split the array into segments and apply the MEX operation to maximize the sum.
   - However, there is a critical issue here: the function does not properly define or use the `ops` list. Instead, it references `ops` without defining it within its scope, leading to a `NameError`.

### Issues Identified:
- The primary issue is the undefined `ops` variable in `recursive_maximize_sum`. Since `ops` is defined in `func_2` but not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, the function will fail at runtime.
- The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` seems to aim to split the array around the maximum element, but it does not correctly implement the MEX operation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly the undefined `ops` variable in `recursive_maximize_sum`, the program will not execute correctly as intended. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
