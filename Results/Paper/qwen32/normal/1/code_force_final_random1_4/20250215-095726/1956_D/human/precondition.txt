a is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(a) ≤ 18 and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7 for each element a_i in a. l and r are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ len(a). ops is a list that will store the operations performed, where each operation is represented by a tuple (l, r).
