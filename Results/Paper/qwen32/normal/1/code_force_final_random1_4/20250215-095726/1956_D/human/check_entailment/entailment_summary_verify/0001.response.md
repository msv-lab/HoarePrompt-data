### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Function Summaries and Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to handle the case where `l == r` and set `a[l]` to 0 if it's not already 0, recording the operation in `ops`.
   - For `l < r`, it recursively processes the subarray and updates the array if necessary.
   - The function modifies the global `ops` list directly, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs because `ops` is not passed as a parameter.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Initializes the `ops` list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, meaning operations won't be recorded correctly.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - Calculates the sum of the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - Checks if the current sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` and sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - If the sum condition is not met, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and splits the subarray around this maximum element, recursively calling itself on the left and right parts.
   - Similar to `func_1`, this function modifies the global `ops` list directly.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and prints the results.
   - Since `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` do not correctly pass and modify the `ops` list, the operations recorded will be incomplete or incorrect.

### Issues Identified:

- **Global Variable Usage**: Both `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` modify a global `ops` list directly. This is problematic because it can lead to incorrect or inconsistent state management.
- **Parameter Passing**: The `ops` list is not passed as a parameter to `recursive_maximize_sum`, leading to incorrect recording of operations.
- **Logic for Maximizing Sum**: The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` for splitting the array around the maximum element and updating the array might not be optimal for maximizing the sum.

### Correctness Evaluation:

Given the identified issues, particularly the incorrect handling of the `ops` list and the potential inefficiency in maximizing the sum, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the analysis, the program is incorrect due to improper handling of the operations list and potential inefficiencies in the logic for maximizing the sum.

**Final: False**
