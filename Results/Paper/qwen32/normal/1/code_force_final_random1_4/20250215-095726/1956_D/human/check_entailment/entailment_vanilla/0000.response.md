Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function Definitions:
1. **func_1(a, l, r, ops)**:
   - This function is supposed to recursively process a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if the element at `l` is not `0`. If not, it sets it to `0` and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray from `l + 1` to `r`.
   - After the recursive call, it checks if the element at `l` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
   - The logic seems intended to ensure that the MEX value is applied correctly, but there are issues with how it handles the operations and the array.

2. **func_2(a)**:
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
   - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `a` array and `ops` list, leading to undefined behavior.

3. **recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1(a, l, r, ops)` and then sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and splits the problem into two subproblems around the position of the maximum value.
   - Similar to `func_1`, it also suffers from the issue of not being passed the `a` array and `ops` list.

4. **func_3()**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2(a)`, and prints the result.
   - It correctly handles input/output operations but relies on the correctness of `func_2`.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Scope and Passing of Variables**: Both `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` are defined to modify the array `a` and the operations list `ops`, but they are not passed these variables correctly when called. This leads to undefined behavior and potential errors.
- **Logic for MEX Calculation**: The logic for calculating the MEX and updating the array might not be optimal or correct for all cases. The current approach seems to rely on setting the entire subarray to `r - l + 1`, which may not always yield the maximum possible sum.
- **Handling of Operations**: The operations list `ops` is not properly managed across the recursive calls, leading to incorrect recording of operations.

### Conclusion
Given the identified issues, particularly the improper handling of variable scope and the logic for maximizing the sum using MEX operations, the provided program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
