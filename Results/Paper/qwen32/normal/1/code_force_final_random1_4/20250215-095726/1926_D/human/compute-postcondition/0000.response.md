The given code snippet initializes a variable `res` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31; `res` is 0.**
