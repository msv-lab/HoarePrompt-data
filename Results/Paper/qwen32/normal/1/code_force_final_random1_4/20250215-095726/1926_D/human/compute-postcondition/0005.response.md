Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31 and `a` must have at least one element; `res` is 1; `count` is a dictionary with one entry `{(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num: 1}`.**

Natural Language: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
