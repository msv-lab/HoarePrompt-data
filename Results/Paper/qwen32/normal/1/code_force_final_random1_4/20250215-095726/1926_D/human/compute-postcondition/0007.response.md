Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31 and `a` must have at least one element; `res` is 0; `count` is a dictionary and `num` is already a key in `count` with its value decreased by 1.**

Natural Language: The value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `count` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
