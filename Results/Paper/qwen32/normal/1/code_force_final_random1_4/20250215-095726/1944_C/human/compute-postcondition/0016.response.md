Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1, the count of the element at index 1 decreased by 1, and the count of the element at index 2 decreased by 1 (but still at least 0). `start` is 2. `vis` is `{0, 1}`.**

Explanation: The value of `start` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
