The code adds the value of `start` (which is 1) to the set `vis`. Initially, `vis` contains only the element 0. After adding 1 to `vis`, `vis` will contain both 0 and 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1 and the count of the element at index 1 set to at least 1. `start` is 1. `vis` is `{0, 1}`.**
