Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1, the count of the element at index 1 decreased by 1, and the count of the element at index 2 decreased by 1. If `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0, `start` is updated to 3, and `vis` remains `{0, 1, 2}`. Otherwise, the program returns nothing (None).**
