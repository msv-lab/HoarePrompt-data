Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1. The count of the element at index `start + 1` in `nums` is greater than 0. `start` is 0. `vis` is {0}.**
