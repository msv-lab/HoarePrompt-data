To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0
- `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input collected during each iteration of the loop)
- `ans` is `'YES'`
- `impossible` is `False` if either the element at position `j` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the element at position `j` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`). Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.
- The first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`).

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have taken on a value from `0` to `m - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` should be incremented by 1.
- `m` remains unchanged as it defines the range of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input collected during each iteration of the loop), `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` is `False` if either the element at position `j` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the element at position `j` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`). Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. The first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `j` is incremented by 1**.

Since `j` was at some value `k` (where `0 <= k < m - 1`), it will now be `k + 1`. Therefore, the precise state for the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input collected during each iteration of the loop), `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` is `False` if either the element at position `j` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the element at position `j` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`). Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. The first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `j` is `previous_j + 1`**.

If we assume `previous_j` was the value of `j` at the end of the last iteration, then the new value of `j` is `previous_j + 1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input collected during each iteration of the loop), `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` is `False` if either the element at position `j` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the element at position `j` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`). Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. The first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `j` is `previous_j + 1`**.

For clarity, let's assume `previous_j` was 0 (the first iteration), then `j` would be 1 for the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input collected during each iteration of the loop), `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` is `False` if either the element at position `j` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the element at position `j` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`). Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. The first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `j` is 1**.

This is the state for the next iteration assuming `previous_j` was 0. For a general case where `previous_j` could be any value from 0 to `m-2`, the state would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input collected during each iteration of the loop), `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` is `False` if either the element at position `j` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the element at position `j` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`). Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. The first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `j` is `previous_j + 1`**.
