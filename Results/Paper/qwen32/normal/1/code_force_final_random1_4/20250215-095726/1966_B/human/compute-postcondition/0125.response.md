Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `i` is `n - 2`, the first element of the sublist at index `i` in `gr` is not equal to the element at position `m - 1` in the last sublist of `gr`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `'NO'`, `impossible` is `False`.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is setting `impossible` to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values.
