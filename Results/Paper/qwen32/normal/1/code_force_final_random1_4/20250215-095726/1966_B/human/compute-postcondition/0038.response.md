Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `ans` is `'NO'`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `i` is `n - 2`. If `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` remains `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` is not modified.**
