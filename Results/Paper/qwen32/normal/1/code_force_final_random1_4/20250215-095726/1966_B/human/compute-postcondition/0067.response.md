Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 2, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` is `False` if `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, otherwise `impossible` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1.**
