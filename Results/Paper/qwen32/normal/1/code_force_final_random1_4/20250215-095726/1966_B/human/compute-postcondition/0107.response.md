Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i` + 1, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all inputs provided during the loop), `tc` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `i` is `n` - 1, `ans` is `'YES'`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the element at position `m - 1` in the last sublist of `gr`, `j` is 1, `impossible` is False.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `impossible` has been set to `False`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged from the initial state.
