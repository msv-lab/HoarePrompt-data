The code appends a new user input to the list `gr`. The initial state specifies that `gr` is a list containing two elements. After appending the new user input, `gr` will now contain three elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing three elements (the first being the original first user input, the second being the original second user input, and the third being the new user input), `i` is 2.**
