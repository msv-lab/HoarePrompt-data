Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that `t` >= 1.
   - `n`: The first integer from the input, representing the number of strings in `gr`.
   - `m`: The second integer from the input, representing the length of each string in `gr`.
   - `gr`: A list containing `n` elements, where each element is an input string of length `m`.
   - `tc`: Incremented by `n` (not directly relevant to the `print(ans)` statement).
   - `impossible`: Remains unchanged (not directly relevant to the `print(ans)` statement).

2. **Logic for Determining `ans`:**
   - If the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), then `ans` is set to `'NO'` and `i` is set to `n - 2`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.

### Code Execution:

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Determining the Value of `ans`:

- **Condition Check**: 
  - The condition checks if `gr[0][0]` (first character of the first string) is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` (last character of the last string).
  - Depending on this condition, `ans` is either `'NO'` or `'YES'`.

### Output:

Given the logic, the output will be either `'NO'` or `'YES'` based on the condition mentioned above. Since the specific values of `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact output value. However, we know it will be one of these two strings.

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **ans (where ans is 'NO' if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1], otherwise 'YES')**
