Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is an empty list, `tc` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless the conditions for changing it are met in the loop body, `impossible` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    gr.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` contains one more element which is the input, `tc` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless changed, `impossible` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` contains two more elements (one more element which is the input), `tc` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless changed, `impossible` remains unchanged, `i` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than 5, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` contains two more elements (one more element which is the input), `tc` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless changed, `impossible` remains unchanged, `i` is 5. The list `gr` now includes the newly appended input element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
