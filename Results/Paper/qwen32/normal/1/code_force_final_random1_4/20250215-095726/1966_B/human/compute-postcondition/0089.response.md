The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tc` and `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` has been incremented by `n`, and `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `tc` must be incremented by 1 (not by `n` as it was in the previous iteration) because the loop iterates over `tc` in the range of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), `tc` is incremented by 1, `impossible` remains unchanged. If the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), then `ans` is `'NO'` and `i` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.**
