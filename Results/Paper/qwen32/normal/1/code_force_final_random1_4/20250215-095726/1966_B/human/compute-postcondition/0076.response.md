Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `impossible` is `False` if either the first character of the `i`-th string in `gr` (`gr[i][0]`) is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)`-th string in `gr` (`gr[i + 1][0]`), or the `m`-th character of the `i`-th string in `gr` (`gr[i][m - 1]`) is not equal to the `m`-th character of the `(i+1)`-th string in `gr` (`gr[i + 1][m - 1]`). Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. `ans` is `'NO'` in both cases.**
