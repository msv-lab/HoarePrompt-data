You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:

    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        ans = 'YES'
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with 'W' or 'B'. It determines if it's possible to paint the grid such that all cells are the same color ('W' or 'B') by only changing the colors of the cells on the border of the grid. For each test case, it outputs 'YES' if such a painting is possible, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Operation Definition**: Select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.
2. **Objective**: Determine if all squares in the grid can be made the same color using any number of operations.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`) and the grid itself.
2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have different colors.
   - If they are different, it proceeds to check if there is a possibility to make the entire grid the same color.
3. **Checking Rows and Columns**:
   - It checks if all elements in the first row are the same and all elements in the last row are the same.
   - Similarly, it checks if all elements in the first column are the same and all elements in the last column are the same.
   - If either the first and last rows or the first and last columns have alternating colors, it concludes that it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above checks, the program prints "YES" if it's possible to make the grid uniform in color, otherwise "NO".

#### Flaws in the Logic:
- The program only checks the first and last rows and columns for uniformity. This is insufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.
- Consider a grid where the first and last rows and columns are uniform, but there are alternating patterns in the middle. The program would incorrectly conclude that the grid can be made uniform.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
W B W
B W B
W B W
```
Here, the first and last rows and columns are uniform, but it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases and may give incorrect results for certain grid configurations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
