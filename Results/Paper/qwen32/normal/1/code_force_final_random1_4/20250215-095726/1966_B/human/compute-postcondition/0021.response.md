The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `previous_j + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `j` was `previous_j + 1` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `previous_j + 2`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `previous_j`, we can denote the new value of `j` simply as `j = j + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input collected during each iteration of the loop), `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` is `False` if either the element at position `j` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the element at position `j` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`). Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. The first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `j` is `j + 1`**
