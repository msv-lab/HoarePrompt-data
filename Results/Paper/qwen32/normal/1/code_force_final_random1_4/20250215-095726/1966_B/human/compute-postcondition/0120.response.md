Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the element at position `m - 1` in the last sublist of `gr`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `'NO'`. If the first element of the sublist at index `i` in `gr` is not equal to the first element of the sublist at index `i + 1` in `gr`, or the element at position `m - 1` in the sublist at index `i` in `gr` is not equal to the element at position `m - 1` in the sublist at index `i + 1` in `gr`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**
