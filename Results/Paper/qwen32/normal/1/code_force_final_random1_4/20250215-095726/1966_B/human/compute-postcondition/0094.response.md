The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented further, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `tc` is incremented by 1, these variables are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged in terms of the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input provided, `tc` is incremented by 1, `impossible` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
