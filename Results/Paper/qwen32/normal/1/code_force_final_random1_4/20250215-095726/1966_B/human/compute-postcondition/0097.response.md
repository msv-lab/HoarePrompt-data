The code appends a new input to the list `gr`. Given the initial state, `gr` already contains two elements (the original input and the new input `m`). After appending another input, `gr` will now contain three elements.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that `t` >= 1.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
- `m` remains the second integer from the new input.
- `gr` is now a list containing three elements: the original input, the new input `m`, and the latest input appended by the code.
- `tc` is incremented by 1.
- `impossible` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `gr` is a list containing three elements (the original input, the new input `m`, and the latest input), `tc` is incremented by 1, `impossible` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`.**
