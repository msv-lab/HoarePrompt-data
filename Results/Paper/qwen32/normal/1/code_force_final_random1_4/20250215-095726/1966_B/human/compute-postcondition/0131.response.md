Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is `'YES'` unless `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, in which case `ans` is `'NO'` and `impossible` is set to `True` if there exists at least one pair of consecutive sublists in `gr` with differing first or last elements. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `False`.**
