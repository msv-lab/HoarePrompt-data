The provided code snippet updates the values of `n` and `m` by reading two integers from the input. This means the previous values of `n` and `m` are overwritten. The other variables (`t`, `gr`, `tc`, `impossible`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged unless their conditions are met later in the code.

Given the initial state, the only changes are to `n` and `m` which are now assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), `tc` is incremented by 1, `impossible` remains unchanged. If the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), then `ans` is `'NO'` and `i` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.**
