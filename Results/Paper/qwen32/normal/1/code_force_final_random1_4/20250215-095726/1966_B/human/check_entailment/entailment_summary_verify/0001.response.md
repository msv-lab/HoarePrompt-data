### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic against the problem description and the function summary.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Operation Definition**: Select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.
2. **Objective**: Determine if all squares in the grid can be made the same color using any number of operations.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`) and the grid itself.
2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have different colors.
   - If they are different, it proceeds to check if there is a possibility to make the entire grid the same color.
3. **Checking Rows and Columns**:
   - It checks if all elements in the first row are the same and all elements in the last row are the same.
   - Similarly, it checks if all elements in the first column are the same and all elements in the last column are the same.
   - If either the first and last rows or the first and last columns have alternating colors, it concludes that it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above checks, the program prints "YES" if it's possible to make the grid uniform in color, otherwise "NO".

#### Evaluation Against Function Summary:
The function summary suggests that the program determines if it's possible to paint the grid such that all cells are the same color by only changing the colors of the cells on the border of the grid. However, this is not entirely accurate. The program checks the first and last rows and columns for uniformity, which is a necessary condition but not sufficient.

#### Correctness of the Program:
The program's logic is flawed because it only checks the first and last rows and columns for uniformity. This is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. There could be internal patterns within the grid that prevent it from being made uniform even if the borders are uniform.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
W B W
B W B
W B W
```
Here, the first and last rows and columns are uniform, but it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the allowed operations.

However, let's consider another perspective:
- If the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color, and the first and last rows and columns are uniform, then it is indeed possible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because you can use the uniform rows and columns to propagate the color throughout the grid.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the operations, the program's logic seems to be correct under the assumption that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same and the borders are uniform, the grid can be made uniform. The original assessment seems to have overcomplicated the issue by providing a counterexample that doesn't fit the specific checks performed by the program.

### Conclusion:
Upon re-evaluating the program, it appears that the logic is correct given the specific checks it performs. The program correctly identifies cases where the grid can be made uniform based on the conditions it checks.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
