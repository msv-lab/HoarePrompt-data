Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input collected during each iteration of the loop).**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged as it was initially. The variable `n` determines how many times the loop runs, and since the loop runs `n` times, `gr` will contain exactly `n` user inputs collected one by one during each iteration. The value of `m` also remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
