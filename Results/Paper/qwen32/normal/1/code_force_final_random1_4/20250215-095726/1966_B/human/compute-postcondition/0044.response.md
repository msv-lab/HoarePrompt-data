Let's analyze the given initial state and determine the value of `ans` that will be printed:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 0.
   - `m` is an integer.
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` elements.
   - If `n` is at least 2 and `m` is at least 2, and `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is set to `'NO'`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.

2. **Determining the Value of `ans`:**
   - The value of `ans` depends on the conditions involving `n`, `m`, and the elements of the list `gr`.
   - If `n < 2` or `m < 2`, the condition `n >= 2 and m >= 2` is not met, so `ans` remains `'YES'`.
   - If `n >= 2` and `m >= 2`, the condition further checks if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`. If this inequality holds, `ans` is set to `'NO'`; otherwise, it remains `'YES'`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and the contents of `gr` are not provided, we cannot definitively say whether the condition `n >= 2 and m >= 2` and the subsequent comparison `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` will be true or false.
   - However, based on the given conditions, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Given the above analysis, the output will depend on the specific values of `n`, `m`, and the elements of `gr`. Therefore, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **ans (where ans is 'NO' if n >= 2, m >= 2, and gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1], otherwise 'YES')**
