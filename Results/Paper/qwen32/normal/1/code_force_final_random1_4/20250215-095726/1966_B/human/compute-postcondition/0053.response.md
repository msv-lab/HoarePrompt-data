The code appends a new element to the list `gr`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `gr`, which now contains one additional element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than 5, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` contains two more elements (one more element which is the input), `tc` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless changed, `impossible` remains unchanged, `i` is 5. The list `gr` now includes the newly appended input element.**
