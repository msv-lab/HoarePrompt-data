Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to divide the books into two non-empty piles and maximize the sum of the largest book in each pile. The key point here is that we need to consider all possible ways to split the books into two piles and choose the division that gives the maximum sum of the largest books in each pile.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided code snippet does not correctly solve the problem. Here’s why:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

#### Explanation of the Code:
1. The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.
3. It calculates the maximum number of pages in all books except the last one (`max(nums[:-1])`) and adds it to the number of pages in the last book (`nums[-1]`).
4. It prints this sum as the result.

#### Issues with the Code:
- The code does not consider all possible ways to split the books into two non-empty piles.
- It assumes that the optimal solution is always to take the largest book from all but the last book and add it to the last book. This is not necessarily true.
- The code fails to check other possible splits, which might yield a higher sum.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we should:
1. Sort the list of books by the number of pages in descending order.
2. Consider the two largest books; these will be the ones that maximize the sum when placed in separate piles.

Here’s how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
