Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to be the integer value obtained from the input. The preconditions for `n` and the list of integers remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
