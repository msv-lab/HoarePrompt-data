Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to divide the books into two non-empty piles and maximize the sum of the largest book from each pile. However, the current implementation simply adds the largest book from the first `n-1` books to the last book, which does not guarantee that this division results in the maximum possible sum.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible ways to split the books into two non-empty piles and calculate the sum of the largest book in each pile for each split. The maximum of these sums is the answer.

The current implementation fails to explore all possible splits and thus may not yield the correct result for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
