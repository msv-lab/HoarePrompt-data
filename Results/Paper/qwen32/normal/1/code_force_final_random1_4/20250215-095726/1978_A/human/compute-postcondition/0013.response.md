To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given code and the provided information step-by-step.

### Code Analysis:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

- The loop runs `t` times.
- In each iteration:
  - It reads an integer `n`.
  - It reads a list of `n` integers `nums`.
  - It prints the sum of the maximum value of the first `n-1` elements of `nums` and the last element of `nums`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100.
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.

### Iteration Details:
- After the first iteration, `t` decreases by 1.
- After the second iteration, `t` decreases by another 1.
- After the third iteration, `t` decreases by another 1.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will continue until `t` becomes 0.
- At the end of all iterations, `t` will be 0.
- The variables `n` and `nums` will hold the values from the most recent iteration, but they are not relevant to the final state since the loop terminates and no further iterations occur.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after all iterations is when `t` has reached 0. The values of `n` and `nums` from the last iteration do not affect the final state of `t`.

Output State: **t is 0.**
