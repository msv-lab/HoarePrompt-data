To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `tc` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.
- `dp` is a boolean value determined by the condition `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`.

### Key Points to Consider:
- Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and has a `0` appended at the end, the last two elements of `arr` are `arr[n-1] = 0` and `arr[n-2]` is the smallest non-zero unique integer in the list.
- The condition `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1` simplifies to `arr[n-2] > 1` because `arr[n-1]` is `0`.
- The value of `dp` is initially set based on the condition `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`. Given that `not dp` is always true when `dp` is initially undefined, the condition `arr[n-2] > 1` will determine the initial value of `dp`.

### Determining `dp`:
- If `arr[n-2] > 1`, then `dp` is `True`.
- If `arr[n-2] <= 1`, then `dp` is `False`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs `'Alice'` if `dp` is `True`, otherwise it outputs `'Bob'`.

### Conclusion:
- The output depends on whether the smallest non-zero unique integer in the list (`arr[n-2]`) is greater than 1 or not.
- If `arr[n-2] > 1`, `dp` is `True` and the output is `'Alice'`.
- If `arr[n-2] <= 1`, `dp` is `False` and the output is `'Bob'`.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `arr[n-2]` without the specific input list. However, we can describe the output based on the condition:

Output: **'Alice' if the smallest non-zero unique integer in the list is greater than 1, otherwise 'Bob'**.
