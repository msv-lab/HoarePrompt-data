You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    5
    
    3 3 3 3 3
    
    2
    
    1 7
    
    7
    
    1 3 9 7 4 2 100
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    6
    
    2 1 3 4 2 4
    
    8
    
    5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
    
    1
    
    1000000000

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

- Program:
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True) + [0]
        dp = True
        n = len(arr) - 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
        print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on the processed list of integers and prints the winner's name. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible cases. Specifically, the program uses a dynamic programming approach that is not correctly implemented for this problem. The key issue lies in how the game's outcome is determined based on the differences between sorted unique pile sizes.

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, and the winning strategy can be determined using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero at the start of a player's turn, that player is in a losing position if the opponent plays optimally. Otherwise, they are in a winning position.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Initial piles: `[1, 1, 2]`
- Nim-sum: `1 ^ 1 ^ 2 = 0`
- Since the Nim-sum is 0, Alice is in a losing position if both play optimally, so Bob wins.

However, the provided program would likely output "Alice" for this input because it incorrectly determines the winning condition based on the differences between sorted unique pile sizes.

Here is a corrected version of the program using the Nim-sum approach:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for num in arr:
            nim_sum ^= num
        print('Alice' if nim_sum != 0 else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not. This approach ensures the program works correctly for all possible inputs.
