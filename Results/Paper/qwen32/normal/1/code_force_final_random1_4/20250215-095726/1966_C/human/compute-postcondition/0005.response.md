The code snippet assigns the value of `len(arr) - 1` to the variable `n`. Given that `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end, the length of `arr` will be the number of unique integers plus one (for the appended `0`). Therefore, `n` will be the number of unique integers in the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` must be greater than 0; `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr`; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `dp` is `True`.**
