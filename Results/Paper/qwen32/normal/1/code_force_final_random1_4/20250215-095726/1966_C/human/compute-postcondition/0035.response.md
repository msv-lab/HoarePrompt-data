Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tc` is at least 1, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `n-2`, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus one and must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
