The code snippet `n = len(arr) - 1` updates the value of `n` to be the length of the list `arr` minus one. Given that `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end, the length of `arr` is `tc + 1` (since `tc` must be at least 2, and there's an additional `0` at the end). Therefore, `n` becomes `tc`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` must be at least 2; `n` is `tc`; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `i` is `n-1`; `dp` is `True`.**
