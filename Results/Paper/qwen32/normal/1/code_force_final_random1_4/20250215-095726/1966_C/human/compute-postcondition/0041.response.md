Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output:

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not directly affect the print statement.
2. **`tc`**: At least 1. This variable also does not directly affect the print statement.
3. **`arr`**: A new list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end.
4. **`i`**: Set to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr` minus one.
5. **`dp`**: Calculated as `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`. Initially, `dp` is not defined, but it seems like it should be set to a boolean value based on the condition.
6. **`n`**: The length of `arr` minus one and must be greater than 1.

### Key Variables for the Print Statement:

- **`dp`**: This is the critical variable that determines the output. It is evaluated as `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`. Since `dp` is used in the condition without being initialized, we need to assume it's being set in some previous part of the code that isn't shown here. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `dp` is initially `False` (a common default for such conditions).

### Evaluating `dp`:

Given that `arr` is sorted in descending order and has a `0` appended at the end, let's consider the possible values for `arr[n-2]` and `arr[n-1]`:

- `arr[n-2]` is the second last element in the sorted list.
- `arr[n-1]` is the last element in the list, which is `0`.

The condition `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1` simplifies to `arr[n-2] > 1` because `arr[n-1]` is `0`.

- If `arr[n-2] > 1`, then `dp` becomes `True`.
- If `arr[n-2] <= 1`, then `dp` remains `False`.

However, since `dp` is also part of the expression `or not dp`, the final value of `dp` depends on the initial assumption and the condition.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

This means:
- If `dp` is `True`, it prints `'Alice'`.
- If `dp` is `False`, it prints `'Bob'`.

### Conclusion:

Without the exact initial value of `dp` and the specific values in `arr`, we can only determine the output based on the condition `arr[n-2] > 1`.

- If `arr[n-2] > 1`, `dp` will be `True`, and the output will be `'Alice'`.
- If `arr[n-2] <= 1`, `dp` will be `False`, and the output will be `'Bob'`.

Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the condition.

### Final Output:

Output: **'Alice' if arr[n-2] > 1 else 'Bob' (where arr[n-2] is the second last element in the sorted list `arr`)**
