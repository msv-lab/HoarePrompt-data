To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions leading up to the `print` statement:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `tc` is at least 2.
   - `n` is set to `tc`.
   - `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end.
   - `i` is set to `n-2`.
   - `dp` is a boolean value determined by the condition: `dp` is `True` if `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1` or if any previous condition caused `dp` to become `False` and remained `False` until the end; otherwise, `dp` is `False`.

2. **Key Points**:
   - Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and has a `0` appended at the end, `arr[n-2]` is the second last element in the original list of unique integers, and `arr[n-1]` is the last element, which is `0`.
   - The condition for `dp` being `True` is `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1`. Given that `arr[n-1]` is `0`, this simplifies to checking if `arr[n-2] > 1`.

3. **Determining `dp`**:
   - If `arr[n-2]` (the second last element in the original list) is greater than `1`, then `dp` will be `True`.
   - If `arr[n-2]` is `1` or `0`, then `dp` will be `False`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print `'Alice'` if `dp` is `True` and `'Bob'` if `dp` is `False`.

Given the above analysis, the output depends on the value of `arr[n-2]`:
- If `arr[n-2] > 1`, the output will be `'Alice'`.
- If `arr[n-2] <= 1`, the output will be `'Bob'`.

Since the exact value of `arr[n-2]` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

Output: **'Alice' if `arr[n-2] > 1` else 'Bob' (where `arr[n-2]` is the second last element in the original list of unique integers)**
