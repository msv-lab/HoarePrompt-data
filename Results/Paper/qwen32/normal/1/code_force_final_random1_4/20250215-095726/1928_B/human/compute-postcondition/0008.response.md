To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `len(arr) - 1`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
- `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `arr[0] * arr[0]`.
- `tem` is `arr[0] * arr[0]`.
- `i` is `0`.

Since `i` is currently `0`, this means the loop has just finished its last iteration (because the loop runs while `i` is greater than or equal to `0`).

To execute one more time, `i` would need to be set to a value that is within the range specified by the loop. However, since `i` is already `0` and the loop decrements `i` in each iteration, there is no valid previous state for `i` that would allow the loop to run again because `i` would have to be `1` or greater initially to decrement to `0`.

Therefore, the loop cannot execute another iteration given the current state where `i` is `0`.

However, if we consider the state right before the last iteration, `i` would have been `1` (assuming `arr` has at least 2 elements).

So, the state at the start of the last iteration (which is the state we need to adjust to understand the previous iteration) would be:
- `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers.
- `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `arr[0] * arr[0]`.
- `tem` is `arr[0] * arr[0]`.
- `i` is `1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `arr[0] * arr[0]`, `tem` is `arr[0] * arr[0]`, `i` is `1`**
