To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the indices of the list `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last index (`len(arr) - 1`) down to `0`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`.
2. **Dependencies**:
   - The loop will execute if `len(arr)` is at least 1 because `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)` will generate a sequence of indices from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`.
   - If `len(arr)` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one element.
- The initial value of `i` before the loop starts is not directly relevant since `i` is set by the `range` function during each iteration.
- The variables `ans` and `tem` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state should be adjusted such that `arr` has at least one element.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1**
