Let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4 (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `n`: An input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5.
- `a`: A string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
- `s`: The input string (same as `a`).
- `pk`: 
  - `n / 2` if `n` is even.
  - `n // 2` if `n` is odd.
- `sl`: A list of characters from the string `s` (same as `list(s)`).
- `o`: The count of '1's in the string `s`.
- `z`: The count of '0's in the string `s`.
- `zero`: The total count of '0's in `s` (same as `z`).
- `one`: The total count of '1's in `s` (same as `o`).
- `lst`: A list containing indices where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.
  - `zero_perc` is calculated as `(zero / n) * 100`.
  - `one_perc` is calculated as `(one / n) * 100`.
- `mini`: The minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.
- `final`: A sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
  - If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is an empty list.
  - If `c1` (which is the integer value of `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains `[0]`.
  - Otherwise, `final` contains `[n]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Determine `pk`**: 
   - `pk` is the midpoint of the string `s`. If `n` is even, it is `n / 2`. If `n` is odd, it is `n // 2`.

2. **Count '0's and '1's**:
   - `o` and `one` represent the number of '1's in `s`.
   - `z` and `zero` represent the number of '0's in `s`.

3. **Calculate `zero_perc` and `one_perc`**:
   - `zero_perc = (zero / n) * 100`
   - `one_perc = (one / n) * 100`

4. **Construct `lst`**:
   - `lst` includes indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%.

5. **Determine `mini`**:
   - `mini` is the smallest difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`.

6. **Construct `final`**:
   - `final` contains indices from `lst` where the difference with `pk` is exactly `mini`.
   - If `final` is empty, check the percentage of '1's (`c1`):
     - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` becomes `[0]`.
     - Otherwise, `final` becomes `[n]`.

7. **Print Statement**:
   - The code prints the first element of `final`.

### Conclusion:
Given the construction of `final`, there are two primary cases:
- If `final` is not empty, it contains indices where the balance of '0's and '1's is optimal around the midpoint `pk`.
- If `final` is empty, it depends on the overall percentage of '1's in the string `s`:
  - If `c1 >= 50`, the entire string is considered balanced towards '1's, so `final` is `[0]`.
  - Otherwise, `final` is `[n]`.

Thus, the printed value will either be the first index in `lst` that meets the criteria or `0` or `n` based on the overall balance of '1's in the string.

### Final Output:
Output: **0 or n or the first element of lst (where lst contains indices where zero_perc and one_perc are >= 50%, and the difference with pk is minimized)**
