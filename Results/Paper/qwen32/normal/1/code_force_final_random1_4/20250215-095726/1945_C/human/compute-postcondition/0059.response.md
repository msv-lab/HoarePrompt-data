The code snippet `final.append(elem)` adds the value of `elem` to the list `final`. This means that the list `final` now contains one more element, which is the value of `elem`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `final`, which gains an additional element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing indices where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and `lst` must have at least one element; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list that includes `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini` for some `elem` in `lst` and now includes the new `elem`; `elem` is the next element in `lst` after the current `elem`.**
