The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. The other variables (`mini`, `c1`, and the condition that `c1` is less than 50) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing `n`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `c1` is less than 50.**
