The provided Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `lst`. This action does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`). Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `lst` which is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list.**
