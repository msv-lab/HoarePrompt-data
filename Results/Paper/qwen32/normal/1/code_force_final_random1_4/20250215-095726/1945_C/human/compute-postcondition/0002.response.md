The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. 

Given the initial state, `n` was already defined as an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\). However, the code snippet reassigns `n` to a new integer value provided by the input. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the new value of `n` is whatever integer is provided by the input, and it should still satisfy the condition \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.**
