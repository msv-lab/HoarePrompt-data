The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`. Therefore, we need to adjust `elem` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `mini` is the minimum of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.
- If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, then `final` is `[elem]` if it was previously empty, or it now contains two `elem`s if it already contained `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains `[]`.
- `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0.
- All other variables retain their original values or are unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` should be the next element in the list `lst`.

Let's denote the current value of `elem` at the end of the previous iteration as `elem_current`. The next value of `elem` should be the next element in `lst` after `elem_current`.

State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, then `final` is `[elem]` if it was previously empty, or it now contains two `elem`s if it already contained `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains `[]`. `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0. `n`, `s`, `pk`, `_`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `elem` is the next element in `lst` after `elem_current`.**
