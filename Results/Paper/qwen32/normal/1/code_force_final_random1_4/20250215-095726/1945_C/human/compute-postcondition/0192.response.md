Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, then `final` is `[elem]`. Otherwise, `final` remains `[]`. `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `_` is incremented by 1, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's encountered in the loop, `one` is the total count of '1's encountered in the loop, and `lst` contains at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50%.**
