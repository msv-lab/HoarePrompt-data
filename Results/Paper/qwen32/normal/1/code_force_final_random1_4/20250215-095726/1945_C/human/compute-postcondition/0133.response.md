The code snippet provided calculates `c1` as `o * 100 // n`. This operation does not affect the variables `mini` or `final` as they are not involved in the calculation. The only new variable introduced is `c1`, which is the result of the integer division of `o * 100` by `n`.

Given that `final` is currently an empty list and `mini` holds the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, these conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is an empty list; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**
