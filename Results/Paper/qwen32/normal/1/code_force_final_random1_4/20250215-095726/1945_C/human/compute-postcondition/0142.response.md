The code snippet provided is simply taking an integer input and assigning it to the variable `n`. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `n` now holds the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final)` is 0, then `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is set to `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` is set to a list containing `n`. If `len(final)` is not 0, `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements `elem` from `lst` such that `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `_` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer.**
