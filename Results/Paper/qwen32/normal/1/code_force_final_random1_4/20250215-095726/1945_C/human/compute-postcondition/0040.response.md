The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. No other variables are modified.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, the new value of `i` is used to compute `i + 1` for appending to `lst`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and now also contains the new value `i + 1`; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is `(zero * 100) // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
