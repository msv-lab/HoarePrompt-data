The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `lst` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `lst` will contain one element, which is `i + 1`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`mini` is 100000000; `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`); `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `_` is incremented by 1; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` with at least one additional '0' counted if the current character `s[i]` is '0'; `zero` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is `[i + 1]`; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.**
