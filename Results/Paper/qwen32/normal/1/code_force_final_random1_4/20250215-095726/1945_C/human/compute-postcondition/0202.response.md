The code snippet calculates the value of `c1` using the formula `o * 100 // n`. This operation does not affect the `final` list or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `c1`.

Output State: **`final` is an empty list, and it remains sorted in ascending order; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**
