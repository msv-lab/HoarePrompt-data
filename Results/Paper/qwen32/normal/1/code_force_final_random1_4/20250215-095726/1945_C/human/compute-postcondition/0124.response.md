The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `lst`. Since `lst` contains at least one element, the loop will execute as long as there are more elements to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `elem` was the last element processed from `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` needs to be updated to the next element in `lst`.

Since we don't know the specific elements of `lst` or their order, we can only describe the state in terms of the next element in the list.

State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, otherwise `final` remains an empty list; `lst` contains at least one element; `elem` is the next element in `lst`**
