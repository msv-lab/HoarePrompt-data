To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and `t`, which determines how many times the loop will iterate. Since `_` is not a variable we need to initialize or adjust, our focus is solely on `t`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Given the initial condition that `1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4`, the loop will definitely execute because `t` is already within a range that ensures at least one iteration.

However, since the task specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head and the initial state already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute, no further adjustments are needed.

Therefore, the state remains as given:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
