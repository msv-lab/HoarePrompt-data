The code appends `elem` to the list `final`. This means that regardless of the condition involving `mini` and `abs(pk - elem)`, `elem` is added to `final`. The values of `mini` and the condition related to it remain unchanged unless further operations modify them.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` is a list containing all previous elements in `final` plus the newly appended `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged except that `elem` is now appended to it. `lst` contains at least one element, and `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**
