Output State: **`final` is a list containing one element [0] that remains sorted in ascending order; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and its current value is greater than or equal to 50.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `final` list now contains one element, which is `0`. The list remains sorted in ascending order since it only contains one element. The value of `c1` remains unchanged and is still `o * 100 // n`, with the condition that it is greater than or equal to 50.
