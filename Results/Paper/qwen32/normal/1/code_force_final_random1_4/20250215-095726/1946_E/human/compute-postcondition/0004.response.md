To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1(b, a)` does. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can infer that `c` and `d` will be assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is greater than 0.
- `a` is less than `b`.

These conditions remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which it does not appear to do since it returns two values.

Thus, the output state will include the new variables `c` and `d` with their values determined by `func_1(b, a)`, while `a` and `b` retain their original values.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is greater than 0, `a` is less than `b`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`**.
