To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is greater than 0.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `a` is not divisible by `b`.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.

The function call `func_1(b, a % b)` suggests that `func_1` might be performing some operation related to `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. However, since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we'll assume that `c` and `d` are simply the results of some computation within `func_1`.

The code snippet returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)`. 

Let's break down the return statement:
- The first element of the tuple is `d`.
- The second element of the tuple is `c - a // b * d`.

Since we do not have the exact implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can express the final output in terms of `c` and `d`.

Output State: **The program returns (d, c - a // b * d)**, where `d` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.
