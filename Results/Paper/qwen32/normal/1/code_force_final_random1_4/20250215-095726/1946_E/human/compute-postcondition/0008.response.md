Given the initial state, `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is greater than 0, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `a` is divisible by `b`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
return 1, -(a // b - 1)
```

Let's determine the output:

- `a // b` computes the integer division of `a` by `b`, which results in a whole number since `a` is divisible by `b`.
- `a // b - 1` subtracts 1 from the result of the integer division.
- The expression `-(a // b - 1)` negates the result of the subtraction.

Thus, the return statement returns a tuple containing two values: `1` and the negated result of `a // b - 1`.

Output State: **The program returns (1, -(a // b - 1))**, where `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`.
