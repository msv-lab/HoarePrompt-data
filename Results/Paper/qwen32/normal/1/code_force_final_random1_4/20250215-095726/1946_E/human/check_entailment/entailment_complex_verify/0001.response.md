### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to count the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy specific conditions regarding their prefix and suffix maximums. The program should output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Key Points:
1. **Prefix Maximums:** These are elements in the permutation that are greater than all preceding elements.
2. **Suffix Maximums:** These are elements in the permutation that are greater than all succeeding elements.
3. **Constraints:** The indices of these maximums are provided, and the program must ensure that the permutation adheres to these indices.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Factorials Calculation:**
   ```python
   facts = [1]
   ch = 1
   for i in range(1, 200002):
       ch *= i
       ch %= 1000000007
       facts.append(ch)
   ```
   This precomputes factorials up to 200001, which is useful for combinatorial calculations.

2. **Main Logic:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (n, m1, m2) = map(int, input().split())
       p = list(map(int, input().split()))
       s = list(map(int, input().split()))
       if p[-1] != s[0] or p[0] != 1 or s[-1] != n:
           print(0)
       else:
           ans = 1
           kol = n
           for x in s:
               cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[n - x] * facts[kol - 1 + x - n])
               ans *= cnk
               ans %= 1000000007
               kol = n - x
           kol = s[0] - 1
           p2 = []
           for i in range(m1 - 2, -1, -1):
               p2.append(p[i])
           for x in p2:
               cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[x - 1] * facts[kol - x])
               ans *= cnk
               ans %= 1000000007
               kol = x - 1
           for i in range(m1 - 1):
               ans *= facts[p[i + 1] - p[i] - 1]
               ans %= 1000000007
           for i in range(m2 - 1):
               ans *= facts[s[i + 1] - s[i] - 1]
               ans %= 1000000007
           print(ans)
   ```
   - **Initial Checks:** The program checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, if the first prefix maximum index is 1, and if the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it outputs 0.
   - **Combinatorial Calculations:** The program calculates combinations using the precomputed factorials and the modular multiplicative inverse functions (`func_1` and `func_2`). It multiplies these combinations to get the final answer.

3. **Functions:**
   - **func_1(a, b):** Computes the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which is used to find the modular multiplicative inverse.
   - **func_2(a, b):** Uses `func_1` to compute \(a \times b^{-1} \mod 1000000007\).

#### Annotations:
The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at key points, confirming the logic of the functions and the flow of the main logic.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints, performs the necessary combinatorial calculations, and uses modular arithmetic to ensure the result fits within the required bounds.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
