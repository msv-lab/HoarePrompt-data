### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to understand if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We are given a permutation of length `n`.
- We know the indices of the prefix maximums (`p`) and suffix maximums (`s`).
- We need to find the number of permutations that match these prefix and suffix maximums.
- The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Constraints**: 
   - The first prefix maximum must be at index 1.
   - The last suffix maximum must be at index `n`.
   - The last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum must be the same.

2. **Combinatorial Approach**:
   - The problem involves calculating combinations and factorials to determine the number of valid permutations.
   - The use of factorials and modular arithmetic suggests that the solution involves combinatorial counting.

#### Solution Analysis:
- **Factorials Calculation**:
  - The program precomputes factorials up to \(2 \times 10^5\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is efficient and necessary for the combinatorial calculations.
  
- **Checking Constraints**:
  - The program checks if the first prefix maximum is at index 1, the last suffix maximum is at index `n`, and the last prefix maximum equals the first suffix maximum. If any of these conditions fail, it outputs `0`.

- **Combination Calculations**:
  - The program calculates combinations using the precomputed factorials and modular inverse (using `func_1` and `func_2`). This is crucial for determining the number of ways to arrange the elements between the known maximums.

- **Iterating Through Prefix and Suffix Maximums**:
  - The program iterates through the suffix maximums and calculates the number of valid permutations for each segment between them.
  - Similarly, it iterates through the prefix maximums in reverse order and calculates the number of valid permutations for each segment between them.

- **Final Calculation**:
  - The program multiplies the results of all combination calculations and outputs the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Verification with Example:
- The provided example test cases are handled correctly by the program, producing the expected outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem based on the given constraints and requirements. It efficiently handles the combinatorial calculations and checks the necessary conditions for valid permutations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
