To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to understand what the program is supposed to do and how it attempts to achieve that. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums, and then outputting the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Functions:**
   - **func_1(a, b):** This function seems to compute the coefficients of the Bezout's identity, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\), there exist integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \gcd(a, b)\). In this context, it appears to be used to find the modular multiplicative inverse.
   - **func_2(a, b):** This function uses the result from `func_1` to compute \(a \times b^{-1} \mod 1000000007\), where \(b^{-1}\) is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(b\) modulo \(1000000007\).

2. **Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to count the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The problem involves combinatorial counting and modular arithmetic.

3. **Analysis of the Provided Code:**
   - The code provided only includes two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) which seem to be related to modular arithmetic operations.
   - There is no logic in the provided code to handle the actual counting of permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.

4. **Missing Components:**
   - The code does not include any logic to parse the input, process the test cases, or calculate the number of permutations based on the given constraints.
   - The core logic for counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums is missing.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the problem requirements and the provided code, the code is incomplete and does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem.
   - Therefore, the provided code cannot be considered correct for the given problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
