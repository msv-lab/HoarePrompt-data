### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not address the problem described. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums, which involves combinatorial logic and careful handling of constraints.

Let's break down the provided functions and their summaries:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function appears to compute the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which are integers `c` and `d` such that `a*c + b*d = gcd(a, b)`.
   - It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is typically used for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of Bézout's identity.

2. **Function `func_2(a, b)`**:
   - This function computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007` using `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.
   - It then multiplies this inverse by `a` and returns the result modulo `1000000007`.

While these functions are useful for modular arithmetic, they do not directly solve the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums. The problem requires a different approach, likely involving dynamic programming or combinatorial mathematics to count the valid permutations.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not address the problem requirements. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are unrelated to the problem of counting permutations with given prefix and suffix maximums.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
