To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and outputs after the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`: Positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
   - `k`: Non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), which has been divided by 2.
   - `l`: List containing integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `k == 0`. If so, it returns the list `l`.
   - If `1 + i > k`, it performs a specific operation and returns the list `l`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `k` and modifies the list `l`.

3. **Operations Inside the Loop**:
   - When `1 + i > k`, the last element `x` of `l` is moved to the position `-k` in the list.
   - Otherwise, the last element `x` of `l` is moved to the front of the list, and `k` is updated to `k - i + 1`.

### Observations from Given Outputs:
- After the first iteration (`i = n-1`), `k` is updated to `k - (n-1) + 1` and the last element `n` is moved to the front.
- After the second iteration (`i = n-2`), `k` is further updated to `k - (n-2) + 1` and the new last element `n-1` is moved to the front.
- After the third iteration (`i = n-3`), `k` is updated again and the new last element `n-2` is moved to the front.

### Final State:
The loop continues until `k == 0` or `1 + i > k`. Given the nature of the loop and the operations performed, the list `l` will be rearranged such that the elements are rotated based on the value of `k`.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations, the list `l` will be a rotated version of the original list `[1, 2, ..., n]` depending on the final value of `k`. Specifically, the list will be rotated such that the first `k` elements are moved to the end of the list.

### Final Output State:
Given the provided information and the behavior of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

- The list `l` will be rotated such that the first `k` elements are moved to the end of the list.
- The value of `k` will be 0 when the loop terminates.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **the list `l` is rotated such that the first `k` elements are moved to the end of the list, and `k` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the list `l` will be rearranged based on the final value of `k`, and `k` will be reduced to 0 by the end of the loop.
