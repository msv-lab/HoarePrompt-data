The given code snippet calls the function `func_5` with the argument `l`. However, there is no information about what `func_5` does, so we cannot determine how `l` or any other variable might be affected. The only thing we know for certain is that `func_5(l)` is executed.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `func_5(l)` has been called.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, and `func_5(l)` has been called.**
