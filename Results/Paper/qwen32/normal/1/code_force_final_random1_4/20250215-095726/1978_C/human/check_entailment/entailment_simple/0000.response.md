### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether it correctly solves the problem of finding a permutation of length \( n \) with a Manhattan value of \( k \). Let's break down the logic and verify each part of the program.

#### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling (`func_4`)**:
   - The function reads the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( k \) is even. If \( k \) is odd, it immediately returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no such permutation exists because the Manhattan value is always even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value \( \text{max\_k} \):
     - If \( n \) is odd, \( \text{max\_k} = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - If \( n \) is even, \( \text{max\_k} = \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If \( k \) exceeds \( \text{max\_k} \), it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no such permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns the pair `(n, k)`.

2. **Finding the Permutation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from \( n \) down to 1 in steps of 2, adjusting the permutation to increase the Manhattan value.
   - If \( k \) becomes zero during this process, it returns the current permutation.
   - If \( k \) is less than the current decrement value, it calls `func_2` to make the final adjustments.
   - It uses `func_3` to swap elements to increase the Manhattan value.

3. **Adjusting the Permutation (`func_2`)**:
   - This function swaps two specific elements in the permutation to achieve the exact Manhattan value \( k \).

4. **Swapping Elements (`func_3`)**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the permutation to adjust the Manhattan value.

5. **Output (`func_5`)**:
   - This function prints "YES" and the resulting permutation if a valid permutation is found.
   - If no valid permutation is found, it prints "NO".

#### Verification:

- The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when \( k \) is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
- The logic for constructing the permutation and adjusting the Manhattan value seems sound based on the problem description.
- The functions `func_2` and `func_3` perform necessary swaps to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

Given the detailed analysis and the logical flow of the program, it appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
