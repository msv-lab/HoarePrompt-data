The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_4()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the exact values returned by `func_4()` are not specified, we can only say that `n` and `k` will take on whatever values `func_4()` returns. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer remains valid if `func_4()` adheres to these constraints.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, as returned by `func_4()`.**
