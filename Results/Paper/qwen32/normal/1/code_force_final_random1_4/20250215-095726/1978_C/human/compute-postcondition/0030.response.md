Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k`, a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value. Depending on certain conditions related to `k` and `n`, the function may return different results. Specifically, it could return a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`, or the result of calling other functions (`func_2` or `func_3`) with specific arguments.**
