The code snippet `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`. Given the initial state, the list `l` starts with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 2 to `n-1`. Therefore, the last element of the list `l` is `2` if `n > 2`, `n` if `n == 2`, and `n-1` if `n == 1`.

Let's consider the different cases:

1. If `n > 2`, the list `l` is `[n-1, n, 2, 3, ..., n-2]`. After popping the last element (`2`), the list becomes `[n-1, n, 2, 3, ..., n-3]`.
2. If `n == 2`, the list `l` is `[1, 2]`. After popping the last element (`2`), the list becomes `[1]`.
3. If `n == 1`, the list `l` is `[0]`. After popping the last element (`0`), the list becomes `[]`.

Other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is `k - i + 1`; `l` is a list starting with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 2 to `n-2` if `n > 2`, `[1]` if `n == 2`, or `[]` if `n == 1`; `i` is `i`; `x` is `n-1`.**
