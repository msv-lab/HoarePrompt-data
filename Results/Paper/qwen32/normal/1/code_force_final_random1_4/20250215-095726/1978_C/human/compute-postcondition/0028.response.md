The given code snippet modifies the variable `l` by assigning it the result of the function call `func_3(c, l)`. None of the other conditions for returning a value are met in the provided code snippet, so no return occurs.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation.
- `k` is `k + 2`.
- `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`.
- `i` is -1.
- `c` is increased by 1.

After executing the line `l = func_3(c, l)`, the new state of `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`. No other variables are modified by this line.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is `k + 2`, `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`, `i` is -1, `c` is increased by 1.**
