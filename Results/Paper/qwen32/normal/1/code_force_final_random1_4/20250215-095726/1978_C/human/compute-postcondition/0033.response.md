To determine the output state, we need to analyze the effect of the line `l.insert(-k, x)` on the list `l` given the initial conditions.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) that is not equal to 0
- `l` is `[n-1, n, 2, 3, ..., n-2]` if `n > 1` or `l` is `[]` if `n == 1`
- `i` is `i` (unchanged)
- `x` is `n-1`

### Impact of the Code:
- The line `l.insert(-k, x)` inserts the value of `x` (which is `n-1`) at the position `-k` in the list `l`.

### Analysis:
- Since `k` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, `-k` will be a negative index, indicating positions from the end of the list.
- If `k` is greater than the length of `l`, the insertion will effectively happen at the beginning of the list because negative indices wrap around.

### Specific Cases:
1. **If `n == 1`:**
   - `l` is initially `[]`.
   - Inserting `n-1` (which is `0`) at any position in an empty list results in `l` being `[0]`.

2. **If `n > 1`:**
   - `l` is initially `[n-1, n, 2, 3, ..., n-2]`.
   - The value `n-1` is inserted at position `-k`. This means:
     - If `-k` is within the bounds of the list, `n-1` is inserted at that position.
     - If `-k` is less than `-len(l)`, `n-1` is inserted at the beginning of the list.

### Output State:
Given the above analysis, the output state can be described as follows:

- If `n == 1`, `l` becomes `[0]`.
- If `n > 1`, `l` has `n-1` inserted at position `-k`.

Since the exact position of insertion depends on the value of `k` relative to the length of `l`, we can describe the output state generally as:

Output State: **if `n == 1`, `l` is `[0]`; if `n > 1`, `l` has `n-1` inserted at position `-k`; `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) that is not equal to 0; `i` is `i`; `x` is `n-1`.**
