The value of `k` is updated to `k - i + 1`. Given that `i` is -1, the new value of `k` becomes `k - (-1) + 1`, which simplifies to `k + 2`.

The values of `n`, `l`, `c`, and the conditions related to `k` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is `k + 2`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `i` is -1, `c` is increased by 1. If `k` equals 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`. If `k < i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`. Otherwise, none of these conditions are met and the program does not return yet.**
