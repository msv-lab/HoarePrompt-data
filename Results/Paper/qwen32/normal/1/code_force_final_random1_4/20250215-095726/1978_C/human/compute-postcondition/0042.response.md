Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `k`, a non-negative integer. It returns a list of integers from 1 to `n` that has been modified based on the value of `k`. Specifically, it rotates the list such that the last element is moved to a position determined by `k`, affecting the order of elements in the list according to the described cases.**
