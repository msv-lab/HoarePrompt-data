Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the initial `k` minus `i` plus 1, `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to 0. If `k` equals 0, the program returns the value of `l`.**
