The code snippet modifies the value of `k` by subtracting `i` and adding 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so effectively, `k` remains unchanged because `k = k - 1 + 1`.

Other conditions and variables (`n`, `l`, the function calls `func_3` and `func_2`, and the return statements) remain as they were described in the initial state since the code only modifies `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the initial `k` (unchanged), `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to 0. If `k` equals 0, the program returns the value of `l`. If `k < i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(2, k, l)`**.
