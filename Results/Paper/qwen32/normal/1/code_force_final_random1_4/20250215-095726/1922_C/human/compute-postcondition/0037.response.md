The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `m`. This means `m` will take on the integer value provided by the user input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d2[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on the loop's logic, `m` is an input integer.**
