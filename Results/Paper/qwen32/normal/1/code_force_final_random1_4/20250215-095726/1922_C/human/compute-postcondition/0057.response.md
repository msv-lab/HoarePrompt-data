The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n` based on user input. This means the original value of `n` is replaced by whatever integer the user inputs.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer greater than 2, and the code changes `n` to the integer value provided by the input, the new value of `n` will be whatever the user provides, assuming it is a valid integer input.

All other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d2[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on the loop's logic, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input.**
