To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`, let's break down the given initial state and the context:

1. **Variables and Initial Values:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This seems to be the number of test cases or iterations, but it doesn't directly affect the current print statement).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, meaning any key not explicitly set will have a default value of 0.
   - `d2`: Another `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, and `d2[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on some loop logic (not detailed here).
   - `m`: Greater than or equal to 1.
   - `x` and `y`: Two integers obtained from the input, with `y` being greater than `x`.

2. **Logic and Calculation:**
   - The specific updates to `d1` and `d2` are not provided, so we can only infer that `d1` is a dictionary that might be populated during some loop or processing steps in the code (which are not shown).
   - Since `d1` is a `defaultdict(int)`, if `x` or `y` do not exist as keys in `d1`, their values will be 0 by default.
   - The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` calculates the difference between the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in `d1`.

3. **Output Explanation:**
   - Given the lack of specific updates to `d1`, the best we can say about the output is that it will be the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.
   - If `d1` has not been modified such that `x` or `y` have non-zero values, the output will simply be `0 - 0 = 0`.

Based on the provided information, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1 is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, and x and y are integers with y > x)**

However, without further details on how `d1` is populated, the simplest and most likely output is:

Output: **0 (assuming d1[x] and d1[y] are not explicitly set to non-zero values)**
