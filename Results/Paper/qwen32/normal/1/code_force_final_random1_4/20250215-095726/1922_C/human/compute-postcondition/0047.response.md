To determine the output of the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an integer greater than 2.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, meaning any key not explicitly set will have a default value of 0.
- `d2` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, and it is updated based on the loop's logic (details of this logic are not provided here).
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x` and `y` are two integers obtained from new input.
- If `y > x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
- `j` is initialized to 1.

### Key Points:
- `d1` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are integers (defaulting to 0 if not set).
- The specific values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` depend on how `d1` is populated in the code (which is not provided), but we know they are integers.
- The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` computes the difference between the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in `d1`.

### Analysis:
- Since the exact values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `d1[y] - d1[x]`.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of the values stored in `d1` for keys `x` and `y`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the difference between the values stored in `d1` for keys `y` and `x`. If `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are not explicitly set, they default to 0.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are the values associated with keys y and x in the defaultdict d1, respectively)**
