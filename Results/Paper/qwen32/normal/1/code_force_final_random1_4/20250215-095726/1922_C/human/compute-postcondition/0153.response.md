To determine the output of the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the computation involved:

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. For keys `k` ranging from 3 to `n`, `d1[k]` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`.
   - `d2`: Another `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. For keys `i` ranging from 1 to `n-1`, `d2[i]` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` within a loop.
   - `m`: An integer greater than 0 obtained from the input.
   - `j`: Set to the value of `m`.
   - `x` and `y`: A pair of integers obtained from the input, with `y > x`.

2. **Computation Details:**
   - The `d1` dictionary is populated such that `d1[k]` represents the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive elements of `l` up to the `k`-th position.
   - The `d2` dictionary is populated similarly but for a different purpose (not directly relevant to this specific print statement).

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement computes `d1[y] - d1[x]`.
   - `d1[y]` is the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive elements of `l` up to the `y`-th position.
   - `d1[x]` is the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive elements of `l` up to the `x`-th position.
   - Therefore, `d1[y] - d1[x]` gives the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `l` from the `x+1`-th position to the `y`-th position.

Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement is the sum of differences between consecutive elements of the list `l` starting from the `x+1`-th element up to the `y`-th element.

Output: **the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `l` from the `x+1`-th position to the `y`-th position**
