The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer**.
