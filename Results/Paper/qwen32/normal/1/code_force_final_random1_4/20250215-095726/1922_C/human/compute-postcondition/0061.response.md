Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer obtained from the input, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains {2: 1}, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory (and is now empty), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input.**

Natural Language: The only change is that `d1` now contains the key-value pair `{2: 1}`. All other variables remain unchanged.
