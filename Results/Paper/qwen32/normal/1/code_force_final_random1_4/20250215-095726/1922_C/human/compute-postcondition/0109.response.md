To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`, let's break down the given initial state and understand the values involved:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i`: Set to 1.
   - `n`: Greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A defaultdict with integer keys from 2 to `n` and values computed based on differences between consecutive elements in `l`.
   - `d2`: A defaultdict with integer keys from 1 to `n-1` and values computed based on differences between consecutive elements in `l`.
   - `m`: Greater than 0.
   - `j`: Equal to `m-1`.
   - `x` and `y`: New pair of integers obtained from the input, with `y > x` or `y ≤ x`.

2. **Defaultdicts (`d1` and `d2`):**
   - `d1` contains keys from 2 to `n` where each key `k` maps to the difference between `l[k-1]` and `l[k-2]`.
   - `d2` contains keys from 1 to `n-1` where each key `k` maps to the difference between `l[k]` and `l[k-1]`.

3. **The Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` will output the difference between the values stored in `d2` at keys `y` and `x`.

Given that `d2` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values representing differences between consecutive elements in `l`, the output of `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be the difference between the differences of consecutive elements at positions `y` and `x` in the list `l`.

### Explanation of the Output:
- `d2[y]` represents the difference between `l[y]` and `l[y-1]`.
- `d2[x]` represents the difference between `l[x]` and `l[x-1]`.
- Therefore, `d2[y] - d2[x]` computes the difference between these two differences.

Since the exact values of `l`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `d2[y] - d2[x]`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] is the difference between l[y] and l[y-1], and d2[x] is the difference between l[x] and l[x-1])**
