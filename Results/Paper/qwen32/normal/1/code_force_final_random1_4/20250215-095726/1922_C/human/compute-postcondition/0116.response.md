The given Python code snippet initializes `d2` as a new `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input from the user, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a new defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input, and if `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**
