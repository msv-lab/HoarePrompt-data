To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and implicitly the iteration over the range.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4,
- `i` is 2,
- `n` is greater than 2,
- `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input,
- `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains either {2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3} if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, or {2: 1, 3: `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, 4: `l[2] - l[1] + 2`} otherwise, or {2: 1, 3: `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, 4: `l[3] - l[1] + 1`},
- `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory (and is now empty),
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1,
- `j` is equal to `m-1`,
- `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input.

Since the loop iterates over `i` in the range `(1, n - 1)`, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is 3 (since it was 2 at the end of the previous iteration and is incremented by 1),
- All other variables remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains either {2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3} if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, or {2: 1, 3: `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, 4: `l[2] - l[1] + 2`} otherwise, or {2: 1, 3: `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, 4: `l[3] - l[1] + 1`}, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory (and is now empty), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input.**
