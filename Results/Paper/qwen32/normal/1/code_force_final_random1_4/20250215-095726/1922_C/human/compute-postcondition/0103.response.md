To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not directly used in the print statement).
- `i`: Initialized to 1 (not directly used in the print statement).
- `n`: Greater than 2 (the length of list `l`).
- `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1`: A `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, containing keys from 2 to `n`. The values are computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`.
- `d2`: A `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, containing keys from 1 to `n-1`. The values are computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` (not directly used in the print statement).
- `m`: Greater than 0 (not directly used in the print statement).
- `j`: Initialized to `m` (not directly used in the print statement).
- `x` and `y`: New pair of integers obtained from the input. If `y > x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Computation of `d1`:
The `d1` dictionary is constructed with keys from 2 to `n`, where each key `k` has a value computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`. Specifically, the value for `d1[k]` is the difference between `l[k-1]` and `l[k-2]`.

### The Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`. This means it will output the difference between the values stored in `d1` at keys `y` and `x`.

### Explanation:
- `d1[y]` represents the difference between `l[y-1]` and `l[y-2]`.
- `d1[x]` represents the difference between `l[x-1]` and `l[x-2]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the difference between these two differences:
\[ \text{Output} = (l[y-1] - l[y-2]) - (l[x-1] - l[x-2]) \]

### Final Output:
Output: **(l[y-1] - l[y-2]) - (l[x-1] - l[x-2])**
