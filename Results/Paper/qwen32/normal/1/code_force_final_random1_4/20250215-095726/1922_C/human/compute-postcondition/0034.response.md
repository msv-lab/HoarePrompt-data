The code snippet updates the value of `d2[i]` based on the expression `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. This means that the value of `d2[i]` is recalculated using the current values of `l[i]`, `l[i - 1]`, and `d2[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the updated value of `d2[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 4`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, and `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**
