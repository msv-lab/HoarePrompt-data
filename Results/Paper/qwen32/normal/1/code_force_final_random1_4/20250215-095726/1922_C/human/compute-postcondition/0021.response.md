The code snippet assigns the value `1` to `d2[n - 1]`. This means that the key `n - 1` in the dictionary `d2` will now have the value `1`.

All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `d1`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d1[k]` for `k` from 2 to `n` is updated based on the loop's logic, and `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d2[n - 1]` is 1.**
