The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the element at index `i` of the list `l` to the variable `score`. Given the initial state, `i` is incremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `l` is a sorted list of integers.

Since `i` is incremented by 2 each time, `i` will always point to an even index in the list `l` (considering 0-based indexing). The value of `score` will be updated by adding the element at the current even index `i` of the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is incremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `score` is updated by adding `l[i]` to its previous value.**
