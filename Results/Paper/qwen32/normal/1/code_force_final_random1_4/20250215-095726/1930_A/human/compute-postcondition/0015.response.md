The code snippet sets the variable `score` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `score`, which was the sum of elements at even indices of the original list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the length of the new input list, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is 0.**
