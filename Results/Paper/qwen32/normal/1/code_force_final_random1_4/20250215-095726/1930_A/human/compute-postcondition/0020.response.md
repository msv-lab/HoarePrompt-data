To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over a range starting from 0 up to (but not including) `2 * n`, with a step of 2.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 2, and `score` was updated by adding `l[i]` to its previous value.

Let's break it down:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the new input.
   - `i` is incremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `score` is updated by adding `l[i]` to its previous value.

2. **Adjustments Needed for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, the new value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 2.
   - The variable `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

Given that `i` was incremented by 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration would be `i + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` should be `i + 2`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Since the problem does not provide the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we'll express the state in terms of the updated `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i + 2`, `score` is updated by adding `l[i]` to its previous value.**

However, since we need to specify the exact state without making assumptions about the current value of `i`, we'll just indicate the increment:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is incremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
