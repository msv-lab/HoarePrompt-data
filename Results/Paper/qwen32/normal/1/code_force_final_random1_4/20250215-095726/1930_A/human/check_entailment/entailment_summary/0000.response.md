### Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to maximize the score by always choosing pairs of integers such that the minimum of the pair contributes to the score. The optimal strategy involves sorting the list of integers and then summing up the smallest numbers in each pair. By sorting the list, the smallest numbers will naturally occupy the even indices when we iterate through the list in steps of 2. This ensures that we are always adding the smaller number of each pair to the score, thereby maximizing the score.

Let's break down the provided program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Score Calculation**: The program iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element starting from index 0 (i.e., the even indices), and adds these elements to the score.
4. **Output**: The score for each test case is printed.

This approach aligns perfectly with the optimal strategy described above. By sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the minimum of each pair is added to the score, thus achieving the maximum possible score.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided execution summary and the reasoning above, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
