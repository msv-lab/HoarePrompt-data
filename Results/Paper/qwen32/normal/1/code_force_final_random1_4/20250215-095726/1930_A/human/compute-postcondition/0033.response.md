The code snippet `score += l[i]` increments the variable `score` by the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l`. Given that `i` is `i + 4` before this operation, we assume `i` was previously calculated or set to some value, and now it is being used to access an element in the list `l`.

Since the exact value of `i` before the increment is not specified, we'll denote it as `i_initial`. After the operation, `i` remains `i_initial + 4`, and `score` is updated to its previous value plus `l[i_initial + 4]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and the sorted list `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `i + 4`, `score` is updated to `score + l[i]`.**
