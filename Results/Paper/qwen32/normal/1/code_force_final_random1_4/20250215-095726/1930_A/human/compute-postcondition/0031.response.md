The code snippet `score += l[i]` increments the variable `score` by the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the input
- `i` is `i + 2`

After executing the code, `score` will be updated by adding the value of `l[i]` to its current value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged except for `score`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `i + 2`, `score` is `score + l[i]`**.
