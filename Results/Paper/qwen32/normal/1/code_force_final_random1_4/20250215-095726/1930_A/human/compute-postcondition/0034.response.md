To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and accumulates the `score`. The loop iterates over the list `l` with a step of 2, adding every second element (starting from index 0) to `score`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    score += l[i]
```
- The loop starts at index `0` and increments `i` by `2` in each iteration.
- It continues until `i` reaches `2 * n`.
- In each iteration, it adds the element at index `i` of the list `l` to `score`.

Since the loop increments `i` by `2` each time, the total number of iterations is `n`. This means the loop will execute exactly `n` times.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the number of iterations.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.
- `score` is the sum of elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(n-1)) of the list `l`.

Thus, after all iterations, the `score` will be the sum of the elements at indices `0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(n-1)` of the sorted list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the integer value from the input, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(n-1) of the list `l`.**

In simpler terms, the final `score` is the sum of every second element in the sorted list `l`, starting from the first element.
