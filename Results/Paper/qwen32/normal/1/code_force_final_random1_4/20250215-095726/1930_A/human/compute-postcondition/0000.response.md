In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on adjusting the state related to `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will iterate `int(input())` times.
2. **Dependency on Input**: The number of iterations is determined by the integer input, which should match the value of `t`.
3. **Adjusting State**: To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be set to a positive integer (since the problem specifies `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`). The input function should return this value.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted such that the input function returns `t`, ensuring the loop runs `t` times.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and the input function returns `t`**.

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times as intended.
