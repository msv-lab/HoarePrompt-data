### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The strategy to maximize the score involves pairing the smallest available numbers together because adding the smaller number of each pair to the score will yield the highest possible total score.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which indicates that there are `2n` integers on the whiteboard. It then reads these `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we iterate through the list, we are always considering the smallest available numbers first.

3. **Scoring Calculation**: The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2. By doing so, it effectively pairs up the smallest numbers (`l[0]` with `l[1]`, `l[2]` with `l[3]`, etc.). Since the list is sorted, `l[i]` will always be the smaller number in each pair `(l[i], l[i+1])`. Therefore, adding `l[i]` to the score in each iteration is equivalent to adding the minimum of each pair to the score.

4. **Output**: After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the total score.

This approach ensures that we are always maximizing the score by summing up the smallest possible values from each pair, which aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem. It sorts the list of integers and sums up the smallest numbers from each pair, ensuring the maximum possible score.

**Correctness: True**
