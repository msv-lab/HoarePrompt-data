### Reasoning:
The problem requires maximizing the score by always picking pairs of integers and adding the smaller of the two to the score. To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to pair the smallest available integers together. This ensures that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible.

Here's how the program works:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the integer `n`, which determines the number of pairs (2n integers).
   - It reads the list of 2n integers and sorts them.
   - It initializes the score to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (i.e., elements at even indices), and adds these to the score.
   - Finally, it prints the score for that test case.

Since the list is sorted, the elements at even indices are indeed the smaller values in each pair when the list is considered in pairs. Therefore, this approach correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
