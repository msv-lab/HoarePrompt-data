### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the smaller of the two to the score. To achieve the maximum score, we should always pair the smallest available numbers together. This is because choosing the smallest numbers ensures that we are maximizing the contribution of the smaller values to the score.

The provided program follows this strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers.
4. It calculates the score by summing up the elements at even indices of the sorted list. Since the list is sorted, the elements at even indices are the smallest available numbers when pairing them sequentially.

By summing the elements at even indices of the sorted list, the program effectively pairs the smallest numbers together, which maximizes the score as per the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
