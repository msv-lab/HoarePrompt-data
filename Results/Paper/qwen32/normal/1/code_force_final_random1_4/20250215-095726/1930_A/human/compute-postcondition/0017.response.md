The code snippet `score += l[i]` increments the `score` variable by the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l`. Given the initial state, `score` starts at 0 and `l` is a sorted list of integers.

Since `i` is not defined in the given initial state, we assume `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `l`. The exact value added to `score` depends on the value of `l[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is the previous `score` plus `l[i]`.**
