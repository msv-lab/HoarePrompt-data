The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, sorts these integers into a list, and assigns this sorted list to the variable `l`. The variable `n` is mentioned as the integer value from the input, but it is not used in the provided code snippet. The variable `score` is mentioned as the sum of elements at even indices in `l`, but it is also not updated or recalculated in the provided code snippet.

Given the initial state and the provided code, the only variable that changes is `l`, which now holds the sorted list of integers derived from the input. The variables `t` and `score` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the integer value from the input, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is the sum of elements at even indices in `l` (unchanged)**
