The code assigns the value of `min(a, b) + m` to the variable `mn`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are read from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1, but `i` is not used in the given code snippet. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`.**
