The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state only specifies the range of `t`, which is not affected by the code snippet provided. 

Therefore, the Output State includes the new variables `a`, `b`, and `m` each holding integer values obtained from the input, while `t` retains its original state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input.**
