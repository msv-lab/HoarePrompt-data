### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program against the problem statement.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have two installations that launch fireworks at intervals `a` and `b` respectively.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For any given time `t`, the number of fireworks launched by the first installation up to time `t` is `floor(t / a)`.
   - Similarly, the number of fireworks launched by the second installation up to time `t` is `floor(t / b)`.
   - The time `t` we are interested in is `min(a, b) + m` because this is the earliest point where fireworks from both installations could overlap in their visibility period.

3. **Logic in the Program**:
   - The program calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m`.
   - It then checks if `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b` and if neither `a` nor `b` is `1`. If this condition is true, it adds `1` to the sum of `mn // a` and `mn // b`.
   - Otherwise, it just prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The condition `m % a == 0 and m % b == 0` ensures that there is a perfect overlap at `m` minutes for both installations, adding an extra count.
   - However, the additional condition `a != 1 and b != 1` seems unnecessary and incorrect. Even if `a` or `b` is `1`, the logic should still hold as long as `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`.
   - For example, if `a = 1` and `b = 2`, and `m = 2`, the condition `m % a == 0 and m % b == 0` is true, but the program would incorrectly skip adding `1` because `a == 1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when `a` or `b` is `1`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
