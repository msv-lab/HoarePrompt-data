To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This indicates the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly affect the calculation in the provided code snippet.
- `i` is incremented by 1. This suggests there might be a loop, but it doesn't affect the current calculation either.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `mn` is defined as `min(a, b) + m`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(mn // a + mn // b)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `mn`:**
   - `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`. This means `mn` is the smaller of `a` and `b` plus `m`.

2. **Calculate `mn // a`:**
   - This is the integer division of `mn` by `a`. It represents how many times `a` fits into `mn` without exceeding it.

3. **Calculate `mn // b`:**
   - This is the integer division of `mn` by `b`. It represents how many times `b` fits into `mn` without exceeding it.

4. **Sum the Results:**
   - The final result to be printed is the sum of `mn // a` and `mn // b`.

### Final Output Description:
Given the above calculations, the output will be the sum of how many times `a` and `b` fit into `mn` (which is `min(a, b) + m`).

Output: **(min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b (where a, b, and m are integers read from the input)**
