The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then computes and prints a value based on these inputs. Specifically, it calculates `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.
