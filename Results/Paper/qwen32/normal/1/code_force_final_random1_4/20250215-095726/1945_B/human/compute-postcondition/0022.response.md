To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each set of inputs and accumulates results based on the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each iteration `i` (from 0 to `t-1`), it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.
- It calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`.
- It checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1.
  - If true, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` sets of inputs and printed the corresponding results. The state of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `mn` will change with each iteration, but the overall output will be a series of printed values based on the conditions mentioned above.

Since the problem asks for the final output state in terms of the variables involved in the loop, we can summarize the final state as follows:

- `t` will remain the same as the initial input value representing the number of test cases.
- `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop finishes, indicating that all iterations have been completed.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` will hold the values from the last iteration.
- `mn` will be `min(a, b) + m` from the last iteration.

However, the primary focus is on the printed outputs, which are the results of each iteration.

### Final Output State Description:
The final output state is a series of printed values, one for each iteration of the loop. Each printed value is determined by the formula `mn // a + mn // b + 1` if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1; otherwise, it is `mn // a + mn // b`.

Given the format requirement, we can state the final output state as:

Output State: **A series of printed values, each determined by the formula `mn // a + mn // b + 1` if `m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1`; otherwise, `mn // a + mn // b`, where `mn = min(a, b) + m` for each set of `a`, `b`, and `m` read from the input.**
