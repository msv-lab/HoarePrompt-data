Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is flawed. The formula `mn // a + mn // b` does not account for overlapping intervals where fireworks from both installations are visible at the same time.
   
2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The special conditions like `m % a == 0` and `m % b == 0` do not accurately handle all edge cases, especially when `a` and `b` are not factors of `m`.

3. **Lack of Consideration for Overlaps**: The program does not consider the overlap between the visibility intervals of fireworks from both installations. This is crucial because fireworks from different installations can be visible at the same time if their intervals overlap.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, and then calculate how many fireworks from each installation are visible within a certain period that includes overlaps.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return abs(x * y) // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        max_visible = (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm_ab)
        # Check for additional fireworks visible at the boundary
        if m % a == 0:
            max_visible += 1
        if m % b == 0:
            max_visible += 1
        # Ensure we don't double-count the boundary if both conditions are true
        if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0:
            max_visible -= 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the LCM of `a` and `b` to handle overlaps correctly and ensures that fireworks visible at the boundary are counted appropriately.
