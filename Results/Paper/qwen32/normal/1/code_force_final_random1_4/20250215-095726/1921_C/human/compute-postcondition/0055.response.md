The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components based on spaces, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. This means that `arr` is now updated to contain the new list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
