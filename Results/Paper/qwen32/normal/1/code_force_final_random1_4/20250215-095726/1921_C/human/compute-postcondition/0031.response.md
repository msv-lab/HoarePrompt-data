The given code snippet reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `arr`. This means the previous value of `arr` is replaced with the newly read list. The other variables (`test_cases`, `t`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `array2`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `array2` is a list containing `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
