Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`test_cases`**: Remains unchanged (not used in the print statement).
2. **`t`**: Remains unchanged (not used in the print statement).
3. **`feat`**: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `n = feat[0]`: The first element of `feat`.
   - `f = feat[1]`: The second element of `feat`.
   - `a = feat[2]`: The third element of `feat`.
   - `b = feat[-1]`: The last element of `feat`.
4. **`arr`**: A new list of integers obtained from the input.
5. **`i`**: Set to `n - 1`.
6. **`array2`**: Contains elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.
7. **Condition**: The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. The condition mentioned in the initial state does not affect the content of the print statement itself. It only determines whether this print statement will execute or not, but since the problem specifies the print statement, we assume it will execute under the given conditions.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
