To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the `array2` based on the conditions specified.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. During each iteration, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`. If the condition is met, it appends the product of this difference and `a` to `array2`.

Given the initial state and the progression described for the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue this process until `i` reaches `n-1`.

**Output State:** After the loop completes all its iterations, `test_cases`, `t`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged as per the problem statement. The only variable that changes is `array2`, which accumulates the products `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, and `array2` includes all values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.**

In simpler terms, `array2` contains all the calculated values from the loop's condition being satisfied across all iterations, while all other variables retain their initial values.
