To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and `n` remains constant.

From the loop statement:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Since `n` does not change during the iterations, it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment in `i`.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same.**

To be more specific, if `i` was 1 at the end of the first iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the second iteration, and so on.

Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged.**

For clarity, let's assume `i` was 1 at the end of the first iteration, then the state at the start of the second iteration would be:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged.**

Generalizing this, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged.**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged.**
