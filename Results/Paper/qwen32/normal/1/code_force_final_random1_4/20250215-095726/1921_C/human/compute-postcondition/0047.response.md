Given the initial state described, the key point to focus on is the `print('No')` statement. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `test_cases`, `t`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, or `array2`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print('No')` statement is a direct output of the string `'No'`.
- None of the variables mentioned in the initial state affect this particular print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not require any additional calculations or descriptions of variable values.

Output: **No**
