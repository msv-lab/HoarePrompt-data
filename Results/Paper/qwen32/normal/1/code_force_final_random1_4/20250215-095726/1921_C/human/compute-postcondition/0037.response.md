To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`, so the only variable we can adjust is `i`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, let's call it `i_prev`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Increment**: In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given this, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `i` was previously `i_prev` (which was the value it had at the end of the last iteration), and it gets incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, we simply need to increase `i` by 1.

No other variables in the loop head (`n`) need to be adjusted because they remain constant throughout the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `array2` includes the newly appended value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. Given that the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, if the previous value of `i` was `k`, then the next value of `i` should be `k + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration, generalizing `i`:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `array2` includes the newly appended value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**

But to be precise in terms of the next specific value:

If `i` was 1 at the end of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` should be 2. So, generally if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

So, if we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `i` should be `k + 1`. For the first iteration, `i` starts from 1, so if the last value of `i` was 1, the next value should be 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, assuming `i` was 1 at the end of the first iteration:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `array2` includes the newly appended value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged, `i` is 2**.

For the general case where `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `array2` includes the newly appended value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**

Given the first iteration context, the specific state would be:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `array2` includes the newly appended value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged, `i` is 2**
