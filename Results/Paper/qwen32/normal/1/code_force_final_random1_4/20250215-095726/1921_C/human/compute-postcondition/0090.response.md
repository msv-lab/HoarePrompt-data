Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `array2` is a list that may contain one element depending on the conditions. If `i` is 0 and the first element of `arr` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains one element which is `[arr[0] * a]`. If `i` is not 0 and `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.**
