The code snippet assigns a new list to the variable `feat`. This list is created by taking the input from the user, splitting it by spaces, and converting each split string into an integer.

Given that `feat` is being reassigned, its previous value is no longer relevant for the output state. All other variables remain unchanged except for `feat` and `i`.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` remains unchanged, `f` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
