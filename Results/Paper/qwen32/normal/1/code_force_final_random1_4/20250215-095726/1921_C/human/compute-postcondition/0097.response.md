The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `i` is 2.**
