The given code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which are then assigned to the variable `feat`. This means that `feat` will now hold the integers from the input line.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `feat`, which is populated with the integers from the input. All other variables (`test_cases`, `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m_i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ `f`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9; the second line contains `n` integers `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` such that 1 ≤ `m_i` ≤ 10^9 and `m_i` < `m_{i+1}`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `feat` is a list of integers read from the input.**
