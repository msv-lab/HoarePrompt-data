Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific moments (`m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`). He starts with `f` units of charge, and his phone consumes `a` units of charge per unit of time. Additionally, turning the phone off and then on consumes `b` units of charge. The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of battery.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list of message times and calculating the charge consumed between messages. If the time difference between two consecutive messages is less than `b/a`, it assumes the phone stays on during that period and calculates the charge consumed accordingly. Otherwise, it considers turning the phone off and on, which consumes `b` units of charge.

However, the solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Charge Calculation**: The solution incorrectly calculates the charge consumed between messages. It should consider both scenarios (staying on or turning off and on) for every pair of consecutive messages and choose the one that minimizes the total charge consumed.
   
2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the phone needs to be turned off and on multiple times between messages or when the initial charge is insufficient even to send the first message.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic in the solution is flawed because it only considers the charge consumed between messages where the time difference is less than `b/a`. It does not account for the fact that even if the time difference is greater than `b/a`, it might still be more efficient to turn the phone off and on to save charge.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through the list of message times and decide whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on for each pair of consecutive messages. We should compare the charge consumed in both scenarios and choose the one that minimizes the total charge consumed.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initial charge
        current_charge = f
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                # Time from 0 to first message
                time_diff = arr[i]
            else:
                # Time between consecutive messages
                time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            
            # Cost if we keep the phone on
            cost_on = time_diff * a
            
            # Cost if we turn off and on the phone
            cost_off_on = b
            
            # Choose the cheaper option
            if cost_on <= cost_off_on:
                current_charge -= cost_on
            else:
                current_charge -= cost_off_on
            
            # Check if we have enough charge to send the message
            if current_charge <= 0:
                print("NO")
                break
        else:
            print("YES")

func()
```
