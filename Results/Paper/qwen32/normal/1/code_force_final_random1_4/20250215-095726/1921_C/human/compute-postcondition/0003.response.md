The code assigns the value of the first element of the list `feat` to the variable `n`. The values of `test_cases`, `t`, and the elements of `feat` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `feat` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is the first element of `feat`.**
