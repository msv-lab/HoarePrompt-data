The code appends a new value to the list `array2`. This new value is calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, where `i` is initially 3. After the operation, `i` remains unchanged, and the other variables retain their previous values unless explicitly modified.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `feat` is a list of integers read from the input
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is the last element of `feat`
- `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input
- `array2` includes the newly appended value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a` if `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.
- `i` is 3

After executing the line `array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)`, the new value `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a` is appended to `array2`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `array2` includes the newly appended value `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`, `i` is 3.**
