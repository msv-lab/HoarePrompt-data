Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is not equal to 0. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the single element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.**
