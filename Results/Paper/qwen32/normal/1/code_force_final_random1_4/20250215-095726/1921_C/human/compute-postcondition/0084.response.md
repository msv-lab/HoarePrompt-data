The code appends the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` to `array2`. Since `array2` was initially empty, it now contains one element, which is `arr[0] * a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input where the first element of `arr` is less than `b / a`, `array2` is a list containing one element `[arr[0] * a]`, and the current value of `i` is 0**.
