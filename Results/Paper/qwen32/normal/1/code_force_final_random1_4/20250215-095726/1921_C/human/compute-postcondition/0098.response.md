The given code snippet appends the product of `arr[0]` and `a` to the list `array2`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `arr[0]` and `a`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for the appended element. However, we can express the new state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is 2, and `array2` has a new element `arr[0] * a` appended to it.**
