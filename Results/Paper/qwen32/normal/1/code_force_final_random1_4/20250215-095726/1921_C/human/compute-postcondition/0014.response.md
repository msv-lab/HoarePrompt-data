The code appends a calculated value to the `array2` list. The value being appended is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given the initial state, the variables `test_cases`, `t`, `feat`, `arr`, and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed, so `i` refers to the current index in `arr` that is one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `array2` has a new element appended which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**
