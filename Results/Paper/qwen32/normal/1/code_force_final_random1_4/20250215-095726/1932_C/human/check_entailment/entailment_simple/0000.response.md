### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a` of `n` integers, and the string `s` of `n` commands.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of `a` in the order specified by the commands.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of `a` respectively.
   - For each command in `s`, it appends the appropriate element (`a[l]` for 'L' and `a[r]` for 'R') to `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.

3. **Calculating Remainders:**
   - After constructing `b`, the program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders.
   - It calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and computes the remainder when this product is divided by `m`.
   - The cumulative product `p` is updated iteratively, and the remainder is appended to `ans`.

4. **Returning Results:**
   - Finally, the function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which corresponds to the correct sequence of remainders as per the problem statement.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Cumulative Product:**
  - The program calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, but it should calculate the cumulative product of the elements in the original order of removal as specified by `s`.
  - By reversing `b` and calculating the product, the program incorrectly computes the remainders for the elements that would be removed in the reverse order of the commands.

### Correct Approach:
- Instead of reversing `b` and calculating the product, the program should calculate the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in the original order and then reverse the result before returning it.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program, the current implementation is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
