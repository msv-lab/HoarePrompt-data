The code appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to the list `b`. Given that `r` is initially `n - 1`, the last element of `a` is appended to `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`. Additionally, `s[i]` is not 'L'**
