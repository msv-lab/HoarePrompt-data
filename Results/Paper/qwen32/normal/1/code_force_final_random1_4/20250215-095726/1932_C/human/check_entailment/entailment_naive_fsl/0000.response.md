Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the described functionality. Specifically, the program incorrectly constructs the list `b` which is supposed to store the elements of the array `a` in the order they are removed according to the commands. However, the program appends the elements to `b` without actually removing them from `a`, and it calculates the product of elements in reverse order of their removal.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. The program creates a list `b` to store the elements as they are removed, but it doesn't actually remove these elements from the original array `a`. This means the product calculation is incorrect because it always uses the original array `a`.

2. The program calculates the product of elements in reverse order of their removal, which is not what the problem statement requires. The problem statement specifies that the product should be calculated before each element is removed.

3. The final result is reversed before being returned, which is unnecessary and incorrect since the product calculations are already done in the wrong order.

To fix the program, we need to calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` before each removal operation and update the array accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    result = []
    
    # Calculate the initial product of all elements modulo m
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    # Process each command
    for command in s:
        result.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[0], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[-1], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
            a.pop()
    
    print(*result)
```

This corrected version properly calculates the product of the remaining elements before each removal and updates the array accordingly. It also handles the modular arithmetic correctly using Fermat's Little Theorem to compute the modular inverse for division under modulo `m`.
