The code snippet assigns the value `n - 1` to the variable `r`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is an empty list; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**
