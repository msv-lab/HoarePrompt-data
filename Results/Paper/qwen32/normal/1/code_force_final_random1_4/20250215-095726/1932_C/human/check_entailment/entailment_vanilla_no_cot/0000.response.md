Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the product of the elements of the array `a` based on the commands given. Here's why:

1. The program creates a list `b` which stores the elements that would be removed according to the commands, but it does not compute the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` at each step.
2. Instead of computing the product of the current state of the array `a` at each step, it computes the product of the elements stored in `b` in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.

To fix this, the program should compute the product of the current state of the array `a` at each step and then remove the appropriate element based on the command. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    result = []
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    left_index = 0
    right_index = n - 1
    for command in s:
        result.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[left_index], m-2, m)) % m  # modular multiplicative inverse
            left_index += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[right_index], m-2, m)) % m  # modular multiplicative inverse
            right_index -= 1
    print(*result)
```

In this corrected version:
- We initialize `product` with the product of all elements in `a`.
- For each command, we append the current `product` to the result list.
- We then update the `product` by removing the element that was just "processed" (either from the left or right) using the modular multiplicative inverse to avoid division in modular arithmetic. This is necessary because direct division is not defined in modular arithmetic.
