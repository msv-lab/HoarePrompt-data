The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial conditions:

- If `s[3]` is 'L', `r` is initially `n-1`.
- If `s[3]` is 'R', `r` is initially `n-2`.

After executing `r -= 1`:

- If `s[3]` is 'L', `r` becomes `(n-1) - 1` which is `n-2`.
- If `s[3]` is 'R', `r` becomes `(n-2) - 1` which is `n-3`.

The values of `s[3]`, `b`, `l`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **If `s[3]` is 'L', `b` is `[a[0], a[1], a[n-1]]`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n-2`; if `s[3] is 'R', `b` is `[a[n-1], a[n-2], a[n-2]]`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n-3`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
