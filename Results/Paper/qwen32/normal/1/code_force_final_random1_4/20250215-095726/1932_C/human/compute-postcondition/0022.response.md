Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `i` is 4. If `s[3]` is 'L', then if `s[4]` is 'L', `b` is `[a[0], a[1], a[2]]`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1`; otherwise, `b` is `[a[0], a[1], a[n-1]]`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n-2`. If `s[3]` is 'R', then if `s[4]` is 'L', `b` is `[a[0], a[n-1], a[1]]`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 2`; otherwise, `b` is `[a[n-1], a[n-2], a[n-2]]`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n-3`.**
