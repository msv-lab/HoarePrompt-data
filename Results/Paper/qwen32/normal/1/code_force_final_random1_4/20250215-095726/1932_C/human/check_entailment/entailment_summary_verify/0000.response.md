Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The provided program consists of a main loop that processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the input values, calls `func_1`, and prints the result.

#### Function `func_1` Breakdown

1. **Initialization:**
   - `b = []`: An empty list to store elements as they are "removed" based on commands.
   - `l = 0` and `r = n - 1`: Pointers to the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.

2. **Building List `b`:**
   - For each command in the string `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', append the leftmost element (`a[l]`) to `b` and increment `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', append the rightmost element (`a[r]`) to `b` and decrement `r`.
   - This loop builds `b` by selecting elements in the order they would be removed, but it does not modify the original array `a`.

3. **Calculating Cumulative Product:**
   - Initialize `p = 1` to hold the cumulative product.
   - Iterate over the elements in `b` in reverse order.
   - For each element `v` in `b` (in reverse), update `p` with `(p * v) % m` and append `p` to `ans`.
   - Finally, return `reversed(ans)`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order, which is incorrect. The problem requires calculating the product of the remaining elements in `a` before each removal.
   
2. **Incorrect Array Modification:**
   - The program does not actually modify the array `a` during the process. It only constructs `b` based on the commands.

3. **Unnecessary Reversal:**
   - The final result is reversed before being returned, which is unnecessary and incorrect due to the previous issues.

### Correct Approach

The correct approach involves:
- Calculating the product of all elements in `a` initially.
- Iteratively updating the product by removing elements as specified by the commands.
- Using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure correctness.

### Verification Against Function Summary

The function summary describes the process of constructing `b` and then calculating the cumulative product in reverse order. However, this does not align with the problem requirements, which specify calculating the product before each removal.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not correctly implement the described functionality. It incorrectly constructs the list `b` and calculates the product in the wrong order.

**Final: False**
