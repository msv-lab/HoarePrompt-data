The only variable in the loop head is `v`, which iterates over the reversed list `b`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in the reversed list `b`.

Given:
- `b` contains at least one element.
- `l` is `n`.
- `r` is `-1`.
- `ans` is a list containing `[p, p]`.
- `p` is `((v % m) * v) % m`.
- `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was the current element from the reversed list `b`. For the next iteration, `v` should be the previous element in the reversed list `b`.

Since `b` contains at least one element and we are iterating in reverse, the state at the start of the next iteration would involve `v` taking the value of the next element in the reversed list `b`.

State: **`b` contains at least one element, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing `[p, p]`, `p` is `((v % m) * v) % m`, `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`**.

However, to be more specific about the change in `v`, let's denote the current `v` as `v_current` and the next `v` in the reversed list as `v_next`.

State: **`b` contains at least one element, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing `[p, p]`, `p` is `((v_next % m) * v_next) % m`, `v` is `v_next`**.
