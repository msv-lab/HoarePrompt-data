The code concatenates the string `'a'` with the character from the `alphabet` string at the index `n - 28` and then appends `'z'` to form the new value of `word`. Given that `n` is between 27 and 52, `n - 28` will be between `-1` and `23`. However, since Python's string indexing allows negative indices to wrap around, `alphabet[-1]` refers to the last character `'z'`, `alphabet[-2]` refers to the second last character `'y'`, and so on.

Since `n` is greater than 26, `n - 28` will be a valid index into the `alphabet` string (ranging from -1 to 23), effectively giving us characters from `'z'` to `'d'`.

For example:
- If `n` is 27, `n - 28` is `-1`, so `alphabet[-1]` is `'z'`.
- If `n` is 28, `n - 28` is `0`, so `alphabet[0]` is `'a'`.
- If `n` is 52, `n - 28` is `24`, so `alphabet[24]` is `'y'`.

Thus, `word` will be `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input and `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `word` is the string 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'**.
