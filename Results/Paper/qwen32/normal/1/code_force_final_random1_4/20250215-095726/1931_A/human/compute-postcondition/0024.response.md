The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the variable `n` to the integer value of the user input. The other variables (`t`, `alphabet`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1**.
