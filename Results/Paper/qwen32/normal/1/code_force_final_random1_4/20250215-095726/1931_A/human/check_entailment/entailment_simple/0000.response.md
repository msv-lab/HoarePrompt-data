Let's analyze the logic of the provided program and compare it with the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that can be encoded to a given sum `n`.
- The sum `n` is calculated as the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet (where 'a' = 1, ..., 'z' = 26).
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Alphabet Mapping**: The program uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to map letters to their positions.
2. **Logic for Constructing Words**:
   - If `n > 52`, the program constructs a word of the form `Xzz`, where `X` is the letter corresponding to `n - 53`. This works because the maximum sum of two 'z's (52) plus any other letter is 78, which is the upper limit for `n`.
   - If `n > 26`, the program constructs a word of the form `aYz`, where `Y` is the letter corresponding to `n - 28`. This works because the maximum sum of 'a' (1) and 'z' (26) plus any other letter is 52.
   - If `n <= 26`, the program constructs a word of the form `aaZ`, where `Z` is the letter corresponding to `n - 3`. This works because the maximum sum of two 'a's (2) plus any other letter is 28.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the logic with some examples:
- For `n = 24`: The program constructs `aav` (`1 + 1 + 22 = 24`), which is correct.
- For `n = 70`: The program constructs `rzz` (`18 + 26 + 26 = 70`), which is correct.
- For `n = 3`: The program constructs `aaa` (`1 + 1 + 1 = 3`), which is correct.
- For `n = 55`: The program constructs `czz` (`3 + 26 + 26 = 55`), which is correct.
- For `n = 48`: The program constructs `auz` (`1 + 21 + 26 = 48`), which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the edge cases and provides the lexicographically smallest word for each possible value of `n` within the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly determines the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for each encoded sum `n` by using conditional logic to construct the appropriate word based on the value of `n`.

Correctness: **True**
