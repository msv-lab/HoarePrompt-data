The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n` based on the user's input. The other variables (`t`, `alphabet`, `word`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `word` is determined based on the value of `n` as described, `i` is incremented by 1**.

In simpler terms, the value of `n` is updated to whatever integer the user inputs, while the other variables retain their original values.
