### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness. We'll use the annotations and examples to validate or challenge the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given encoded integer `n`.
- The sum `n` is calculated as the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
- The letters are indexed from 1 ('a') to 26 ('z').
- We need to handle multiple test cases.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem using the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `n`.
3. Depending on the value of `n`, it constructs a 3-letter word:
   - If `n > 52`, it sets the first letter to `alphabet[n - 53]` and the last two letters to 'zz'.
   - If `52 >= n > 26`, it sets the first letter to 'a', the second letter to `alphabet[n - 28]`, and the third letter to 'z'.
   - If `n <= 26`, it sets the first two letters to 'aa' and the third letter to `alphabet[n - 3]`.

#### Correctness Check:
Let's verify if the provided logic correctly handles all possible values of `n` within the given constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).

1. **Case 1: n > 52**
   - For `n > 52`, the formula `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` is incorrect.
   - For example, for `n = 78`, the formula gives 'z' + 'zz' = 'zzz', but the correct answer should be 'rzz'. This is because 'rzz' (18 + 26 + 26 = 70) is not the smallest word for `n = 78`. The correct word should be 'rzz' for `n = 70` and 'szz' for `n = 79`, etc.

2. **Case 2: 26 < n ≤ 52**
   - For `26 < n ≤ 52`, the formula `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` is incorrect.
   - For example, for `n = 52`, the formula gives 'a' + 'y' + 'z' = 'ayz', but the correct answer should be 'czz'. This is because 'czz' (3 + 26 + 26 = 55) is not the smallest word for `n = 52`. The correct word should be 'czz' for `n = 55` and 'dzz' for `n = 56`, etc.

3. **Case 3: n ≤ 26**
   - For `n ≤ 26`, the formula `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` is incorrect.
   - For example, for `n = 3`, the formula gives 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa', which is correct, but this is a special case and doesn't generalize well. For `n = 4`, the formula gives 'aa' + 'b' = 'aab', which is correct, but for `n = 5`, the formula gives 'aa' + 'c' = 'aac', which is correct, and so on. However, this approach does not scale well for larger values of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases and does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
