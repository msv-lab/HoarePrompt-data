To determine the Output State, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is the integer value of the user input
- `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
- `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now `i + 1`)
- `word` is an empty string

Code Snippet:
```python
word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
```

Impact:
- The code appends a new substring to `word`. This substring consists of three parts:
  - The character `'a'`
  - The character from `alphabet` at index `n - 28`
  - The character `'z'`
- The value of `word` changes from an empty string to `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Let's consider the value of `n` more closely:
- Since `n` is the integer value of user input, and `alphabet` is indexed from 0 to 25, the expression `n - 28` must yield a valid index for `alphabet`. This implies `n - 28` should be between 0 and 25 inclusive.
- Therefore, `n` should be between 28 and 53 inclusive to ensure `n - 28` is a valid index for `alphabet`.

Given these considerations, the updated value of `word` will be `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`, where `alphabet[n - 28]` is a character from 'a' to 'z'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input (where 28 <= n <= 53), `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 1`, `word` is the string `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`**.
