You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input from the last iteration, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is equal to `t`. The loop has printed `t` lines, each containing the constructed `word` based on the respective `n` value from each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to decode an integer `n` into a lexicographically smallest 3-letter word.
- Each letter is represented by its position in the alphabet (a=1, ..., z=26).
- The sum of these positions should equal `n`.
- The output should be the lexicographically smallest word that satisfies this condition.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)
```

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the given examples and some edge cases:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `24`
   - Expected Output: `aav`
   - Program Output: `aav` (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `70`
   - Expected Output: `rzz`
   - Program Output: `rzz` (Correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `3`
   - Expected Output: `aaa`
   - Program Output: `aaa` (Correct)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `55`
   - Expected Output: `czz`
   - Program Output: `czz` (Correct)

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `48`
   - Expected Output: `auz`
   - Program Output: `auz` (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
- **Minimum Value (n=3):**
  - `n=3` should result in `aaa`, which is correct.
  
- **Maximum Value (n=78):**
  - `n=78` should result in `zzz`, which is not handled by the program. According to the logic, `n=78` would result in `alphabet[25] + 'zz'` which is `'z' + 'zz'` or `'zzz'`. This seems correct based on the provided logic.

- **Intermediate Values:**
  - Let's check `n=27`:
    - Expected: `aba` (since `1 + 2 + 24 = 27`)
    - Program Output: `aaz` (Incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The program fails for certain intermediate values like `n=27`. The logic used in the program does not cover all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it does not handle the construction of the word in a way that guarantees the lexicographically smallest word for all values of `n`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all values of `n` to produce the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for `n=27`, the program outputs `aaz` instead of the correct `aba`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
