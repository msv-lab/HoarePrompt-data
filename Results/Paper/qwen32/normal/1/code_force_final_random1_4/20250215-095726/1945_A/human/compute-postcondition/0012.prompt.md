Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
    b += c
    print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input list from open(0) must have at least t+1 elements where the first element is `t` and the next t elements are triples of integers a, b, c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer equal to its original value plus `c`, and `c` is an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input list from open(0) must have at least t+1 elements where the first element is `t` and the next t elements are triples of integers a, b, c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string `s` plus `c`, and `c` is the third integer from the split string `s`. `s` is the next triple (a, b, c) in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input list from open(0) must have at least t+1 elements where the first element is `t` and the next t elements are triples of integers a, b, c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `s` is the next triple (a, b, c) in the list, specifically the `(k+1)-th` triple `(a_{k+1}, b_{k+1}, c_{k+1})`; `a` is the first integer in `s`, `b` is the second integer in `s` plus the third integer in `s`, `c` is the third integer in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
