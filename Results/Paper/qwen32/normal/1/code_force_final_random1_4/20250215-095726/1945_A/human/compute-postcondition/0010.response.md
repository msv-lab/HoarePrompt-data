Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input list from open(0) must have at least t+1 elements where the first element is `t` and the next t elements are triples of integers a, b, c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `s` is the next triple (a, b, c) in the list, specifically the `(k+1)-th` triple `(a_{k+1}, b_{k+1}, c_{k+1})`; `a` is the first integer in `s`, `b` is the second integer in `s` plus the third integer in `s`, `c` is the third integer in `s`.**
