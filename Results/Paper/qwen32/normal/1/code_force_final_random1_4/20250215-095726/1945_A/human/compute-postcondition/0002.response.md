The code snippet provided only modifies the variable `b` by adding the value of `c` to it. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `c`) remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `b` is updated to `b + c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input list from open(0) must have at least t+1 elements where the first element is `t` and the next t elements are triples of integers a, b, c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer equal to its original value plus `c`, and `c` is an integer.**
