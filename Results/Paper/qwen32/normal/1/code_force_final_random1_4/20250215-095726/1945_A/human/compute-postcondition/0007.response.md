Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The input list from `open(0)` must have at least \(t+1\) elements.
- The first element is `t`.
- The next `t` elements are triples of integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).
- `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`.
- `b` is the second integer from the split string `s` plus `c`.
- `c` is the third integer from the split string `s`.
- `s` is the next triple \((a, b, c)\) in the list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Triple Extraction**:
   - For each triple \((a, b, c)\):
     - `a` is the first integer.
     - `b` is the second integer plus `c`.
     - `c` is the third integer.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is a tuple indexing operation:
     ```python
     (a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]
     ```
   - This means that the expression evaluates to either `a - -b // 3` or `-1` depending on the condition `c < b % 3`.

3. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `-1`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `a - -b // 3`.

4. **Simplifying the Expression**:
   - `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a + b // 3` because subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding the positive counterpart.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The output depends on the condition `c < b % 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the output is `-1`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the output is `a + b // 3`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be either `-1` or `a + b // 3` depending on the condition `c < b % 3`.

Output: **-1 if c < b % 3, otherwise a + b // 3 (where a, b, and c are the integers from the triple (a, b+c, c))**
