Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to determine the output:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The input list from `open(0)` contains at least \(t+1\) elements.
  - The first element is `t`.
  - The next `t` elements are triples of integers `(a, b, c)` where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer equal to its original value plus `c`.
- `c` is an integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Expression:**
   - The expression uses a tuple indexing trick to select between two values based on a condition.
   - The condition is `c < b % 3`.
     - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `-1`.
     - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `a - -b // 3`.

2. **Simplifying `a - -b // 3`:**
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` can be simplified to `a + b // 3`.
   - Here, `b` is the original `b` plus `c`, so `b = b_original + c`.

3. **Final Expression:**
   - The final expression becomes `a + (b_original + c) // 3`.

### Output Determination:
- Depending on the condition `c < b % 3`:
  - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the output is `-1`.
  - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the output is `a + (b_original + c) // 3`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each triple in the input list. Since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the condition and the formula.

Output: **-1 if c < b % 3, otherwise a + (b_original + c) // 3 (where a, b, and c are integers from the input list, and b_original is the original value of b before adding c)**
