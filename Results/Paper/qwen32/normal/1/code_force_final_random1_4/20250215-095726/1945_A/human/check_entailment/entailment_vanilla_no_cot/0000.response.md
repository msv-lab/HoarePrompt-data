To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze its logic against the problem requirements. Let's break down the problem and the code step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Introverts (a):** Each introvert needs a tent by themselves. Therefore, `a` tents are required for introverts.
2. **Extroverts (b):** Each extrovert needs to share a tent with two others, meaning every tent with an extrovert should have exactly 3 people. Therefore, the number of tents required for extroverts is `b / 3` (rounded up).
3. **Universals (c):** Universals can go into any type of tent. They can be used to fill up incomplete tents (where extroverts need more people to complete a group of 3).

### Logic of the Provided Code:
The code processes each test case as follows:
- It reads the input values `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It combines `b` and `c` into a single variable `b += c`. This step seems to treat universals as potential extroverts.
- It calculates the number of tents required for introverts as `a`.
- It then calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and potentially filled by universals using `-b // 3`. However, this part of the logic is incorrect because:
  - The negative sign before `b` does not make sense in this context.
  - The integer division `// 3` would give the number of full groups of 3, but it does not account for the remainder correctly.
- Finally, it checks if `c < b % 3` to determine if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. If not, it returns `-1`.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation:** The expression `-b // 3` is incorrect for calculating the number of tents. It should be `(b + 2) // 3` to properly round up the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
2. **Logic Error:** The condition `c < b % 3` is not sufficient to determine if the remaining spots can be filled by universals. We need to ensure that the total number of people (introverts, extroverts, and universals) can be perfectly divided into groups of 1 or 3.

### Corrected Logic:
1. Calculate the number of tents required for introverts: `tents_introverts = a`.
2. Calculate the number of tents required for extroverts and universals: `tents_extroverts_universals = (b + 2) // 3`.
3. Check if the remaining spots can be filled by universals. If not, return `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
