To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is `s` in this case. The loop iterates over the list starting from the second element (`[*open(0)][1:]`), meaning `s` will take each subsequent element in the list one by one.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- The input list from `open(0)` must have at least `t+1` elements.
- The first element of the list is `t`.
- The next `t` elements are triples of integers `(a, b, c)` such that `0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9`.
- `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`.
- `b` is the second integer from the split string `s` plus `c`.
- `c` is the third integer from the split string `s`.
- `s` is the next triple `(a, b, c)` in the list.

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` would have been the current triple being processed. For the next iteration, `s` should be the next triple in the list.

Let's denote the current index of `s` in the list as `k`. After processing the `k-th` triple, `s` would move to the `(k+1)-th` triple.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `s` was the `k-th` triple `(a_k, b_k, c_k)`.

For the next iteration, `s` should be the `(k+1)-th` triple `(a_{k+1}, b_{k+1}, c_{k+1})`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input list from open(0) must have at least t+1 elements where the first element is `t` and the next t elements are triples of integers a, b, c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `s` is the next triple (a, b, c) in the list, specifically the `(k+1)-th` triple `(a_{k+1}, b_{k+1}, c_{k+1})`**.
