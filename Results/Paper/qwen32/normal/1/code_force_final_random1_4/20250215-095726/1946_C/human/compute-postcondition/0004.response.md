Let's analyze the given for loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is:
```python
for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop body. The number of iterations is determined by the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- Input from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be a string representing an integer greater than 0.
- `solve()` has been executed.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we don't need to adjust its state. The only state that affects whether the loop continues is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`. After each iteration, this value is decremented by 1 (since `range` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the specified number).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **Input from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be a string representing an integer greater than 1, and `solve()` has been executed.**
