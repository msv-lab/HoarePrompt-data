Output State: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 1`, `pos = 3`, `rest = 8`, `delta = 2`. The element at index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `a` is out of bounds.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `pos` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `pos` is now 3, which is out of bounds for the `sorted_indices` list (which only has indices 0, 1, and 2), the element at `sorted_indices[pos]` in `a` is out of bounds.
