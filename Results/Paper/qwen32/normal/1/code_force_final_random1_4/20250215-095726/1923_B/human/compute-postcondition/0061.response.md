The code snippet `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. Given that `delta` is 0, `rest` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 2`, `pos = 0`, `rest = 10`, `delta = 0`**

In natural language, the output state is: `a` is `[0, 0, 0]`, `x` is `[-2, 1, -3]`, `k` is `10`, `n` is `3`, `sorted_indices` is `[1, 0, 2]`, `distance` is `2`, `pos` is `0`, `rest` remains `10`, and `delta` is `0`.
