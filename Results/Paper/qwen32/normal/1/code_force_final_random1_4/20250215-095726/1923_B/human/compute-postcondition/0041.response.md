To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head: `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.

### Current State:
- `a = [0, 0, 0]`
- `x = [-2, 1, -3]`
- `k = 10`
- `n = 3`
- `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`
- `distance = 1`
- `rest = 8`
- `delta = 2`
- `pos` is either 2 (if `a[sorted_indices[pos]] != 0`) or 3 (if `a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0`)

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `rest != 0`:**
   - Currently, `rest = 8`, which satisfies `rest != 0`.

2. **Condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)`:**
   - `len(sorted_indices)` is 3.
   - If `pos` is 2, then `pos != len(sorted_indices)` is `2 != 3`, which is `True`.
   - If `pos` is 3, then `pos != len(sorted_indices)` is `3 != 3`, which is `False`.

### Conclusion:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `pos` must be 2 (since `pos` being 3 would terminate the loop).
- `rest` should remain 8 (or any non-zero value), but since it's already 8, no change is needed here.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 1`, `rest = 8`, `delta = 2`, `pos = 2`**
