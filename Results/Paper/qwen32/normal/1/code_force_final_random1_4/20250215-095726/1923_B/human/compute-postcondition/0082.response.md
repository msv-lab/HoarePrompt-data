Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, which is a list of integers representing the health of `n` monsters; `x`, which is a list of integers representing the initial positions of `n` monsters such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i; and `k`, which is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. The function returns `False` in three different cases (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3) and returns `True` in Case_4.**
