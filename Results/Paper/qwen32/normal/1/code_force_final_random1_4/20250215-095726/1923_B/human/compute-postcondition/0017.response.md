Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `a`, a list of integers representing the health of each monster; `x`, a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster; and `k`, an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. The lengths of `a` and `x` are equal and represent the number of monsters, `n`. The function returns the minimum time required to defeat all the monsters given the constraints.**
