Output State: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 1`, `rest` must be non-zero, `delta = 0`, `pos` must be less than 3, `pos` is 1**.

Natural Language: The value of `pos` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
