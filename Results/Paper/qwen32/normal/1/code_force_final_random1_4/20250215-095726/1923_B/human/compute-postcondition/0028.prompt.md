Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of `n` monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of `n` monsters such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i, `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, `n` is the length of the list `a` and must be greater than 0, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is 0, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not equal to `distance`; `rest` is `k`.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers where `a[sorted_indices[0]]` is reduced by `delta`; `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of `n` monsters; `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second; `n` is the length of the list `a` and must be greater than 0; `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`; `distance` is 0; `pos` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0 or not; `rest` is `k - delta`; `delta` is `min(k, a[sorted_indices[0]])`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, then `pos` is set to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of integers where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta` if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was not 0. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, then `a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]]` is reduced by `delta` instead. `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of `n` monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, `n` is the length of the list `a` and is greater than 0, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` and the subsequent reduction, and `rest` is `k - 2 * delta`. `delta` is `min(k - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was not 0, otherwise `delta` is `min(k - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]])`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of integers where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta` unless `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was initially 0. `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of `n` monsters. `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second such that `k > 2 * delta`. `n` is the length of the list `a` and is greater than 0. `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`. `distance` is 0. `pos` is either 0, 1, or 2. `rest` is `k - 3 * delta`. `delta` is `min(k - 2 * delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` unless `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was initially 0, in which case `pos` is updated to be either 1, 2, or 3 and `delta` is recalculated as `min(k - 2 * delta, a[sorted_indices[pos-1]])`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
