To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head: `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.

Given:
- `rest = 8`: This condition is satisfied since `rest` is not equal to 0.
- `pos` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, but we know that if `a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0`, then `pos` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged. Since `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `len(sorted_indices) = 3`.

For the loop to continue executing, `pos` should be less than 3 (since `pos != len(sorted_indices)`). If `pos` were 3, the loop would terminate because `pos` would equal `len(sorted_indices)`.

Since `pos` is not explicitly given, let's assume it could be any value that allows the loop to continue. The most straightforward assumption is that `pos` is currently less than 3, and we need to ensure it remains in that range.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `rest` remains non-zero and `pos` is less than 3.

State: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 1`, `rest` must be non-zero, `delta = 0`, `pos` must be less than 3**
