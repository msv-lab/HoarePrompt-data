You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it computes a result based on these counts and prints the result. The result is determined by checking if exactly three out of the first three counts (ones, twos, threes) are odd, and then adding half the sum of all four counts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time optimally to maximize Bob's wins.
- Each number in the sequence is either 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Key Points:
- XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.
- Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in binary are `01`, `10`, `11`, and `100` respectively.
- To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero by removing numbers optimally.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Adjustment of Counts**: The line `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` incorrectly adjusts the counts. It should not modify the counts of the numbers.
2. **Logic for Determining Bob's Wins**:
   - `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if exactly three of the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are odd. This is not a correct condition to determine when Bob can win.
   - `sum(p) // 2` is also not a correct formula to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly:
1. Count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, 4).
2. Determine the parity (odd/even) of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s (since 4s do not affect the XOR result).
3. Calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win by ensuring the XOR becomes zero optimally.

### Correct Solution Example:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        odd_count = sum(1 for count in p[:3] if count % 2 != 0)
        total_numbers = sum(p)
        bob_wins = (odd_count == 3) + (total_numbers // 2)
        print(bob_wins)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The original program incorrectly modifies the counts and uses an incorrect condition to determine Bob's wins. The logic for determining when Bob can win is flawed, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
