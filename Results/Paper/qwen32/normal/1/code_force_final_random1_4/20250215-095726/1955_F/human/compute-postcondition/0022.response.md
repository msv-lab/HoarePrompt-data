Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `p_1` is the first element of `a`, `p_2` is the second element of `a` if it exists, `p_3` is the third element of `a` if it exists, `p_4` is the fourth element of `a` if it exists, `x` is the next element in the list `a` after the previously processed element, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`**

In natural language: The list `a` remains unchanged, along with its elements `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `p_4`. The variable `x` also remains the same as it was before. The variable `cnt` is updated by adding the floor division of `x` by 2 to its previous value.
