Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `x // i > 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
