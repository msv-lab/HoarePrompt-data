To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\)
- `n` is an integer
- `i` is incremented by 1

We need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. The variable `x` does not change within the loop head.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. Therefore, `i` is the only variable that needs adjustment.
2. **Adjusting `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increase `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.
3. **Condition Check**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. We need to ensure that the new value of `i` satisfies this condition.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To make it more precise:
- If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
- If `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.
- And so on...

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the incremented value of `i`.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

If we denote the old value of `i` as `i_old`, the new value of `i` will be `i_new = i_old + 1`.

So, if `i` was `i_old` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an integer, `i` is `i_old + 1`**.
