Given the code snippet `ans = max(ans, x // i)`, we need to determine the new value of `ans` based on the initial state provided.

- `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1.
- `n` is an input integer (its value does not affect the calculation of `ans` in this snippet).
- `q` is incremented by 1 (this does not affect the calculation of `ans` in this snippet).
- `i` is 5 (a constant value in this context).
- `ans` retains its previous value unless `x - n * 5 >= 0` and `(x - n * 5) % 5 == 0`. If these conditions are met, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 4`. Otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value.

However, the code snippet only updates `ans` to the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. Since `i` is 5, `x // i` is equivalent to `x // 5`.

Thus, the new value of `ans` will be the maximum of its previous value and `x // 5`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 5, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // 5`.**
