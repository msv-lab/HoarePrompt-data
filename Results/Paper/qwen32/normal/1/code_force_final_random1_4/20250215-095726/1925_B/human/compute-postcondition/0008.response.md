Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer; `x` is divisible by `i`; `x // i` is greater than 0; `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by `x // i`. The current value of `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i`.**
