Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `q` is incremented by 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `x // i > 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value.**
