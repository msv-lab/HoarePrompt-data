Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer; `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then the current value of `ans` is the maximum of 1, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.**
