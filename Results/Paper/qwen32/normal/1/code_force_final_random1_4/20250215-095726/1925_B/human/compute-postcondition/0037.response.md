Postcondition: **`x` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of 1, `i`, and `x // i` provided that `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)` is equal to 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
