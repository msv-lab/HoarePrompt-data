You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest divisor `i` of `x` such that `(x - n * i)` is also divisible by `i` and non-negative.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`, and maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of these difficulties.
- **Constraints**:
  - Number of test cases `t`: \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
  - Difficulty `x`: \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\)
  - Number of sub-problems `n`: \(1 \leq n \leq x\)

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to its square root. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` can be split into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty of `i` or `x // i`. If so, it updates the maximum GCD found (`ans`).

### Key Points:
1. **Divisor Check**: The program checks divisors up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient.
2. **Feasibility Check**: For each divisor `i`, it checks if the remaining difficulty after distributing `n` parts of size `i` can still be divided evenly by `i`.
3. **Symmetric Check**: It also checks the symmetric divisor `x // i`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Cases**: We need to ensure that the program handles edge cases properly, such as when `x` is small or when `n` is close to `x`.
2. **Correctness**: The logic seems sound, but we need to verify that it covers all scenarios.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with some edge cases and typical cases to ensure correctness.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `1 10 3`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: One possible division is `[4, 2, 4]`, and the GCD is `2`.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `1 5 5`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Explanation: The only possible division is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, and the GCD is `1`.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `1 420 69`
- Expected Output: `6`
- Explanation: One possible division is `[6, 6, ..., 6]` (69 times), and the GCD is `6`.

#### Additional Test Case:
- Input: `1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Explanation: The only possible division is `[1]`, and the GCD is `1`.

#### Additional Test Case:
- Input: `1 100 1`
- Expected Output: `100`
- Explanation: The only possible division is `[100]`, and the GCD is `100`.

### Conclusion:
After testing the program with various inputs, including edge cases, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly. The logic ensures that the GCD is maximized by checking all possible divisors and ensuring the feasibility of dividing `x` into `n` parts.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program efficiently checks all possible divisors of `x` and ensures that the difficulties can be divided into `n` parts such that the GCD is maximized. It handles edge cases and typical cases correctly, producing the expected output for all tested scenarios.
