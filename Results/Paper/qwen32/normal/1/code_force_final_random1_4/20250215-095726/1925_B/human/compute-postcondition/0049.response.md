Postcondition: **`x` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is still less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If `x % i == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. Additionally, if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. Furthermore, if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. If `x % i != 0`, no changes are made to `ans`.**
