Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i` since `(x - n * (x // i)) >= 0`, `(x // i) > 0`, and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`. `q` is incremented by 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`.**
