The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 4, `ans` will be updated to 4 if its current value is less than 4. If `ans` is already 4 or greater, it will retain its value.

Since the initial state specifies that `ans` retains its previous value until the next update condition is met, and the only update condition here is `max(ans, i)`, `ans` will be set to 4 if it was previously less than 4.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 4, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and 4.**
