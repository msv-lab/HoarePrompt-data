The code reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `int(input())` returns `t`. However, the subsequent line of code does not involve `t` directly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` and `n` are integers obtained from the input, split by space.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `x` and `n` are now assigned the integer values provided in the input, separated by a space.
