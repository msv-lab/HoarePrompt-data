To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can see that the variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `lis`, and implicitly `len(lis)`. 

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `j`:**
   - `j` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.
   - No adjustment is needed for `j` before the loop starts because it is automatically set by the `range` function.

2. **Variable `lis`:**
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the map object `l`.
   - The condition for the loop to execute is that `len(lis)` must be greater than 1. This ensures that the `range(1, len(lis))` generates at least one value (since `range(1, 2)` would generate `[1]`).

3. **Condition `len(lis) > 1`:**
   - For the loop to execute, `len(lis)` must be greater than 1.
   - This implies that `lis` must contain at least two unique integers.

### Adjustments:

- We need to ensure that `lis` has more than one element.
- Since `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers, having more than one element means that `lis` should contain at least two distinct integers.

### Final State:

Given the above analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `lis` has more than one element. Here's how the state should look:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1; `test` is `True`.**

This ensures that the `for` loop can execute because `len(lis) > 1` will be true, allowing `range(1, len(lis))` to generate at least one value for `j`.
