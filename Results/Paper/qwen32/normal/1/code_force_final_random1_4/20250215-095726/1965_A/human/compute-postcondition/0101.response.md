The code snippet provided sets the variable `test` to `False`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `j`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `test` is `False`.**
