Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is another input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, and `j` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will simply output the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
