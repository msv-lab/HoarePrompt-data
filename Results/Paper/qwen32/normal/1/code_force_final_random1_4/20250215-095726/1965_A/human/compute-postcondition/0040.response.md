Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that contains the integer 1 and has a length greater than 1, and `test` is `True`. Regardless of whether the length of `lis` is odd or even, `lis` maintains its properties as described.**
