To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `A` is initially `False`.
   - `not_c` is initially `True`.
   - `set_` is a sorted version of `arr`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `len(set_) - 1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if the difference between the current element (`set_[i]`) and the previous element (`set_[i - 1]`) is greater than 1.
   - If the difference is greater than 1, `not_c` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
   - If the difference is not greater than 1, `A` is toggled (`A = not A`).

### Final Output State:
- The loop will iterate through all elements in `set_` unless it breaks early due to finding a difference greater than 1.
- After each iteration, `A` alternates between `True` and `False`.
- `not_c` remains `True` until a difference greater than 1 is found.

### Determining the Final Value of `A`:
- Since `A` starts as `False` and alternates with each iteration, its final value depends on the number of iterations:
  - If the number of iterations is even, `A` will be `False`.
  - If the number of iterations is odd, `A` will be `True`.

### Determining the Final Value of `not_c`:
- `not_c` remains `True` unless a difference greater than 1 is found during any iteration.
- If no such difference is found, `not_c` will be `True` after all iterations.

### Conclusion:
- The final value of `A` depends on whether the number of iterations is even or odd.
- The final value of `not_c` depends on whether any difference greater than 1 was found.

Since the exact number of iterations and the values in `set_` are not provided, we can't definitively say whether `A` will be `True` or `False`. However, we can provide the general form of the output state based on these conditions.

### Final Output State:
- `arr` remains the same as the initial state.
- `A` will be either `True` or `False` depending on the number of iterations.
- `set_` remains the sorted version of `arr`.
- `not_c` will be `True` if no difference greater than 1 was found, otherwise `False`.

Given the above, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`arr` is unchanged, `A` is either `True` or `False` depending on the number of iterations, `set_` is the sorted version of `arr`, `not_c` is `True` if no difference greater than 1 was found, otherwise `False`.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is:
- `arr` remains the same.
- `A` alternates between `True` and `False` based on the number of iterations.
- `set_` is still the sorted version of `arr`.
- `not_c` is `True` if all consecutive differences in `set_` are 1 or less, otherwise `False`.
