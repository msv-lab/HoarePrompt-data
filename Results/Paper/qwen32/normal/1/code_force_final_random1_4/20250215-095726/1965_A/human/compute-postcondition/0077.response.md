The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `test`). Therefore, regardless of the values or states of these variables, the output of the `print` statement will always be the string `'Bob'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` is another integer input.
- `l` is a map object containing integers.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 4 elements and an even length.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though its initial value is not specified).
- `test` is set to `True`.

None of these variables or their values affect the `print('Bob')` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply:

Output: **Bob**
