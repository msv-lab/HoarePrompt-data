Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `test` remains unchanged.**
