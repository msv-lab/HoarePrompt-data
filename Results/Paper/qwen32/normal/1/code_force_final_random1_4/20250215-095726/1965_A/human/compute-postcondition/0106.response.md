Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is another input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Alice'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `j`) are used within this specific `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this statement.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the string `'Alice'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
