Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with more than one element, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted version of `arr` with more than one element, `not_c` is False, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is nested within, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `arr`, `A`, `set_`, `not_c`, and `i` remain unchanged.
