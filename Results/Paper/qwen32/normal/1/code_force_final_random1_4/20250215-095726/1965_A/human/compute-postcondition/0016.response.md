Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with more than one element, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted version of `arr` with more than one element, `i` is 2. If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, then `not_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains unchanged.**
