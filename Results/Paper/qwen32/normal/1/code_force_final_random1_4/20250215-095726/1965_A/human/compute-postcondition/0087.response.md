To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and focus only on the objects mentioned in the loop head.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The objects in the loop head are `j`, `range`, `1`, and `len(lis)`. However, since `1` is a constant and `range` is a built-in function, the only variable we can adjust is `lis`.

For the loop to execute, `len(lis)` must be greater than 1. This is because the `range` function generates numbers starting from the first argument (inclusive) up to the second argument (exclusive). Therefore, `range(1, len(lis))` will generate at least one number if `len(lis)` is greater than 1.

Given this, we need to ensure that `lis` contains more than one element.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element; `i` is `i + 1`; `test` is True**
