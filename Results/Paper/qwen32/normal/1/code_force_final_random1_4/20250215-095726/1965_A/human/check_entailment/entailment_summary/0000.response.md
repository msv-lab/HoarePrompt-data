Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the rules described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why:

1. **Game Rules Misinterpretation**: The game revolves around the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) in combinatorial game theory. The key insight is that the game is equivalent to a Nim game where the winning strategy depends on whether the XOR of all pile sizes is zero or not. If the XOR-sum is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move (Alice in this case); otherwise, it is winning.

2. **Incorrect Logic in Code**: 
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly checks the first element of `arr` to decide the winner, which has no bearing on the game's outcome.
   - It also examines the sorted unique elements of `arr` to determine the winner, which is not relevant to the game rules.

3. **Expected Logic**:
   - For each test case, compute the XOR of all pile sizes.
   - If the XOR is zero, Bob wins because Alice faces a losing position.
   - Otherwise, Alice wins because she can force a win with optimal play.

Here is the corrected version of the function based on the above logic:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    xor_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        xor_sum ^= num
    return 'Alice' if xor_sum != 0 else 'Bob'
```

Given these points, the original program does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules.

Correctness: **False**
