### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. Here's a detailed explanation:

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Nim-sum (XOR-sum):** In combinatorial game theory, the XOR-sum of the pile sizes determines the winner in impartial games like this one. If the XOR-sum of all pile sizes is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move (Alice in this case). Otherwise, it is winning for the player about to move.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
- The function `func_1` does not compute the XOR-sum of the pile sizes.
- Instead, it checks if the sorted unique pile sizes form a consecutive sequence starting from 1. This condition is not related to determining the winner based on optimal play.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
- The XOR of the pile sizes is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0`.
- Since the XOR-sum is zero, Alice cannot force a win, and Bob will win if both play optimally.

However, the provided code would likely return "Alice" for this input, which is incorrect.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly determine the winner, the code should compute the XOR-sum of the pile sizes and return "Alice" if the XOR-sum is non-zero, otherwise "Bob".

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    xor_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        xor_sum ^= num
    return 'Alice' if xor_sum != 0 else 'Bob'
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the XOR-sum of the pile sizes.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
