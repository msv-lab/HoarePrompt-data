Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` is `j + 1`. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.**
