The code snippet provided updates the variable `l` to be a map object containing integers from the new input. This means that the previous value of `l` is overwritten with the new map object. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lis`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from the previous `l`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
