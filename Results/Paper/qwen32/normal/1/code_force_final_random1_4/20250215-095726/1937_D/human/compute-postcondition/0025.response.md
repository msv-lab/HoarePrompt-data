The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. This means `idx_A` will now include `i` as its last element. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `i_prev`, `A`, `x`) remain unchanged unless they were dependent on `idx_A` in their definitions.

Given the initial state, the updated state is:

- `s` remains a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` remains the length of the string `s` and is still greater than 0.
- `i` remains `i_prev + 2`.
- `idx_A` now includes `i` as its last element.
- The conditions for `A` and `x` remain as described, but since `idx_A` has changed, `x` would be recalculated if needed based on the new `idx_A`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 2`; `idx_A` includes `i` as its last element.**
