The code snippet provided appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty.
- `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<'.
- `i` is `n - 1 - j`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

After executing `idx_B.append(i)`, the only variable that changes is `idx_B`, which now includes the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty; `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i`; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; `j` is `j + 1`.**
