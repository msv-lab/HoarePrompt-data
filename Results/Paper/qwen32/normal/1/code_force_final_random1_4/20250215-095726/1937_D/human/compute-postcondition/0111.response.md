Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1; `a` is `B[r]`; `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.**

In natural language: The string `s` remains unchanged, and its length `n` remains the same. The lists `A` and `idx_A` containing computed values and indices of '>' characters respectively remain unchanged. Similarly, the lists `B` and `idx_B` containing computed values and indices of '<' characters respectively remain unchanged. The variables `l` and `r` also remain unchanged. The variable `a` remains `B[r]`. The variable `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.
