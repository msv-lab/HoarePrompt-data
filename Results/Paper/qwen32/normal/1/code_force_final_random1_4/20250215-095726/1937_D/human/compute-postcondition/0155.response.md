The code modifies the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `r` is decreased by 1; `a` is `B[r]`; `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**.
