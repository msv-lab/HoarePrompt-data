To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `i` is `i_end + 2`.
- `r` is decreased by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `i + 1` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is defined as `i_end + 2`.
- Therefore, the expression `i + 1` can be rewritten as `(i_end + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `i_end + 3`.

### Conclusion:
The value printed will be `i_end + 3`. Since the exact value of `i_end` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **i_end + 3 (where i_end is a variable defined in the context of the program)**
