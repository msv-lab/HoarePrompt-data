The code snippet assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `r` has been decreased by 1, so `a` will take the value of the element at the index `r` in the list `B`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `r` is decreased by 1; `a` is `B[r]`.**

In natural language: The value of `a` is now set to the element at index `r` in the list `B`. All other variables retain their previous values.
