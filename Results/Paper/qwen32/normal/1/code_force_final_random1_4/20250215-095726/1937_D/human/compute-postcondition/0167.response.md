The given code snippet modifies the value of `b` based on the expression `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged unless they are part of the expression used to compute `b`.

Given:
- `i` is `i_end + 2`
- `l` is an index related to `A`
- `r` is another index related to `B`
- `idx_B` contains indices of '<' in `s`

After executing the line `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, the value of `b` is updated.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `a` is `A[l]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is `(B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged. Now, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `b` is now calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
