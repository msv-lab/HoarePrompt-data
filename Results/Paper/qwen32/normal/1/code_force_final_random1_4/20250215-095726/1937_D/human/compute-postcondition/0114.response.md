To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **String `s`**: It consists of '<' and '>' characters.
2. **Length `n`**: This is the length of the string `s` and is greater than 0.
3. **List `A`**: Contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
4. **List `idx_A`**: Contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
5. **List `B`**: Contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
6. **List `idx_B`**: Contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
7. **Variable `l`**: Initialized to 0.
8. **Variable `r`**: Set to the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1.
9. **Variable `a`**: Set to `B[r]`.
10. **Variable `b`**: Initially undefined but later updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[-1]) * (r + 1)`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Value of `a`**: `a` is set to `B[r]`. Since `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1, `a` is the last element of the list `B`.
- **Value of `b`**: `b` is initially undefined but is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[-1]) * (r + 1)`. However, without knowing the initial value of `b` or the value of `i`, we cannot determine the exact value of `b` directly from the given information. But we can describe it in terms of the formula used to update it.
- **Value of `n`**: This is the length of the string `s`.
- **Value of `i`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, since it is used in the formula for updating `b`, we can describe the output in terms of `i`.

### Output Description:

Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement can be described as follows:
- `a * 2`: Twice the value of the last element in list `B`.
- `b * 2`: Twice the value of `b` after it has been updated using the formula `(i - idx_A[-1]) * (r + 1)`.
- `(n - i)`: The difference between the length of the string `s` and the value of `i`.

Since the exact values of `b` and `i` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a is B[r], b is updated to its previous value plus (i - idx_A[-1]) * (r + 1), n is the length of the string s, and i is an index in the string s)**
