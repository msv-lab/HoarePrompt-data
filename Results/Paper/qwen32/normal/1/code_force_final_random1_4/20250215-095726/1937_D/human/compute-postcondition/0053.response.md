The code snippet `B.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. This means that the length of `B` increases by one, and the last element of `B` is now `x`.

Given the initial state, `B` already contains some elements, and `x` is calculated based on the conditions provided. Specifically, `x` is defined as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.

After appending `x` to `B`, the new state of `B` will include this newly added element. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged unless they are directly modified in the code snippet, which they are not in this case.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` contains its previous elements plus the new element `x`, `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<', `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**.
