To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **String `s`**: It consists of '<' and '>' characters. The length of `s` is `n` and `n > 0`.

2. **Indices and Computed Values**:
   - `idx_A`: Contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
   - `A`: Contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
   - `idx_B`: Contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
   - `B`: Contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.

3. **Variables**:
   - `i`: Is set to `i_end + 2`.
   - `r`: Is decreased by 1.
   - `a`: Is set to `B[r]`.
   - `b`: Is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

Given these definitions, let's analyze the expression inside the `print` statement:

- `a * 2`: Since `a` is `B[r]`, this term will be twice the value of the element at index `r` in the list `B`.
- `b * 2`: This term will be twice the value of `b`.
- `(n - i)`: This term represents the difference between the length of the string `s` and the current value of `i`.

The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function indicates that after printing the result, a space will be added instead of the default newline character.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Thus, the output will be:

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a is B[r], b is updated to b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1), i is i_end + 2, and n is the length of the string s)**
