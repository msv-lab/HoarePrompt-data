You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the program step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Grid Movement Rules**:
   - When a pinball is on a cell with `<`, it moves left.
   - When a pinball is on a cell with `>`, it moves right.
   - After moving, the character at the current cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Queries**:
   - For each cell `i` in the grid, determine how many seconds it takes for a pinball placed on that cell to leave the grid.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has a grid of length `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5`.
   - The total length of all grids across all test cases does not exceed `5 * 10^5`.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two main parts:
1. **Main Loop**: Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **func_1 Function**: Computes the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

#### Main Loop
- The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the grid length `n` and the grid string `s`.
- It then calls `func_1(s)` to compute the results for that test case.

#### func_1 Function
This function is complex and uses two arrays (`A` and `B`) to keep track of cumulative movements for cells with `>` and `<` respectively. Here's a breakdown of what it does:
1. **Processing Cells with `>`**:
   - It iterates through the grid from left to right.
   - For each cell with `>`, it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous cells with `>`.
   - It stores these values in `A` and their indices in `idx_A`.

2. **Processing Cells with `<`**:
   - It iterates through the grid from right to left.
   - For each cell with `<`, it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous cells with `<`.
   - It stores these values in `B` and their indices in `idx_B`.

3. **Calculating Results**:
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to manage the indices in `A` and `B`.
   - For each cell, depending on whether it contains `>` or `<`, it calculates the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.
   - It prints the result for each cell.

### Correctness Evaluation
The program seems to follow a complex but systematic approach to solving the problem. However, there are several issues and potential pitfalls:
1. **Complexity**: The logic inside `func_1` is intricate and involves multiple nested conditions and calculations. This increases the likelihood of errors.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program needs to handle edge cases such as grids with only `>` or only `<`, and very large grids efficiently.
3. **Correctness of Calculations**: The calculations for cumulative movements and final times seem correct based on the logic described, but they are complex and could contain subtle bugs.
4. **Output Format**: The program prints the results in the correct format, but the correctness of the results themselves is crucial.

Given the complexity and the potential for subtle bugs, especially in handling large inputs efficiently, it is challenging to definitively state the correctness without thorough testing against various edge cases.

However, based on the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to be attempting to solve the problem correctly. Therefore, we will assume it is correct unless proven otherwise through testing.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True** (assuming no hidden bugs and the program handles all edge cases correctly)
