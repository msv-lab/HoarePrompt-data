To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression being printed:

### Initial State Recap:
- `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1, and currently `r` is 0.
- At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is not '>'.
- `l` is greater than `r`.

Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is 0, and `l` is supposed to be greater than `r`, this suggests a special case where there might be no '<' characters in `s` (since `r` would be -1 if there were no '<' characters, but it's explicitly stated as 0). However, since `l` is 0 and `l > r`, it implies that there are no '>' characters either because `idx_A` would be empty, making `l` undefined in the usual sense. But given the context, let's assume `l` being 0 means we are considering the position before the first '>' character, which doesn't exist.

### Expression Analysis:
The expression being printed is:
```python
n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2
```

- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `i` is the current index in the string `s` where `s[i]` is not '>'.
- `idx_A[l - 1]` refers to the index of the last '>' character before the current position `i`. Since `l` is 0, `l - 1` is -1, which means we are trying to access the last element of `idx_A` if it existed. Given the constraints, `idx_A` is likely empty, so this part of the expression is problematic.

However, since `l` is 0 and `l > r`, and `r` is 0, it implies that there are no '>' characters in `s`. Therefore, `idx_A` is an empty list, and accessing `idx_A[-1]` would normally raise an error. But for the sake of this problem, let's assume that `idx_A[-1]` is treated as a special case, possibly referring to a default value or a boundary condition.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, let's assume `idx_A[-1]` is treated as 0 (the start of the string) for the purpose of calculation, even though it's not explicitly defined.

### Calculation:
Let's assume `idx_A[-1]` is 0 for the calculation:
- `n - i`: This is the remaining length of the string from the current index `i` to the end.
- `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: Since `idx_A[l - 1]` is 0, this becomes `(i - 0) * 2 = i * 2`.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
```python
n - i + i * 2 = n - i + 2i = n + i
```

### Final Output:
The print statement will output `n + i`.

Output: **n + i**
