The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value, let's call it `i_end`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`
- `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`
- `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`
- `l` and `r` are counters for '>' and '<' respectively
- `a` and `b` are updated based on the relationships between `l` and `r`

Since only `i` can be adjusted, we increment `i` by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`**
