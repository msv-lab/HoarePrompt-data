To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the expression step-by-step using the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and their meanings**:
   - `s`: A string consisting of '<' and '>'.
   - `n`: The length of the string `s`.
   - `A`: Contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
   - `idx_A`: Contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
   - `B`: Contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
   - `idx_B`: Contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
   - `i`: Set to `i_end + 1`.
   - `r`: Decreased by 1 (though `r` is not used in the print statement).

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`

Let's analyze each part of the expression:

- `n`: This is simply the length of the string `s`.
- `i`: This is set to `i_end + 1`. Without knowing the exact value of `i_end`, we can only say it is one more than `i_end`.
- `idx_A[l - 1]`: This refers to the last element in the list `idx_A` if `l` is the length of `idx_A`. `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.

Given this, the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` can be interpreted as follows:

- `n - i`: This computes the difference between the length of the string and `i`.
- `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: This computes twice the difference between `i` and the last index of '>' in the string `s`.

Combining these, the expression calculates a value based on the length of the string, the position of `i`, and the last occurrence of '>' in the string.

Since we don't have specific values for `s`, `i_end`, or `l`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2 (where n is the length of the string s, i is i_end + 1, idx_A[l - 1] is the last index of '>' in s)**
