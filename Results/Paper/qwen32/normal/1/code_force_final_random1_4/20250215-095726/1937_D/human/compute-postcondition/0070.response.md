The given code snippet updates the value of `b` based on the current index `i`, the value of `l`, and the position of the last '<' character in the string `s` (which is `idx_B[r - 1]`). The new value of `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is less than `r`; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`; At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is '>'; `a` is `A[l]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`; `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.**

In simple terms, the value of `b` has been updated to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
