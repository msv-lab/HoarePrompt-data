The code appends the value `0` to the list `A`. The variables `s`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `A` has a new element `0` appended to it.**
