To determine the new value of `b` after the given operation, we need to apply the formula provided in the code snippet:

```python
b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
```

Given the initial state, `b` is initially `B[r - 1] - B[x]`. Let's substitute and simplify the expression.

1. **Initial Value of `b`:**
   \[
   b = B[r - 1] - B[x]
   \]

2. **New Value of `b` after the operation:**
   \[
   b = (B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
   \]

Let's denote the new value of `b` as `b_new`.

\[
b_{new} = B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
\]

This is the updated value of `b` after the operation.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is less than `r`; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`; At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is '>'; `a` is `A[l]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)` and `x` is greater than or equal to 0; `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.**
