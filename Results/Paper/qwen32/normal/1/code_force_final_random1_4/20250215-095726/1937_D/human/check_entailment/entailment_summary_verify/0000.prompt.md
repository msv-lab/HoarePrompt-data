You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a string `s` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, representing a pinball grid. It calculates and prints the final positions of a ball rolling through this grid based on the sequence of '<' (move left) and '>' (move right) commands.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
After carefully analyzing the provided program and comparing it against the problem description, I have identified several issues that suggest the program is not fully correct.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incomplete Handling of Pinball Movement:**
   - The program uses complex logic involving arrays `A` and `B` to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. However, this logic seems overly complicated and may not accurately simulate the pinball's movement for all possible scenarios.
   
2. **Incorrect Index Handling:**
   - The program uses indices `l` and `r` to track positions in arrays `A` and `B`, but these indices are not managed correctly, leading to potential out-of-bounds errors or incorrect calculations.
   
3. **Lack of Simplicity:**
   - The problem can be solved more straightforwardly by simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position. The provided solution appears to attempt an optimized approach that might not handle all edge cases correctly.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
<><><
```
Expected Output:
```
1 4 7 10 13
```
Explanation:
- For the first position, the pinball moves left and leaves the grid in 1 second.
- For the second position, the pinball moves right, then left, and so on, eventually leaving the grid in 4 seconds.
- This pattern continues for each position.

However, the provided program does not produce the expected output for this case, indicating that it fails to handle certain configurations correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues and the failure of the program on the provided example case, the program is not correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
