The code snippet creates an empty list `A`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is the length of the string `s`. Since the code does not modify `s` or `n`, these remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `A`, which is initialized as an empty list.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of the string `s`, `A` is an empty list.**
