Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the directions.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of cumulative movements and their respective indices (`idx_A` and `idx_B`).

3. **Processing '>' Directions:**
   - For each position `i` in the string `s` where `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the cumulative movement and stores it in `A`. The index `i` is also stored in `idx_A`.

4. **Processing '<' Directions:**
   - Similarly, for each position `i` in the reversed string `s` where `s[i]` is '<', it calculates the cumulative movement and stores it in `B`. The index `i` is also stored in `idx_B`.

5. **Calculating Output:**
   - Two pointers `l` and `r` are initialized to manage the indices of `A` and `B` respectively.
   - For each position `i` in the string `s`, the program determines whether the direction is '>' or '<'.
   - Depending on the direction, it uses the cumulative movements stored in `A` and `B` to compute the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from that position.
   - The computed times are printed for each position.

### Issues Identified:

- **Complexity and Logic Errors:**
  - The logic for calculating the cumulative movements and using them to determine the total time seems overly complex and may contain errors.
  - The calculations involving `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` are intricate and may not correctly account for all edge cases, especially when the pinball moves back and forth between cells with alternating directions.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not explicitly handle scenarios where the pinball might move back and forth indefinitely without leaving the grid, although the problem guarantees that the pinball will always leave the grid within a finite number of steps.
  - However, the complexity and structure of the program suggest potential issues in handling such scenarios correctly.

- **Output Formatting:**
  - The program prints the results for each test case on the same line separated by spaces, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:

Given the complexity and the lack of explicit handling for certain edge cases, it is difficult to assert with confidence that the program is entirely correct for all possible inputs within the given constraints. While the program may work for some test cases, it is likely to fail for others due to potential logical errors in the way cumulative movements are calculated and used.

**Correctness: False**
