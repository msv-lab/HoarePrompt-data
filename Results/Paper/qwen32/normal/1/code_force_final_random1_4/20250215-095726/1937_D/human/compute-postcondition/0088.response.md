The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` is initially the number of '<' characters in the string `s`, after executing this line, `r` will be one less than its initial value.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1. At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is not '>'**.
