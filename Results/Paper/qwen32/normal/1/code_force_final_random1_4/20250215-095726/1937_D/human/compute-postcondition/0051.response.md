The code snippet `B.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `B`. This means that `B` will now contain all its previous elements plus the new element `0`.

Given the initial state, `B` could have been `[0]` or contained multiple elements ending with `0` if `idx_B` was not empty. After appending `0`, `B` will definitely end with `0`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` contains all its previous elements plus the new element `0`, `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<', `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`.**
