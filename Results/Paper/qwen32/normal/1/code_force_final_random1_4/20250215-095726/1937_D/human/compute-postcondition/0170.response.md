Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `a` is calculated using the formula `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. All other variables retain their initial values.
