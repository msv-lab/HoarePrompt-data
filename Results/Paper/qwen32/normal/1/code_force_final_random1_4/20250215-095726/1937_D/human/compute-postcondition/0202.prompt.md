Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is incremented by 1. Depending on the relationship between `l` and `r`, `a` and `b` are updated as follows: if `l < r`, `a` is `A[l]` and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`; if `l >= r`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`; if `l - r > 0`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`; otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i]` is not '>', then `r` is decremented by 1. Depending on the relationship between `l` and `r`, `a` and `b` are updated as follows: if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `a` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` and `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`, otherwise `b` is updated to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`; if `l` is greater than `r`, `a` is `B[r]` if `r` is 0, otherwise `a` remains unchanged; `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[-1]) * (r + 1)` if `r` is not 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`. If `s[i] == '>'`, then the following updates occur: if `l < r`, `a` is set to `A[l]` and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `(B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l >= r`, then if `r` is not 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged; `l` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] != '>'`, then `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, if `l <= r`, `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `l > r`, `a` is set to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`. If `s[i] == '>'`, the following updates occur: if `l < r`, `a` is `A[l]` and `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `x` (which is `r - (l + 2)`) is less than 0, otherwise `b` is `(B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. If `l >= r`, if `r` equals 0, no additional changes are made to `a` or `b`. Otherwise, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. `l` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] != '>'`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is not 0, and `l <= r`, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; if `r - l >= 0`, `b` is `((B[r] - B[r - l]) - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `l` is not 0 and `l > r`, `a` is set to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
