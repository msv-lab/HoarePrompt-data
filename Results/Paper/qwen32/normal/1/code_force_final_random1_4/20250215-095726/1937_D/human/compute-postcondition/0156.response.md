To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and understand how each variable contributes to the final output.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **String `s`**: 
   - Consists of '<' and '>' characters.
   - Length `n` of the string `s` is greater than 0.

2. **Indices and Computed Values**:
   - `idx_A`: List of indices where '>' appears in `s`.
   - `A`: Contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
   - `idx_B`: List of indices where '<' appears in `s`.
   - `B`: Contains computed values based on the positions of '<' in `s`.

3. **Variables**:
   - `i`: Set to `i_end + 1`.
   - `r`: Decreased by 1.
   - `a`: Set to `B[r]`.
   - `b`: Updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

Let's break down each component of the expression inside the `print` function:

- **`a * 2`**: 
  - `a` is set to `B[r]`.
  - Therefore, `a * 2` is twice the value of the element at index `r` in the list `B`.

- **`b * 2`**: 
  - `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
  - Therefore, `b * 2` is twice the value of `b` after the update.

- **`(n - i)`**: 
  - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
  - `i` is set to `i_end + 1`.
  - Therefore, `(n - i)` is the difference between the length of the string and `i`.

### Final Output Description:

Combining these components, the output of the print statement is:
- Twice the value of the element at index `r` in the list `B`.
- Plus twice the updated value of `b`.
- Plus the difference between the length of the string `s` and `i`.

Given the information, the precise output cannot be a specific number without knowing the exact values of `B[r]`, `b`, `n`, and `i`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 * B[r] + 2 * b + (n - i)**
