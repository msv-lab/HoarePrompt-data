To determine what will be printed by the `print(n - i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relationships between the variables:

1. **String `s`**: It consists of '<' and '>' characters.
2. **Length `n`**: This is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
3. **Lists `A` and `B`**: These contain computed values based on the positions of '>' and '<' in `s`, respectively.
4. **Lists `idx_A` and `idx_B`**: These contain the indices where '>' and '<' appear in `s`, respectively.
5. **Variable `i`**: This is defined as `i_end + 2`.

From the given information, we need to determine the value of `n - i`. However, the value of `i_end` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `i` is defined as `i_end + 2`, we need to infer what `i_end` could be.

Given the context, `i_end` might refer to the last index related to the computation of `A` or `B`, but without more specific details about `i_end`, we can only express the output in terms of `i_end`.

Let's assume `i_end` is some index derived from the positions of '>' or '<' in the string `s`. Therefore, `i` would be `i_end + 2`.

The expression `n - i` would then be `n - (i_end + 2)`.

Since `i_end` is not explicitly defined, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `n - i`. However, we can describe it precisely in terms of `i_end`.

Output: **n - (i_end + 2) (where n is the length of the string s and i_end is the last relevant index used in the computation of A or B)**
