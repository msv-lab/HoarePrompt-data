The code snippet initializes `idx_B` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, or `B`. The only change is the initialization of `idx_B`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` is an empty list; `idx_B` is an empty list.**
