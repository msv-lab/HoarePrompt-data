To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_end + 1`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 2`.

The variable `n` does not change throughout the loop iterations, as it represents the length of the string `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`.**
