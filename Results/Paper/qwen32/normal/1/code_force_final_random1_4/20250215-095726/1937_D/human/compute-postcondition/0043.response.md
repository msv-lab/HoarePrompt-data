Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is a list that now contains a new element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`, and `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`, `j` is `j + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `B` now includes an additional element `0`. All other variables retain their previous states and constraints.
