Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; if `s[i] == '>'`, `idx_A` is a list with one additional element `i` and `A` is a list containing one element `x`, where `x` is `(i - last_idx_A) * len(idx_A)` before appending `i`. If `s[i] != '>'`, `idx_A` and `A` remain unchanged.**
