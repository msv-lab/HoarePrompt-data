To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the expression step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

### Given Information:
- `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `i` is `i_end + 2`.
- `r` is decreased by 1 (though `r` is not used in the print statement).

### Expression Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the components of this expression:
1. **`n`**: This is the length of the string `s`.
2. **`i`**: This is defined as `i_end + 2`. The value of `i_end` is not explicitly given, but it is assumed to be some index related to the string `s`.
3. **`idx_A[l - 1]`**: This refers to the last element in the list `idx_A` if `l` is the length of `idx_A`. `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `n`**: Since `n` is the length of the string `s`, it is a known value based on the string `s`.
2. **Determine `i`**: `i` is `i_end + 2`. Without knowing `i_end`, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`, but we know it is derived from `i_end`.
3. **Determine `idx_A[l - 1]`**: This is the last index in `idx_A`, which is the position of the last '>' in the string `s`.

### Putting It All Together:
The expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` can be simplified as follows:
- Let's denote `last_idx_A` as `idx_A[l - 1]`, which is the last index of '>' in `s`.
- The expression becomes `n - i + (i - last_idx_A) * 2`.

This simplifies further to:
- `n - i + 2*i - 2*last_idx_A`
- Which is `n + i - 2*last_idx_A`

### Final Output Description:
Given the above steps, the output of the print statement will be `n + i - 2*last_idx_A`, where:
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `i` is `i_end + 2`.
- `last_idx_A` is the index of the last '>' in the string `s`.

Thus, the final output is:
Output: **n + i - 2*last_idx_A (where n is the length of the string s, i is i_end + 2, and last_idx_A is the index of the last '>' in the string s)**
