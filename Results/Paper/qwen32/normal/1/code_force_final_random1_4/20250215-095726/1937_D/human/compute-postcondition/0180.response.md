The given code snippet only modifies the variable `r` by decrementing its value by 1. None of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `r` is decreased by 1.**
