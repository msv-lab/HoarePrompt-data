The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index and `n` is the length of the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `n` does not change, it remains the length of the string `s`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; if `s[i] == '>'`, `idx_A` is a list with one additional element `i` and `A` is a list containing one element `x`, where `x` is `(i - last_idx_A) * len(idx_A)` before appending `i`. If `s[i] != '>'`, `idx_A` and `A` remain unchanged.**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; if `s[i] == '>'`, `idx_A` is a list with one additional element `i` and `A` is a list containing one element `x`, where `x` is `(i - last_idx_A) * len(idx_A)` before appending `i`. If `s[i] != '>'`, `idx_A` and `A` remain unchanged.**

For clarity, let's assume `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the last iteration. Then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**
