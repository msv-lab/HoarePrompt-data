To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `A` and `idx_A` based on the input string `s`.

### Explanation of the Loop:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using the index `i`.
- If the character `s[i]` is `'>'`, it performs the following operations:
  - Checks if `idx_A` is empty. If it is, it appends `0` to `A`.
  - Otherwise, it calculates a new value `x` based on the last element of `A`, the current index `i`, and the previous index stored in `idx_A`. This value `x` is then appended to `A`.
  - Regardless of whether `idx_A` was empty or not, the current index `i` is appended to `idx_A`.

### Given Initial State:
- `s`: a string consisting of characters `<` and `>`.
- `n`: the length of the string `s`.
- `A`: an empty list.
- `idx_A`: an empty list.

### Iteration Analysis:
Let's break down the loop iterations based on the given output states for the first 3 iterations:

1. **First Iteration (`i = 0`)**:
   - If `s[0] == '>'`, `idx_A` becomes `[0]` and `A` becomes `[0]`.

2. **Second Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
   - If `s[1] == '>'`, `idx_A` becomes `[0, 1]` and `A` becomes `[0, 1]` because `x = 0 + (1 - 0) * 1 = 1`.

3. **Third Iteration (`i = 2`)**:
   - If `s[2] == '>'`, `idx_A` becomes `[0, 1, 2]` and `A` becomes `[0, 1, 3]` because `x = 1 + (2 - 1) * 2 = 3`.

### General Pattern:
For each `'>'` encountered at index `i`, the value added to `A` is calculated as:
\[ x = A[-1] + (i - idx_A[-1]) \times \text{len}(idx_A) \]
This means that each new value in `A` depends on the previous value in `A`, the difference between the current index and the last index in `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A` at that point.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all iterations, the final state will be:
- `s`: remains unchanged.
- `n`: remains unchanged.
- `A`: contains computed values based on the positions of `'>'` in `s`.
- `idx_A`: contains all indices where `'>'` appears in `s`.

### Example Calculation:
Suppose `s = ">>><>"`:
- Iteration 1 (`i = 0`): `s[0] == '>'`, `idx_A = [0]`, `A = [0]`.
- Iteration 2 (`i = 1`): `s[1] == '>'`, `idx_A = [0, 1]`, `A = [0, 1]`.
- Iteration 3 (`i = 2`): `s[2] == '>'`, `idx_A = [0, 1, 2]`, `A = [0, 1, 3]`.
- Iteration 4 (`i = 3`): `s[3] == '<'`, no changes.
- Iteration 5 (`i = 4`): `s[4] == '>'`, `idx_A = [0, 1, 2, 4]`, `A = [0, 1, 3, 6]`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; n is the length of the string s; A contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in s; idx_A contains all indices where '>' appears in s.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `A` will contain a series of computed values based on the positions of `'>'` in the string `s`, and `idx_A` will list all the indices where `'>'` appears.
