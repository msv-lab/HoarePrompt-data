To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just the variable `i` and the range limit `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(0, n)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

The other variables mentioned (`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`) are not directly part of the loop's condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they are part of the program state and their initial values should be consistent with the problem context.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`; `i` is 0**

Since `i` is the loop variable and it is initialized automatically by the `range` function, we don't need to explicitly set it in the state description. The crucial adjustment is ensuring `n` is greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.

Final State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`**
