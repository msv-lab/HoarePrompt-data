Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both integers representing the dimensions of a field with `a` being the number of rows (N) and `b` being the number of columns (M). Both `a` and `b` must be odd integers within the range of 3 to 99 inclusive. The function returns a tuple `(x + b, y + b)`, where `b` is the number of columns (M).**
