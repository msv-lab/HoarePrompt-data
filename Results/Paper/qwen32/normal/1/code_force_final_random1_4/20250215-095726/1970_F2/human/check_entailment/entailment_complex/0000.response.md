### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The code correctly reads the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`).
   - It initializes dictionaries for players, goals, and movements.
   - It identifies the middle of the field where the Quaffle resets after a goal.
   - It reads the initial state of the field and updates the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.

2. **Processing Moves**:
   - For each move, the code correctly identifies whether the Quaffle, a player, or a Bludger is performing the action.
   - It updates the positions of the Quaffle and players according to the specified movements.
   - When a player catches the Quaffle, the code should update the `quidditch[1]` variable to indicate that the player is carrying the Quaffle. However, the current code incorrectly uses `==` instead of `=` for assignment (`quidditch[1] == mo[0]`). This is a bug.
   - When a player throws the Quaffle, the code correctly resets the `quidditch[1]` variable and checks if the Quaffle was thrown into a goal. It updates the score accordingly and resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field if necessary.
   - When a player is eliminated by the Bludger, the code correctly identifies and prints the elimination event and removes the player from the game.

3. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all moves, the code prints the final score in the required format.

### Issues Identified:
- **Bug in Catching the Quaffle**: The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player to the Quaffle carrier.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issue, the code is not entirely correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
