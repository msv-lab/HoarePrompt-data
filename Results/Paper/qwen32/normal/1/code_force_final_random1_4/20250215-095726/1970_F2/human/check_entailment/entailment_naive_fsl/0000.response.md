Correctness: **False**

Explanation: After carefully reviewing the provided code, there are several issues that suggest the program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Quaffle Catching**: The code uses `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` instead of `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` when a player catches the Quaffle. This means the Quaffle is not actually being assigned to the player who caught it.

2. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic**: The code checks if the player's position is in the goals for both teams (`if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']` and `if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']`). However, it does not ensure that the player is scoring in the opposing team's goal. For example, if a red player is in a red goal, the blue team should score, not the red team.

3. **Incorrect Quaffle Position Reset**: When a player scores, the Quaffle should always move to the middle of the field. However, the code incorrectly resets the Quaffle to the player's position if the player scored in their own goal.

Here is a specific example to illustrate these issues:

### Example Input:
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
6
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
R0 T
```

### Expected Output:
```
3 BLUE GOAL
5 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1
```

### Actual Output:
```
3 BLUE GOAL
5 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 2 2
```

### Explanation of the Issue:
- In the 5th step, the red player `R0` throws the Quaffle into their own goal `RG`. According to the rules, the blue team should score. However, the code incorrectly increments the red team's score because it does not check if the player is scoring in their own goal.
- The Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field after each goal, regardless of which team scores. The code does not handle this correctly.

These issues demonstrate that the program does not fully comply with the problem description and fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
