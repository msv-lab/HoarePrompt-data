You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players. It returns a list of integers where each integer is either -1 (indicating an invalid configuration) or a non-negative integer representing the number of matches that ended in a draw for the corresponding test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to ensure it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis:

The program is supposed to calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players in chess games. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Total Points Check**: The program first checks if the total points are even. If not, it returns `-1` because points are awarded in pairs (2 for a win, 1+1 for a draw).
2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The total number of matches is calculated by dividing the total points by 2.
3. **Constraints Check**: The program checks if the total matches exceed 3 (since there are only 3 players, the maximum number of unique matches is 3) and if the highest score (`p3`) exceeds the total matches.
4. **Draws Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws is `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If this value is negative, it returns `-1`; otherwise, it divides this value by 2 to get the number of draws.

### Issues Identified:

- **Incorrect Total Matches Constraint**: The condition `if total_matchs > 3` is incorrect. The maximum number of matches among 3 players is not limited to 3; it can be more depending on how many games they played. For example, if all three players played against each other multiple times, the total number of matches can be greater than 3.
- **Incorrect Draws Calculation Formula**: The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` seems incorrect and does not correctly account for all possible scenarios of wins and draws.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 2`, `p3 = 4`
- Expected Output: `2` (This can be achieved with 2 wins for player 3 and 2 draws among players 1 and 2)
- Actual Output: The program will likely output `-1` due to the incorrect constraints and formula.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly limits the total number of matches to 3 and uses an incorrect formula to calculate the number of draws, leading to incorrect results for certain valid inputs.
