Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total points across all three players using `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - Since each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw), the total points must be even. If not, the program correctly returns `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches played using `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - This is because each match contributes 2 points, so dividing the total points by 2 gives the total number of matches.

3. **Constraints Check**:
   - The program checks if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`. 
     - `total_matchs > 3`: This constraint seems incorrect because there can be more than 3 matches if the players played multiple games against each other. Thus, this check should be removed.
     - `p3 > total_matchs`: This is a valid check because the highest score `p3` cannot exceed the total number of matches played.

4. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
     - This formula attempts to account for the points contributed by wins and losses, and then subtracts those from the total points to find the points contributed by draws.
     - However, the formula does not correctly account for all scenarios, especially when multiple games are played between the same pairs of players.

5. **Final Validation**:
   - The program checks if `egalites < 0`. If so, it returns `-1` because the calculated number of draws is invalid.
   - Otherwise, it returns `egalites // 2` as the number of draws.

### Issues Identified:
- The constraint `total_matchs > 3` is incorrect and should be removed.
- The formula for calculating `egalites` does not correctly handle all scenarios, especially when multiple games are played between the same pairs of players.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the identified issues, particularly the incorrect constraint and the flawed formula for calculating draws, the program is not entirely correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
