The only variables in the loop head are `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, which are unpacked from the tuples in `cas_de_test`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, and we have just processed the first tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least another tuple in `cas_de_test`.

Let's denote the next tuple in `cas_de_test` as `(next_p1, next_p2, next_p3)`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` should be set to these values for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `total_points` is the sum of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` contains `-1`. Otherwise, if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p_3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing two elements, both `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the single element `-1` if `total_points` is odd, or an empty list if `total_points` is even, and now includes an additional element `egalites // 2`.**

To be more specific:
- `p1` is `next_p1`
- `p2` is `next_p2`
- `p3` is `next_p3`

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `next_p1 + next_p2 + next_p3`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (next_p3 - next_p2) - 2 * (next_p3 - next_p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` contains `-1`. Otherwise, if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `next_p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing two elements, both `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the single element `-1` if `total_points` is odd, or an empty list if `total_points` is even, and now includes an additional element `egalites // 2`.**
