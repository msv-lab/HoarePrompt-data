Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and cas_de_test is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players in each test case; resultats is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `resultats` is initialized as an empty list. All other variables (`t` and `cas_de_test`) retain their initial values as no changes are made to them in the given code snippet.
