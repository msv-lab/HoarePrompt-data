Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `total_matchs` is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`; `egalites` is recalculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`; `resultats` now includes `egalites // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `resultats` has been updated to include the value of `egalites // 2`. All other variables retain their previous values and constraints.
