The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables or affect the flow of the program in a way that modifies the existing state. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration.

Given that no changes occur to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `resultats` is a list containing the single element `-1`, `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, and `total_points` is odd.**
