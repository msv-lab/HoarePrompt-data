The code calculates the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and assigns it to `total_points`. The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `next_p1`, `next_p2`, and `next_p3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`.**
