The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `pow` by 2. Given the initial state, `pow` is initially set to 2. After executing the code, `pow` will be updated to 4.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, and `tot`) remain unchanged by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is 1; `k` is an integer; `L` is [1]; `pow` is 4; `tot` is `tot + a`.**
