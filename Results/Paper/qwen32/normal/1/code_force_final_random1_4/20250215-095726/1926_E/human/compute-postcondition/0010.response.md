The code snippet `n -= m` reduces the value of `n` by `m`. Given that `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `n` was originally greater than 1.
- `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- After executing `n -= m`, the new value of `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is an integer; `L` is a list containing `((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
