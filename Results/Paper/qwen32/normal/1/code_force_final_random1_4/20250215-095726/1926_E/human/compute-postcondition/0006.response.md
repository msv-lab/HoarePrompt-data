The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. Given that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is a non-zero integer updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is an integer; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
