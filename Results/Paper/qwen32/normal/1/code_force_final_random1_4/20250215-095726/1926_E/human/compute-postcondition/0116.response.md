The code snippet assigns the value of `k - g` to the variable `f`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`) are modified by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `s` is the accumulated sum until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches `k`, `i` is the number of iterations the loop ran, `d` is 0, `h` is \(\left(h_{\text{initial}} - (2^{i-1} - 1)\right) / 2^{i-1}\), `p` is `i`, `g` is \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-2} \left(\left(h_{\text{initial}} - (2^j - 1)\right) / 2^j\right)\), `f` is `k - g`.**
