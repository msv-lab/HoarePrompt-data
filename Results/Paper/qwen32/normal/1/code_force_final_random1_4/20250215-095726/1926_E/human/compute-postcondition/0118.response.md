Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `s` is the accumulated sum until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches `k`.
- `i` is the number of iterations the loop ran.
- `d` is 0.
- `h` is \(\left(h_{\text{initial}} - (2^{i-1} - 1)\right) / 2^{i-1}\).
- `p` is `i`.
- `g` is \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-2} \left(\left(h_{\text{initial}} - (2^j - 1)\right) / 2^j\right)\).
- `f` is `k - g`.
- `y` is \(2\).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(y)
```

### Analysis:
From the initial state, we see that `y` is explicitly defined as \(2\). There are no conditions or loops that modify `y` before the print statement is executed.

### Conclusion:
The variable `y` is directly assigned the value \(2\). Therefore, the print statement will output this value.

Output: **2**
