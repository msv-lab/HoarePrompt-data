The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Given that the initial value of `pow` is 4, after executing the code, `pow` becomes 8. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` remains 3, `n` is 0, `k` remains the second integer from the input, `L` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `pow` is 8, `m` is 1, and `tot` is 3, `a` is 1. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the conditions on the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions on the variables remain unchanged as well.**
