The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by these new values.

Output State: **`t` is 3; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `L` is [3, 1, 1]; `tot` is 5; `pow` is 8; `m` is 1**
This means that the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the integers provided in the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
