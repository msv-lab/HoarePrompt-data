The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. However, since `m` was already initialized with the same value `(n + 1) // 2` in the initial state, the value of `m` does not change after the execution of the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State except for the explicit reassignment which does not alter the value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is an integer; `L` is a list containing `((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
