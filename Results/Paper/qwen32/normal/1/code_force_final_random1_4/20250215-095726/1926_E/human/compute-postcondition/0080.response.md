Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state:

Initial State: 
- `t` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2]`
- `tot` is 5
- `pow` is 8
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

Code Snippet:
```python
n -= m
```

Impact:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - m`.

Since `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be:
\[ n_{\text{new}} = n - \frac{n + 1}{2} = \frac{2n - (n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n - 1}{2} \]

Therefore, the new value of `n` is `(n - 1) // 2`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 3; `n` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `k` is the second integer from the input; `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2]`; `tot` is 5; `pow` is 8; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
