The given code snippet modifies the value of `pow` by multiplying it by 2. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code.

Given:
- `pow` is initially 4.
- After executing `pow *= 2`, `pow` becomes 8.

No other variables are modified by this code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 1, `k` is an integer, `L` is [1, 2], `pow` is 8, `tot` is `tot + 2 * a`, `a` is 2. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the conditions remain as stated. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged as specified in the precondition.**
