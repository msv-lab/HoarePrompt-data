To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates and what happens when it completes all iterations without breaking.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over odd indices from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2 (i.e., `i` takes values 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the largest odd number less than `n`).
- For each iteration, it checks if either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. If either condition is met, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints "Yes".

### Conditions for Completion:
- The loop will complete all iterations if none of the conditions inside the loop are met during any iteration.
- This means for every odd `i` from 1 to `n-1`, neither `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` nor `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` should hold true.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop completes all iterations, the final output will be "Yes".
- If the loop breaks at any point, the final output will be "No".

Since the problem specifies the output states after the first three iterations and does not indicate that the loop broke, we assume that the loop did not break during these iterations. Therefore, we continue this assumption to conclude that the loop completes all its iterations.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **Yes**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the program will print "Yes" if none of the specified conditions were met during any iteration.
