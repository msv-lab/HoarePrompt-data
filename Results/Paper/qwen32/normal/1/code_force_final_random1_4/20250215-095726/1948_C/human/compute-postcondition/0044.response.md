Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is the new string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user, and either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` and both are equal to `<` with `i + 1` being less than `n`, or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` and both are equal to `<`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the condition involving `a[i]` and `b[i]` or `b[i+1]` still holds true. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
