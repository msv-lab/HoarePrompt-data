Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is at least 7, `a` is the new string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user, `i` is 7 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. We exit the most internal loop or if statement without modifying any of these variables.
