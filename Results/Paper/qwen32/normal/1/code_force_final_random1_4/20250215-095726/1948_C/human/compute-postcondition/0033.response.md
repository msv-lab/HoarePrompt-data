Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is decremented by 1 (This means `t = t - 1`, but the new value of `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is greater than 1 (This provides a condition about `n`, but it is not used in the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are strings input by the user (These strings are not used in the print statement).
- `i` is `i + 2` (This means `i` is incremented by 2, but the new value of `i` is not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement directly outputs the string `'No'`. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `i` are used within this print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will simply output the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
