Postcondition: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is the new string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user, `i` is 5. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
