Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user, and the loop prints "Yes".
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
        print('No')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is the new string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` and both are equal to `<` with `i + 1` being less than `n`, or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` and both are equal to `<`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is the new string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user, `i` is 5. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is at least 7, `a` is the new string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user, and `i` is 7. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
