### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

#### Key Points:
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It moves in two steps: a free move (up, down, left, right) followed by a forced move according to the arrow in the new cell.
- We need to check if the robot can reach (2, n).

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The code iterates through each test case and checks the conditions for every second column starting from the second column (i.e., columns 2, 4, 6, ...). It specifically checks if there are two consecutive '<' arrows in the same row or across rows at these positions. If such a pattern is found, it prints "No", indicating that the robot cannot reach (2, n).

However, this approach is flawed because:
1. It only checks for specific patterns of '<' arrows in certain columns.
2. It does not account for all possible paths the robot can take.
3. It does not consider the possibility of the robot moving up or down to switch rows.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we should simulate the robot's movement step-by-step and check if it can reach (2, n). This involves:
- Starting at (1, 1).
- Moving to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, right).
- Following the arrow in the new cell.
- Repeating until the robot reaches (2, n) or it becomes clear that it cannot.

Since the provided code does not implement this logic and only checks for specific patterns, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the problem description and the given examples.

Correctness: **False**
