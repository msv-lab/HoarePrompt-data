Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a game on an `n x n` chessboard where players place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other. The player starts by placing a white rook, and the computer mirrors this move by placing a black rook at the mirrored position `(c, r)` unless `r == c`, in which case the computer skips its turn. Given `k` initial moves, the task is to find the number of possible final configurations of the board after all valid moves are exhausted.

### Key Points

1. **Mirroring Moves**: Each player's move is mirrored by the computer unless the move is on the diagonal (`r == c`).
2. **Final Configurations**: We need to count all possible configurations of the board after all valid moves.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The result should be printed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of possible configurations for a given board size `n` and number of moves `k`. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**:
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to fill an `i x i` board after all valid moves.
   - Base cases: `dp[1] = 1` (only one way to place a rook on a `1x1` board) and `dp[2] = 3` (three ways to place rooks on a `2x2` board).

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For `i >= 3`, the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.
   - This relation considers placing a rook in the last row/column and then recursively solving for the remaining board.

3. **Precomputation**:
   - The function `func_1` precomputes the values of `dp` up to `300000` to handle the maximum possible value of `n`.

4. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the solution reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves and marks the corresponding rows and columns as invalid.
   - The number of valid positions left is `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The result for each test case is `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

### Issues in the Provided Solution

1. **Invalid Set Usage**:
   - The code uses a set `invalid` to track rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - However, it incorrectly adds both `r` and `c` to the set for each move, which means it counts diagonal moves twice.
   - This leads to an incorrect calculation of the number of valid positions left.

2. **Handling Diagonal Moves**:
   - The code does not correctly handle diagonal moves where `r == c`.
   - When `r == c`, the computer skips its turn, but the current implementation does not account for this correctly.

3. **Initialization of `dp`**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `-1`, but it should be initialized with `0` for indices that are not explicitly set by the base cases or the recurrence relation.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the solution, particularly the incorrect handling of invalid positions and diagonal moves, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
