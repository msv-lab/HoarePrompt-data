### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by precomputing the number of possible final configurations for a given size of the chessboard \( n \) using dynamic programming. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly addresses the problem:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The `func_1` function initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to fill an \( i \times i \) chessboard under the given rules.
   - The base cases are set as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This relation seems to correctly account for the number of ways to place rooks on the board while respecting the constraints.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the size of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves and marks the rows and columns affected by these moves as "invalid" by adding them to a set called `invalid`.
   - The number of available positions left on the board is calculated as `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The program then prints `dp[n - len(invalid)]` as the result for that test case, ensuring that the result is at least 1 (using `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`).

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The dynamic programming approach is sound and correctly computes the number of configurations for an empty board of size \( n \).
   - The marking of invalid rows and columns ensures that the remaining positions are correctly accounted for.
   - The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) ensures that the results do not overflow.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. It efficiently computes the required values using dynamic programming and handles the constraints appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
