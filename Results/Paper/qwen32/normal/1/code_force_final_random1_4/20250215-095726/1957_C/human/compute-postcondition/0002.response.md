To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the for loop is:

```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`, but since `i` is the loop variable and is initialized by the `range` function, we cannot directly adjust `i` before the loop starts. Instead, we need to ensure that the range function allows the loop to execute as intended.

The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 because the range `range(3, n + 1)` will generate values starting from 3 up to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, the critical variable to adjust is `n`.

Given the problem constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `dp[1]` is 1; `dp[2]` is 3.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 3. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`) are either constants or do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
