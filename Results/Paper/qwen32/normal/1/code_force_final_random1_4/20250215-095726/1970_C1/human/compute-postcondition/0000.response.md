The given Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state provides information about the tree structure and the position of a stone, but these details are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Given the code:
```python
x, y = map(int, input().split())
```

This line of code will take an input consisting of two space-separated integers, convert them to integers, and assign them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `n`, `t`, the tree structure, and `u_1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.**
