The code snippet `tmp = z` assigns the value of `z` to the variable `tmp`. The previous value of `tmp` (which was the last node visited) is replaced by the value of `z`. The variables `one` and `two` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tmp` is `z`, `one` is either `True` or `False`, `two` is `True`.**
