Output State: **`current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue` and `tree[current]` contains at least one more neighbor that has not been processed as `neighbor`. `neighbor` is added to `visited`. `neighbor` is the next unprocessed neighbor in `tree[current]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `visited` now includes the `neighbor` node. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
