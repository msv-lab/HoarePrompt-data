To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```
while rev[tmp] != []:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `rev[tmp]` is not an empty list. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `rev[tmp]` must not be an empty list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `tmp` is the last element of `rev[tmp]` before the pop operation.
- `rev[tmp]` is a list with one less element than before.
- `one` is either `True` or `False`.
- `two` is `True`.
- `rev[z]` is a list with one less element than before.

From this information, we know that `rev[tmp]` had at least one element before the pop operation, but now it has one less element. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `rev[tmp]` must still have at least one element left.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
1. Ensure `rev[tmp]` is not an empty list. Since `rev[tmp]` had one element removed, we need to add back at least one element to `rev[tmp]`.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`tmp` is the last element of `rev[tmp]` before the pop operation; `rev[tmp]` is a list with at least one element (add back an element to `rev[tmp]`); `one` is either `True` or `False`; `two` is `True`; `rev[z]` is a list with one less element than before.**

Since the exact elements of `rev[tmp]` are not specified, we just need to ensure it is not empty. We can represent this by stating that `rev[tmp]` should have at least one element.

Final Answer:
State: **`tmp` is the last element of `rev[tmp]` before the pop operation; `rev[tmp]` is a list with at least one element; `one` is either `True` or `False`; `two` is `True`; `rev[z]` is a list with one less element than before.**
