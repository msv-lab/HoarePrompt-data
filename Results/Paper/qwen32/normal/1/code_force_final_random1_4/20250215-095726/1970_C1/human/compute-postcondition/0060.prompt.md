You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, target is an integer representing the target node in the tree, tree is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, where each key/index corresponds to a node and its value is a list of its neighbors.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: the function returns the shortest distance from start to target.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `bfs` accepts three parameters: `start`, which is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS; `target`, which is an integer representing the target node in the tree; and `tree`, which is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree. The function performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. It returns the distance (`dist`) from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `start` node is the same as the `target` node, it returns `dist` which is 0. If the `target` node is found during the BFS, it returns `dist`, which is the distance associated with the `target` node. If the `target` node is not reachable from the `start` node, it returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns dist which is 0.

Case_2: The program returns `dist`, which is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `queue`.

Case_3: The program returns `dist` which holds the distance associated with `current`.

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
