The code snippet `two = not two` flips the boolean value of the variable `two`. Given that the initial state specifies `two` is `False`, executing this line will change `two` to `True`.

Other variables (`tmp`, `one`, `rev[z]`, and `rev[tmp]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`tmp` is the last element of `rev[z]` and `rev[tmp]` is a non-empty list; `one` is either `True` or `False`; `two` is `True`; `rev[z]` is a list with one less element than before.**
