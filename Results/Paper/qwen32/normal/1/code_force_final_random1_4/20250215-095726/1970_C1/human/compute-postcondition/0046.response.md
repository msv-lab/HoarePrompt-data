Output State: **`current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue` and `tree[current]` contains at least one neighbor. Additionally, `neighbor` is in `visited`. The `queue` now includes the tuple `((neighbor, dist + 1))`.**

In simple terms, the `queue` has been updated to include a new tuple consisting of `neighbor` and `dist + 1`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
