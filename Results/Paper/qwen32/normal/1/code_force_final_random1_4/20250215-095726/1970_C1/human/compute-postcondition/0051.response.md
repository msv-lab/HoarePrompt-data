Postcondition: **`current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue` and `tree[current]` contains at least one more neighbor that has not been processed as `neighbor`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `visited` includes `neighbor` and `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.**
