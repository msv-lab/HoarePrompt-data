The code snippet provided appends the integer `b` to the list associated with the key `a` in the `defaultdict` named `lst`. This means that `lst[a]` will now include `b` as one of its elements.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the `lst` dictionary. The values of `n`, `t`, `u_1`, `x`, `y`, `rev`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where `lst[a]` now contains `b` appended to its list. `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` now includes `a` appended to its list. `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
