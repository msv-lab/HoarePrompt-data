The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input provided. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `u_1`, `x`, `y`, `lst`, `rev`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory. `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory. `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
