The code snippet `two = not two` flips the boolean value of the variable `two`. Given that the initial state specifies `two` is `True`, after executing the code, `two` will become `False`.

The other variables (`tmp`, `rev[tmp]`, `one`, `rev[z]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`tmp` is the last element of `rev[tmp]` before the pop operation; `rev[tmp]` is a list with at least one element; `one` is either `True` or `False`; `two` is `False`; `rev[z]` is a list with one less element than before.**
