The code `tmp = rev[tmp].pop()` removes the last element from the list `rev[tmp]` and assigns this element to `tmp`. Given the initial state, `tmp` was initially the last element of `rev[tmp]` before the pop operation, and `rev[tmp]` had at least one element. After the pop operation, `rev[tmp]` will have one less element.

Since `tmp` is reassigned to the last element of `rev[tmp]` that was just popped, the new value of `tmp` is the second-to-last element of the original `rev[tmp]`.

The other variables (`one`, `two`, and `rev[z]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tmp` is the second-to-last element of the original `rev[tmp]`; `rev[tmp]` is a list with one less element than before; `one` is either `True` or `False`; `two` is `False`; `rev[z]` is a list with one less element than before.**
