Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where `lst[a]` contains all `b` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations. `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` includes all `a` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations. `z` is an integer read from the input. `tmp` is assigned the value of `z`. `one` is True.
Code of the loop:
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where `lst[a]` contains all `b` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations, and `lst[z]` contains at least one element (e.g., `[1]`) except the last element which has been popped. `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` includes all `a` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations. `z` is an integer read from the input. `tmp` is assigned the value of the last element of `lst[z]` that was popped. `one` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where `lst[a]` contains all `b` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations, and `lst[z]` contains at least one element (e.g., `[1]`). `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` includes all `a` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations. `z` is an integer read from the input. `tmp` is assigned the value of the last element of `lst[tmp]` that was popped. `one` is True. Additionally, `lst[tmp]` is not empty unless it became empty due to the pop operation.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where `lst[a]` contains all `b` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations, and `lst[z]` contains at least one element (e.g., `[1]`). `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` includes all `a` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations. `z` is an integer read from the input. `tmp` is assigned the value of the last element of `lst[tmp]` that was popped, and `lst[tmp]` has one less element than before. `one` is False.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
