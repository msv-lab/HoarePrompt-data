Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, where each key/index corresponds to a node and its value is a list of its neighbors, `queue` is a deque containing one tuple `((start, 0))`, `visited` is a set containing the `start` node.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS; `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree; `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `queue` contains tuples `(neighbor, 1)` for each neighbor of `start` that was not in `visited`; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node and all its neighbors; `current` is `start`; `dist` is `0`; `current` is not equal to `target`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all nodes reachable from `start`, and the function returns `dist` which is the shortest distance from `start` to `target`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The queue is empty, all reachable nodes are in the visited set, the current variable holds the last processed node, and the dist variable holds the distance of the last processed node from the start node.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
