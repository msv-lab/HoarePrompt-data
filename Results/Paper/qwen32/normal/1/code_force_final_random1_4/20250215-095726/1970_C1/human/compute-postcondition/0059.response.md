Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts three parameters: `start`, which is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS; `target`, which is an integer representing the target node in the tree; and `tree`, which is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree. The function performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. It returns the distance (`dist`) from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `start` node is the same as the `target` node, it returns `dist` which is 0. If the `target` node is found during the BFS, it returns `dist`, which is the distance associated with the `target` node. If the `target` node is not reachable from the `start` node, it returns -1.**
