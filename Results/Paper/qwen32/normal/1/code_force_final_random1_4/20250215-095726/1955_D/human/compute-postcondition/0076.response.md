To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved:

- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive). This likely represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it doesn't directly affect the value of `ans` in this specific context.
- `n`, `k`: Integers read from the input. `n` could represent the length of lists `a` and `b`, while `k` is a threshold value used in the comparison.
- `a`, `b`: Lists of integers read from the input.
- `m`: An integer greater than or equal to 1. It defines a sliding window size over the list `a`.
- `b_values`: A set of unique elements from the list `b`.
- `cnt_b`: A dictionary (or similar structure) that keeps track of the counts of elements in `b` as the sliding window moves over `a`.
- `curr`: The number of elements in the current window of `a` (from index `n - m` to `n - 1`) that are also in `b` and have a positive count in `cnt_b`.
- `ans`: The total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

Given this setup, `ans` is incremented every time the number of elements in the current window of `a` that are also in `b` (and have a positive count in `cnt_b`) meets or exceeds the threshold `k`.

When the `print(ans)` statement is executed, it will output the final value of `ans` after all iterations of the loop.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of times the number of elements in the current window of a that are also in b and have a positive count in cnt_b is greater than or equal to k)**
