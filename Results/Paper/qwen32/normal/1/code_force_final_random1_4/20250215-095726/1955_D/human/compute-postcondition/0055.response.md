Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is the number of elements in `a` (up to the first `m` elements) that were also in `b` and had a positive count in `cnt_b` after the loop minus 1; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `curr` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state descriptions.
