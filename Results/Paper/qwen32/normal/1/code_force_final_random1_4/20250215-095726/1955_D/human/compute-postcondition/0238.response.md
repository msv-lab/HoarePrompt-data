Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

- `i` is `m + 2`
- `n` is greater than `m + 2`
- If `a[m + 2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` becomes greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1.
- `cnt_b[a[2m + 2]]` is decreased by 1.
- Regardless of whether `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` or not, `curr` is increased by 1.
- `ans` is incremented by 1.

The code snippet provided is simply `ans += 1`. This means that the value of `ans` will increase by 1. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`) are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
