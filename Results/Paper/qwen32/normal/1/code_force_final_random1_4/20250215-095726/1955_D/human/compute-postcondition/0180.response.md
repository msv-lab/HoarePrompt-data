The code snippet only initializes a new variable `curr` with the value `0`. It does not affect any of the existing variables (`i`, `cnt_b[b[i]]`, `b_values`, `ans`). Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `curr` with the value `0`.

Output State: **`i` is `m-1`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `0` to `m-1`; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0.**
