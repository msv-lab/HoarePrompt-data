The code creates a set named `b_values` that contains unique elements from the list `b`. The initial state indicates that `i` is `m-1` and `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented for each `i` from `0` to `m-1`. However, these details about `i` and `cnt_b` are not affected by the new line of code that creates `b_values`.

Output State: **`i` is `m-1`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `0` to `m-1`; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`.**
