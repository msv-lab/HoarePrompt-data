Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` after all iterations except the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`; `a[i]` may or may not be in `b_values`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and its count in `cnt_b` is non-negative, then `curr` is 1; otherwise, `curr` remains 0. `ans` is 0.**
