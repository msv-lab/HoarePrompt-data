The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m + 1`, and `n` is greater than `m + 1`.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `m + 2`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n - m`. Since `i` is now `m + 2`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2` for the loop to execute again.

No other variables in the loop head (`n`) need to be changed other than ensuring it satisfies the condition for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`**
