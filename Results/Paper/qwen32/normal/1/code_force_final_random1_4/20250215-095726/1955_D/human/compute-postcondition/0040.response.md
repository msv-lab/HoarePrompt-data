Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` with the count of each `a[i]` (for `i` from `0` to `m-1`) decreased by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and now increased by 1 for `a[i]`; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; `curr` is the number of elements in `a` (up to the first `m` elements) that were also in `b` and had a positive count in `cnt_b` after the loop; `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0.**
