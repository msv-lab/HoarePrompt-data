The given code snippet decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. Based on the initial state provided, `i` is `m + 1`, so `i + m` evaluates to `2m + 1`.

Here's the impact of the code on the program:
- `cnt_b[a[2m + 1]]` is decremented by 1.

Other variables (`i`, `n`, `a[i]`, `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]`, `curr`) remain unchanged unless their values are directly affected by the operation. Since the operation only modifies `cnt_b[a[2m + 1]]`, no other variables are impacted.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than `m + 1`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. `cnt_b[a[2m + 1]]` is decremented by 1.**
