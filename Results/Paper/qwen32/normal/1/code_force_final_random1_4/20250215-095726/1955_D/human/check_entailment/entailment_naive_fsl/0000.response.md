Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the program does not reset the `cnt_b` array properly between test cases, which can cause carry-over effects from one test case to another.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization of `cnt_b`**: The `cnt_b` array is initialized outside the loop that processes each test case. This means that the counts from previous test cases will still be present when processing the next test case unless explicitly reset.

2. **Resetting `cnt_b`**: After processing each test case, the program attempts to reset `cnt_b` by setting `cnt_b[i] = 0` for each `i` in `b_values`. However, this only resets the counts for the values that were present in the current test case's `b` array. If `b` arrays across different test cases contain different values, the counts for values not present in the current `b` array will remain unchanged from the previous test case.

3. **Potential Issue**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   2
   5 3 2
   1 2 3 4 5
   1 2 3
   5 3 2
   1 2 3 4 5
   3 4 5
   ```
   In the first test case, `cnt_b` will be `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ...]` after processing `b = [1, 2, 3]`. In the second test case, the program will only reset the counts for `3`, `4`, and `5`, leaving the counts for `1` and `2` unchanged. This can lead to incorrect results because the program might incorrectly assume that `1` and `2` are still present in the `b` array of the second test case.

To fix this issue, the `cnt_b` array should be fully reset to zeros at the beginning of each test case, rather than just resetting the counts for the values present in the current `b` array. Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func():
    max_val = 1000000
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)  # Reset cnt_b at the beginning of each test case
        for i in range(m):
            cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
        b_values = set(b)
        ans = 0
        curr = 0
        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

By resetting `cnt_b` at the beginning of each test case, we ensure that the counts are accurate for each individual test case, thus avoiding any carry-over issues.
