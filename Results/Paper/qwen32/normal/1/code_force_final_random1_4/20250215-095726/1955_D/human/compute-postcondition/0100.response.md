Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` after all iterations; `curr` is 0; `ans` is 0; `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
