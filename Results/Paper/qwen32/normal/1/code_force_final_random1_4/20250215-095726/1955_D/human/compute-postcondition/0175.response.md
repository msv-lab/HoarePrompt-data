The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2.

The state of `cnt_b[b[1]]` being incremented by 1 does not affect the loop's continuation as it is not part of the loop head.

State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2**
