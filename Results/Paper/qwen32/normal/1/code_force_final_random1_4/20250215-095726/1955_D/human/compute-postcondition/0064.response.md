The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` to prepare for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n - m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, we simply need to increment `i` by 1 again.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `x`.
- The loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `m`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. `curr` is the number of elements in `a` (up to the first `m` elements) that were also in `b` and had a positive count in `cnt_b` after the loop. `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b`, `curr`, or `ans`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1. `i` is now `x + 1`**.

To generalize this, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

So, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`. `i` is incremented by 1. `i` is now `i + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can express the state as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`. `i` is incremented by 1**.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`. `i` is incremented by 1**.
