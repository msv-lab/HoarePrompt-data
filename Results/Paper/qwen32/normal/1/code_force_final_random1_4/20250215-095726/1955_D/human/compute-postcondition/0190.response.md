The value of `curr` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `m`, and `cnt_b[a[1]]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decreased by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decreased by 1, `curr` is increased by 1**.
