The code snippet decrements the value of `curr` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` and `curr` are integers, `n` must be greater than `m`, the current value of `a[i]` is in the set of `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0; `curr` is decreased by 1.**
