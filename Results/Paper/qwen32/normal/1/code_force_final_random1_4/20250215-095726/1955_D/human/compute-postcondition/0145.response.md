Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`) retain their previous values and conditions.
