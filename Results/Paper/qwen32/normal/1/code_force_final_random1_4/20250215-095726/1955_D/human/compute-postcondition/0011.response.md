The given code snippet increments the count of the element at index `i` in list `b` within the dictionary `cnt_b`. Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value at index `i` in list `b` is used as a key in the dictionary `cnt_b`, and its corresponding value (count) is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
