To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in b_values:
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know from the provided state that:
- `i` is the next element in `b_values` after `n - m`.
- `curr` reflects the net effect of the increments and decrements based on the elements in `a` and their presence in `b_values`.
- `ans` reflects how many times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.
- `b_values` must contain at least one element.
- `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

Since `i` is the variable being iterated over in `b_values`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be updated to the next element in `b_values`.

Let's denote the current value of `i` as `b_values[j]`, where `j` is the current index in `b_values`. After the current iteration, `i` would be `b_values[j + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values` after the current `i`, `curr` reflects the net effect of the increments and decrements based on the elements in `a` and their presence in `b_values`, `ans` reflects how many times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `b_values` must contain at least one element, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**.

To make it more precise, if the current `i` is `b_values[j]`, then the next `i` should be `b_values[j + 1]`.

State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values` after the current `i`, `curr` reflects the net effect of the increments and decrements based on the elements in `a` and their presence in `b_values`, `ans` reflects how many times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `b_values` must contain at least one element, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `j`, we can simply say:

State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values`, `curr` reflects the net effect of the increments and decrements based on the elements in `a` and their presence in `b_values`, `ans` reflects how many times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `b_values` must contain at least one element, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**.
