The code snippet increments the variable `curr` by 1. The values of `i`, `m`, `a[0]`, `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[0]]` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `curr`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a[0]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1.**
