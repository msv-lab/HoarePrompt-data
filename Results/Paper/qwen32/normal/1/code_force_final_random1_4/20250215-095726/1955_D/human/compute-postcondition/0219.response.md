The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the dictionary `cnt_b`. Given that `i` is `m + 1`, the element at `a[m + 1]` is being counted.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the count of the element `a[m + 1]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` has been increased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
