You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` iterations of the loop have been executed. For each iteration, `cnt_b` is reset to 0 for all elements in `b_values`. The variable `ans` holds the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` across all iterations. The variable `curr` reflects the final count of elements in `a` that were found in `b_values` and had a non-negative count in `cnt_b` for the last processed window of size `m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the program does not reset the `cnt_b` array properly between test cases, which can cause carry-over effects from one test case to another.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization of `cnt_b`**: The `cnt_b` array is initialized outside the loop that processes each test case. This means that the counts from previous test cases will still be present when processing the next test case unless explicitly reset.

2. **Resetting `cnt_b`**: After processing each test case, the program attempts to reset `cnt_b` by setting `cnt_b[i] = 0` for each `i` in `b_values`. However, this only resets the counts for the values that were present in the current test case's `b` array. If `b` arrays across different test cases contain different values, the counts for values not present in the current `b` array will remain unchanged from the previous test case.

3. **Potential Issue**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   2
   5 3 2
   1 2 3 4 5
   1 2 3
   5 3 2
   1 2 3 4 5
   3 4 5
   ```
   In the first test case, `cnt_b` will be `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ...]` after processing `b = [1, 2, 3]`. In the second test case, the program will only reset the counts for `3`, `4`, and `5`, leaving the counts for `1` and `2` unchanged. This can lead to incorrect results because the program might incorrectly assume that `1` and `2` are still present in the `b` array of the second test case.

To fix this issue, the `cnt_b` array should be fully reset to zeros at the beginning of each test case, rather than just resetting the counts for the values present in the current `b` array. Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func():
    max_val = 1000000
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)  # Reset cnt_b at the beginning of each test case
        for i in range(m):
            cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
        b_values = set(b)
        ans = 0
        curr = 0
        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

By resetting `cnt_b` at the beginning of each test case, we ensure that the counts are accurate for each individual test case, thus avoiding any carry-over issues.
