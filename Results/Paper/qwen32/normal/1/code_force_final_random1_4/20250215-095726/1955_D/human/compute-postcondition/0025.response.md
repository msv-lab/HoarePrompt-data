The code snippet `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `curr` was either 0 or 1. After executing the code, `curr` will be either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` with the count of `a[m]` decreased by 1 if `a[m]` is in `b_values`; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is either 1 or 2; `i` is `m`.**
