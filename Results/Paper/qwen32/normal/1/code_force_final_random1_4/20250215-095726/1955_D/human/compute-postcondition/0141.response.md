The given code snippet modifies the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by decrementing it by 1. This affects the count of the element `a[i + m]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. No other variables are explicitly modified in the provided code snippet.

Given the initial state, `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The relationship `n > m` also remains valid. The value of `i` is not changed by this code snippet because it only uses `i + m` to index into the array `a`.

The only change is in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Specifically, the count of the element `a[i + m]` is decreased by 1. If this count becomes zero or negative, it implies that the element `a[i + m]` is no longer considered in the current context of `cnt_b`.

Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was the value at the end of the last iteration). If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` becomes greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.**
