Postcondition: **`t` and `curr` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`. The current value of `a[i + m]` is in the set of `b_values`. If the current value of `a[i + m]` is in the set of `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1.**
