The code snippet `curr -= 1` decrements the value of `curr` by 1. No other variables in the given initial state are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is greater than `m`, `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[m]]` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `cnt_b[a[m]]` is greater than 0; `curr` is decreased by 1.**
