Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. The program's current implementation focuses on extracting and sorting unique characters from the encoded string `b` and then returning these characters in reverse order, but it does not map these characters back to their original positions in the original string `s`.

Here's a breakdown of what the program should do:
1. Identify all unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sort them in ascending order to form the string `r`.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second maps to the second last, etc.).
3. Use this mapping to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`.

However, the current implementation does not perform the mapping and decoding steps correctly. Instead, it simply replaces characters in `b` with characters from the reversed `r` without maintaining the correct mapping. This results in an incorrect output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
