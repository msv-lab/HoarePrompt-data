The code snippet provided only increments the variable `j` by 1. None of the other variables (`s`, `unique_chars`, `char`, `i`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found across all strings in `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`, and `char` is the next element in `s`. `i` is increased by 1. `j` is increased by 1.**
