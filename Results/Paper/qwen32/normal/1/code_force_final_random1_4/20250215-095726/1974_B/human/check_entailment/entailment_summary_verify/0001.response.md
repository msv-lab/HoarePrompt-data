Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string back to the original string as per the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Encoding Process**: 
  1. Construct a string `r` of all distinct letters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
  2. Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character from `r`.

- **Decoding Process**:
  - Given an encoded string `b`, reconstruct the original string `s` by reversing the encoding process.

### Provided Program Analysis:
- **Main Function**:
  ```python
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      t = int(input())
      for _ in range(t):
          n = int(input())
          b = input()
          encoded_str = func_1(b)
          print(encoded_str)
  ```
  - The main function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the encoded string `b`.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  ```python
  def func_1(s):
      unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
      (i, j) = (0, len(unique_chars) - 1)
      for char in s:
          if char in unique_chars:
              s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
              j -= 1
          else:
              unique_chars.insert(i, char)
              i += 1
              j += 1
      return ''.join(unique_chars)
  ```
  - **Unique Characters Extraction**: 
    - `unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))` extracts and sorts the unique characters from the encoded string `s`.
  - **Replacement Logic**:
    - The function attempts to replace each character in `s` with the corresponding symmetric character from `unique_chars` but uses `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])`, which incorrectly replaces all occurrences of `char` at once.
    - The `else` block is unnecessary because all characters in `s` should already be in `unique_chars`.
  - **Return Statement**:
    - `return ''.join(unique_chars)` returns the sorted unique characters instead of the decoded string.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**:
   - The use of `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` replaces all occurrences of `char` in `s` at once, which is incorrect. We need to replace each occurrence individually while maintaining the original order.
   
2. **Unnecessary Else Block**:
   - The `else` block is unnecessary and incorrect because every character in `s` should be in `unique_chars`.

3. **Incorrect Return Value**:
   - The function returns the sorted unique characters instead of the decoded string.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly decode the string:
1. Extract the unique characters from the encoded string and sort them.
2. Create a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters list to its symmetric counterpart.
3. Replace each character in the encoded string with its mapped value.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
