Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string back to the original string as per the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to decode the encoded string `s` (which is actually `b` in the main loop).
   - It starts by creating a list of unique characters from the encoded string `s` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` where `i` points to the beginning and `j` points to the end of the sorted unique characters list.
   - The function then iterates over each character in the encoded string `s`:
     - If the character is found in the list of unique characters, it replaces all occurrences of that character in `s` with the character at position `j` in the unique characters list and decrements `j`.
     - If the character is not found in the list of unique characters, it inserts the character at position `i` in the unique characters list, increments `i`, and also increments `j`. However, this part of the logic seems incorrect because the character should already be in the list since we are iterating over the encoded string which is derived from the original string using the unique characters list.

3. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The replacement logic inside the loop is flawed. The line `s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` replaces all occurrences of `char` in `s` at once, which is not what we want. We need to replace each occurrence individually while maintaining the original order.
   - The else condition `if char not in unique_chars` is unnecessary because the unique characters list is constructed from the encoded string `s`, so every character in `s` should be in the unique characters list.
   - The final return statement `return ''.join(unique_chars)` is incorrect because it returns the list of unique characters instead of the decoded string.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly decode the string, we need to:
1. Extract the unique characters from the encoded string and sort them.
2. Create a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters list to its symmetric counterpart.
3. Replace each character in the encoded string with its mapped value.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
