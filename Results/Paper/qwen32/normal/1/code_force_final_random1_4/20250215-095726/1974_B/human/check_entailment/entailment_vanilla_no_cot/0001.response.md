Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings (`data`).
   - It initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`) and increments the index.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string (`b`), and then calls `func_1` to decode the string.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of `b` in alphabetical order.
   - It constructs a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second maps to the second last, etc.).
   - It uses this `mapping` to decode the string `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character in `mapping`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the decoded strings, one per line.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Creating `r`:** The program correctly creates the auxiliary string `r` by taking the unique characters of the encoded string `b` and sorting them alphabetically.
- **Mapping Characters:** The program correctly sets up a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
- **Decoding Process:** The program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` by replacing each character according to the `mapping`.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** The program handles multiple test cases by iterating through each one, reading the necessary inputs, and producing the corresponding outputs.

### Conclusion:

The program accurately implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. It correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r`, sets up the appropriate mappings, and decodes the input strings.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
