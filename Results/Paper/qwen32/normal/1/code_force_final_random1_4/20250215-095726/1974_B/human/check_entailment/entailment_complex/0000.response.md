Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The function `func_1` attempts to replace characters in the string `s` with their symmetric counterparts from the sorted unique characters list `unique_chars`. However, it incorrectly modifies the string `s` within the loop, which leads to incorrect replacements because the string changes during iteration.

2. **Logic for Decoding**: To decode the string, we need to map each character in the encoded string `b` back to its original character using the symmetric property with respect to the sorted unique characters list `r`. This involves creating a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart and then using this mapping to transform the encoded string `b`.

3. **Incorrect Return Statement**: The function returns the sorted unique characters list `unique_chars` instead of the decoded string `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(b):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in b)
    return decoded_str
```

This corrected function first creates a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters list to its symmetric counterpart. It then uses this mapping to decode the string `b`.

Correctness: **False**
