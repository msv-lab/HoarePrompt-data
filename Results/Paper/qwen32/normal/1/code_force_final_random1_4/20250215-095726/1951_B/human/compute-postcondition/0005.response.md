The given code snippet appends the index `i` to the list `ind`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `ind` was initially an empty list and now contains the index `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is a list with two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively. The second part is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where all `a_i` are pairwise different. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `x` is the value of the `k`-th cow's rating in the current test case; `ind` is a list containing the index `i`; `c` is 0; `n` is at least 2. Additionally, `a[i]` is greater than `x`.**
