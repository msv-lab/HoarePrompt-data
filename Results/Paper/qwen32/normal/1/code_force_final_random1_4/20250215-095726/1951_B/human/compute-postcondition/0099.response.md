Postcondition: **`s` is a list with at least one element, `j` is `len(s) - 2`, `p` is `len(s) - 2`, `ans1` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` remains 0, `z` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `ans` is `len(s) - 1`. The value of `h` is `s[0]` initially, and `i` is equal to the initial value of `h`. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h` after the if condition, `h` is no longer equal to `s[0]`.**
