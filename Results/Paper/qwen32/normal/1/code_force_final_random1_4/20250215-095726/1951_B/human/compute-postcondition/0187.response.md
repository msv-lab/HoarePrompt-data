Output State: **`s` is a list of integers from the input with at least one element, `j` is the number of elements processed, `p` is the number of elements processed, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `t` is unchanged, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`, `i` is the (j+1)-th element of `s`. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1, `z` is 1.**
