Correctness: **False**

The provided code contains several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described. Here are some key points:

1. **Global Variable `n`**: The variable `n` is used inside the function `func_1`, but it is not passed as a parameter to the function. This will lead to a `NameError` because `n` is not defined within the scope of `func_1`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Maximum Wins**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to determine the maximum number of wins by finding the first two elements greater than the cow at position `k`. However, this logic does not account for the possibility of swapping the cow to a different position to maximize wins.
   - The function does not consider the scenario where swapping the cow to a different position might allow it to win more matches.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the cow at position `k` is already the strongest cow or when there are no cows stronger than the cow at position `k`.

4. **Unnecessary Print Statements**:
   - There are unnecessary print statements inside the function `func_1` that should be removed, as they do not contribute to the output.

To correctly solve the problem, the algorithm should:
- Determine the maximum number of wins if no swap is made.
- Consider all possible positions to swap the cow at position `k` and calculate the maximum number of wins for each swap.
- Return the maximum number of wins obtained from either no swap or any of the swaps.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def max_wins_without_swap(ratings, k):
    wins = 0
    current_max = ratings[k]
    for i in range(k + 1, len(ratings)):
        if ratings[i] < current_max:
            wins += 1
        else:
            break
    return wins

def max_wins_with_swap(ratings, k):
    max_wins = 0
    for i in range(len(ratings)):
        if i == k:
            continue
        # Swap the cow at position k with the cow at position i
        ratings[k], ratings[i] = ratings[i], ratings[k]
        wins = max_wins_without_swap(ratings, i)
        max_wins = max(max_wins, wins)
        # Swap back to original positions
        ratings[k], ratings[i] = ratings[i], ratings[k]
    return max_wins

def max_wins(ratings, k):
    return max(max_wins_without_swap(ratings, k), max_wins_with_swap(ratings, k))

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(max_wins(ratings, k))
```

This code correctly calculates the maximum number of wins by considering both scenarios: no swap and all possible swaps.
