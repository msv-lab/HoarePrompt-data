Postcondition: **`s` is a list of integers from the input with at least one element, `j` is the number of elements processed, `p` is the number of elements processed, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `t` is unchanged, and `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is one more than its previous value. If `s[0]` equals `h`, `z` is 1 and `ans1` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0.**
