Output State: **`j` is `len(s) - 2`, `p` is `len(s) - 2`, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 1 if any element in `s[1:]` was equal to `h` and `s[0]` was not equal to `h`, otherwise it is 0, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `s` is a list where the first element and the element at index `k-1` have not been swapped, `ans` is `len(s) - 1`, `h` is equal to `s[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans1` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
