You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is a list with two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively. The second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where all a_i are pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        
        if c == 2:
            break
        
    #State: 
    if (k == 14) :
        print(ind)
        #This is printed: ind (where ind is an undefined variable)
    #State: `k` is an integer. If `k` is equal to 14, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not evaluated further as there is no else part.
    if (ind == []) :
        return n - 1
        #The program returns 13
    #State: `k` is an integer, and `ind` is not an empty list
    if (len(ind) == 1) :
        if (ind[0] == 0) :
            return k - 1
            #The program returns k - 1, where k is an integer.
        #State: `k` is an integer, and `ind` is a non-empty list with exactly one element. The element of `ind` is not equal to 0.
        if (ind[0] > k) :
            return ind[0] - 1
            #The program returns the value of the single element in list `ind` minus 1, which is greater than `k` minus 1.
        #State: `k` is an integer, and `ind` is a non-empty list with exactly one element. The element of `ind` is not equal to 0 and is less than or equal to `k`.
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
        #The program returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`. Given that `ind[0]` is not equal to 0 and is less than or equal to `k`, the returned value is `k - ind[0]` unless `ind[0]` is 1, in which case the returned value is 0.
    #State: `k` is an integer, and `ind` is not an empty list with a length greater than 1
    if (ind[0] == 0) :
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
        #The program returns the minimum value between the second element of `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1.
    #State: `k` is an integer, and `ind` is not an empty list with a length greater than 1. The first element of `ind` is not 0.
    if (k > ind[1]) :
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
        #The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`. Given that `ind[0]` is not 0 and `k` (which is greater than `ind[1]`) is irrelevant to the calculation, the return value depends on the specific values of `ind[0]` and `ind[1]`.
    #State: `k` is an integer, and `ind` is not an empty list with a length greater than 1. The first element of `ind` is not 0. Additionally, `k` is less than or equal to the second element of `ind`.
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])
    #The program returns the maximum of (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0])
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: a list with two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively, and a list of `n` integers representing the unique Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. Based on these inputs, the function returns different values depending on the conditions specified in the test cases. Specifically, the function may return 13, `k - 1`, a value from a list `ind` minus 1, the result of comparisons and calculations involving elements of `ind` and `k`, or the maximum of certain differences involving `ind` and `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 13

Case_2: The program returns k - 1, where k is an integer.

Case_3: The program returns the value of the single element in list `ind` minus 1, which is greater than `k` minus 1.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`. Given that `ind[0]` is not equal to 0 and is less than or equal to `k`, the returned value is `k - ind[0]` unless `ind[0]` is 1, in which case the returned value is 0.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between the second element of `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1.

Case_6: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`. Given that `ind[0]` is not 0 and `k` (which is greater than `ind[1]`) is irrelevant to the calculation, the return value depends on the specific values of `ind[0]` and `ind[1]`.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum of (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0])
