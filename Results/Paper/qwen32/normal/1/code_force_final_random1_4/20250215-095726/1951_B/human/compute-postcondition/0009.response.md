The `break` statement in the given code does not affect any of the variables or their values. It only terminates the nearest enclosing loop. Since there is no loop structure provided in the context, the `break` statement has no effect here.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is a list with two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively. The second part is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where all `a_i` are pairwise different. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `x` is the value of the `k`-th cow's rating in the current test case; `ind` is a list containing the index `i` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` remains empty; `c` is 2; `n` is at least 2.**
