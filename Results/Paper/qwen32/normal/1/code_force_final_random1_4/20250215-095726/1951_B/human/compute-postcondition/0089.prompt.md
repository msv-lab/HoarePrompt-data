Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is -1, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` and meet the conditions specified in the loop, `z` is 1 if any element in `s[1:]` was equal to `h` and `s[0]` was not equal to `h`, otherwise it is 0, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `s` is a list where the first element and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is equal to `s[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is 0, `p` is -1, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` and meet the conditions specified in the loop, `z` is 1 if any element in `s[1:]` was equal to `h` and `s[0]` was not equal to `h`, otherwise it is 0, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `s` is a list with at least two elements where the first element and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped, `h` is equal to `s[0]`. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1 and `h` is greater than or equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 2, `p` is -1, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` and meet the conditions specified in the loop, `z` is 1 if any element in `s[1:]` was equal to `h` and `s[0]` was not equal to `h`, otherwise it is 0, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `s` is a list with at least two elements where the first element and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped, `h` is equal to `s[0]`, `i` is the next element in `s[1:]`. If `h < i`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 3, `p` is -1, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` and meet the conditions specified in the loop, `z` is 1 if any element in `s[1:]` was equal to `h` and `s[0]` was not equal to `h`, otherwise it is 0, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `s` is a list with at least two elements where the first element and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped, `h` is equal to `s[0]`, `i` is the next element in `s[1:]`. If `h < i`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
