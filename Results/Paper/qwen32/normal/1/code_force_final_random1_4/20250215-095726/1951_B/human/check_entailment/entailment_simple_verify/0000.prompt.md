You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. There are several issues with the code:

1. The function `func_1` is not defined within the scope of the provided code snippet, which means the program will throw a `NameError`.
2. The variable `n` is used within `func_1`, but it is not passed as an argument to the function.
3. The logic for determining the maximum number of wins is flawed. The current implementation does not consider the optimal swap strategy to maximize the number of wins for cow `k`.

Let's analyze the logic further:

- The code tries to find indices where the rating of other cows is greater than the rating of cow `k`. However, this alone is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of wins.
- The code does not consider the possibility of swapping cow `k` with another cow to strategically place it in a more advantageous position.
- The conditions for calculating the number of wins are not correctly implemented. For example, the condition `if ind == []: return n - 1` is incorrect because cow `k` cannot win all matches unless it is the highest-rated cow.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Determine the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve without any swap.
2. Consider all possible swaps of cow `k` with other cows and calculate the maximum number of wins for each scenario.
3. Return the maximum number of wins from these scenarios.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_wins_with_swap(n, k, ratings):
    def max_wins_without_swap():
        wins = 0
        current = ratings[k]
        for i in range(k + 1, n):
            if ratings[i] > current:
                break
            wins += 1
        return wins

    max_wins = max_wins_without_swap()
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i == k:
            continue
        # Swap cow k with cow i
        ratings[k], ratings[i] = ratings[i], ratings[k]
        wins = max_wins_without_swap()
        max_wins = max(max_wins, wins)
        # Swap back to original positions
        ratings[k], ratings[i] = ratings[i], ratings[k]

    return max_wins

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(max_wins_with_swap(n, k, ratings))
```

This corrected version considers all possible swaps and calculates the maximum number of wins for cow `k` in each scenario, ensuring that the solution is correct for all potential cases.
