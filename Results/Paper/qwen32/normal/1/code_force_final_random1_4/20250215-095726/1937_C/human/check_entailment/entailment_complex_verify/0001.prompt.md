You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴). For each test case, it interacts with an external process by sending queries and receiving responses to determine two specific indices, `k` and `best`, and then outputs these indices. The final state of the program after processing all test cases is that it has output the determined indices for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem requirements.

### Problem Understanding
The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) in a permutation \(p\) such that the bitwise XOR \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. We can achieve this by making queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, it reads the size \(n\) of the permutation.
2. **Finding the Best Candidate \(k\)**:
   - It initializes \(k\) to 1.
   - It iterates through the permutation starting from index 2.
   - For each index \(i\), it makes a query comparing the bitwise OR of \(p_0 \mid p_k\) with \(p_0 \mid p_i\).
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it updates \(k\) to \(i\). This means that \(p_0 \mid p_i\) is greater than \(p_0 \mid p_k\), suggesting that \(p_i\) might have more bits set compared to \(p_k\).
3. **Finding the Best Pair \((k, \text{best})\)**:
   - It initializes \(\text{best}\) to 0.
   - It iterates through the permutation starting from index 1.
   - For each index \(i\), it makes a query comparing the bitwise OR of \(p_k \mid p_\text{best}\) with \(p_k \mid p_i\).
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it updates \(\text{best}\) to \(i\). This means that \(p_k \mid p_i\) is greater than \(p_k \mid p_\text{best}\), suggesting that \(p_i\) might have more bits set when combined with \(p_k\).
4. **Output**: It prints the pair \((k, \text{best})\) as the indices that maximize the XOR.

### Correctness Analysis
The program aims to identify the pair \((i, j)\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. Here’s why the approach works:

- **Choosing \(k\)**: By comparing \(p_0 \mid p_k\) with \(p_0 \mid p_i\) for all \(i\), we aim to find an element \(p_k\) that has many bits set. This is because maximizing the OR operation often indicates that the numbers involved have more bits set, which can help in maximizing the XOR.
- **Choosing \(\text{best}\)**: After identifying \(k\), we compare \(p_k \mid p_\text{best}\) with \(p_k \mid p_i\) for all \(i\). This helps in finding another element \(p_\text{best}\) that, when combined with \(p_k\), results in a high OR value, which again suggests a high XOR value.

### Potential Issues
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles small values of \(n\) correctly, but it does not explicitly handle the case where \(n = 2\). However, since the loop starts from 2, it will still work for \(n = 2\) as it will directly compare \(p_0\) and \(p_1\).
- **Maximizing XOR**: While the approach of maximizing the OR operation is a heuristic, it is effective in practice for finding pairs that maximize the XOR operation due to the properties of bitwise operations.

### Conclusion
The program uses a reasonable heuristic to find a pair of indices that maximize the XOR operation within the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem requirements.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
