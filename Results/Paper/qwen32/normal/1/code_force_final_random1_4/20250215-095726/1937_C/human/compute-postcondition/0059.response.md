The code snippet sets the variable `best` to 0. This change affects only the variable `best`, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is the input integer; `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such response was received; `best` is 0.**
