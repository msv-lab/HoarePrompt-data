Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is 1, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was received; `res` is the value of the input received.**

In natural language: The value of `res` is now the input received from the user, while the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `best` remain unchanged.
