To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that the loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n`, which means the loop condition `i < n` was no longer satisfied, and thus the loop terminated.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `[2, n-1)`. Since the loop just ended because `i` was `n`, we need to set `i` back to the starting point of the range, which is `2`.

The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted because it defines the upper bound of the range and its value is already consistent with the loop's termination condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is `n` if `res` equals `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1; `best` is 1; `res` is the value of the user's new input; `i` is 2**
