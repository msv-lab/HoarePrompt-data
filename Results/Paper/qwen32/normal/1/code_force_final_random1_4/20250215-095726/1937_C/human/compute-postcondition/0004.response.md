To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Literal Values**: 
   - `'?'`: This is a literal string.
   - `0`: This is a literal integer.
   - `k`: Given that `k` is 1, this will be replaced with `1`.
   - `0`: Another literal integer.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, it is not possible to determine its value from the given information. Since `i` is not defined, this would normally result in a `NameError` if the code were executed. However, based on the task instructions, we should assume that `i` has some value, even though it's not explicitly stated.

Given that `i` is not defined, we cannot provide an exact numerical value for `i`. However, we can still describe the output in terms of `i`.

### Final Output Description:
The print statement will output the following sequence of values:
- A literal question mark `'?'`.
- The integer `0`.
- The value of `k`, which is `1`.
- Another integer `0`.
- The value of `i`, which is unknown but assumed to be some integer value.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 1 0 i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
