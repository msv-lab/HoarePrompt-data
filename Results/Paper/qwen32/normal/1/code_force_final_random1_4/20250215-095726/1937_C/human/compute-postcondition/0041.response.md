Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is the input integer; `k` is 1; `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was received.**

Explanation: The value of `k` has been set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
