Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `i` if `res` equals `'<'`, otherwise `k` remains 1, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was received; `res` is the value of the input received; `i` is `i_end + 1`.**
