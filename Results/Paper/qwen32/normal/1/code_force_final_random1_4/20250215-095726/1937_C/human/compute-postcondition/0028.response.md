To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is greater than 1.

However, the initial state does not provide explicit values for `k`, `best`, or the previous value of `i`. Therefore, we need to express the output in terms of these variables.

Hereâ€™s the print statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is a variable whose value is not specified.
- `best` is a variable whose value is not specified.
- `k` appears twice in the print statement.
- `i` is a variable that has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the lack of specific values for `k`, `best`, and the previous value of `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `k`, then the value of `best`, then the value of `k` again, and finally the incremented value of `i`.

Thus, the output can be described as:
Output: **? [k] [best] [k] [i+1] (where k is the value of k, best is the value of best, and i+1 is the incremented value of i)**
