To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (This variable does not directly affect the print statement).
   - `n`: Greater than 2 (This variable also does not directly affect the print statement).
   - `k`: Equals `i` if `res` equals `'<'`, otherwise `k` remains 1.
   - `best`: The largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was received.
   - `res`: The value of the input received.
   - `i`: Equals `i_end + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determining the values:**
   - The first argument is a literal string `'?'`.
   - The second argument is `0`.
   - The third argument is `k`. Since the exact value of `k` depends on `res` and `i`, we need to consider both possibilities:
     - If `res` equals `'<'`, then `k` equals `i`.
     - Otherwise, `k` remains `1`.
   - The fourth argument is `0`.
   - The fifth argument is `i`, which is `i_end + 1`.

Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:

- The first part of the output is always `'?'`.
- The second part is always `0`.
- The third part is `k`, which is either `i` (if `res` is `'<'`) or `1` (otherwise).
- The fourth part is always `0`.
- The fifth part is `i`, which is `i_end + 1`.

Since the exact values of `k` and `i` depend on the conditions specified, we can summarize the output as:

Output: **? 0 k 0 i (where k is i if res is '<', otherwise 1, and i is i_end + 1)**
