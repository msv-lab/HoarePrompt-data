The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`) such that `2 ≤ i_prev < n`. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should now be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `n` is given as greater than 2, and `i` starts from 2, `n` must be at least 3. After each iteration, `i` increases by 1, so for the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given that `t` and `res` are not part of the loop head, their values do not change. The variable `k` is set based on the value of `res` but does not affect the loop continuation condition.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 2; `res` is a string. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to the value of `i`. Otherwise, `k` remains 1; `i` is `i_prev + 1` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

To make this more concrete, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 2; `res` is a string. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to the value of `i`. Otherwise, `k` remains 1; `i` is 4** (assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration).

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we express the state in terms of `i_prev`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 2; `res` is a string. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to the value of `i`. Otherwise, `k` remains 1; `i` is `i_prev + 1`**
