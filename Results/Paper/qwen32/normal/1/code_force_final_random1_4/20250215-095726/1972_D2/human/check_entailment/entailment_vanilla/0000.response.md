Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case with given \(n\) and \(m\). Here's a breakdown of what it does:
1. It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
2. It iterates over possible values of `x` from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
3. For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1, checking the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
4. If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are not sufficient to cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). The code only considers pairs where `x` and `y` are relatively small compared to `n` and `m`.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The logic inside the nested loops does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is used, but this does not guarantee that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b` for all pairs \((a, b)\).

3. **Handling of Large Inputs**: The code does not efficiently handle large inputs within the constraints (\(n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)). The approach of iterating up to \(\sqrt{n}\) and then further checking conditions might miss some valid pairs and is not optimal.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It misses many valid pairs and does not handle the constraints efficiently.

**Correctness: False**
