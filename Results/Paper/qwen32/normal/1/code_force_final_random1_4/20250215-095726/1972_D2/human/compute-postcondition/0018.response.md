To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues to run and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` ≥ 1
- `m` is an integer
- `x` = 1
- `cnt` = 0
- `y` = 1

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as both `(x + y) * x ≤ n` and `(x + y) * y ≤ m`.

### Iteration Analysis:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `x = 1`, `y = 2`
   - Condition: `(1 + 2) * 1 ≤ n` and `(1 + 2) * 2 ≤ m` → `3 ≤ n` and `6 ≤ m`
   - If `gcd(1, 2) == 1` (which it is), `cnt += min(n / 6, m // 6)`

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `x = 1`, `y = 3`
   - Condition: `(1 + 3) * 1 ≤ n` and `(1 + 3) * 3 ≤ m` → `4 ≤ n` and `12 ≤ m`
   - If `gcd(1, 3) == 1` (which it is), `cnt += min(n / 12, m // 12)`

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `x = 1`, `y = 4`
   - Condition: `(1 + 4) * 1 ≤ n` and `(1 + 4) * 4 ≤ m` → `5 ≤ n` and `20 ≤ m`
   - If `gcd(1, 4) == 1` (which it is), `cnt += min(n / 20, m // 20)`

### General Pattern:
- The loop increments `y` by 1 in each iteration.
- The condition `(x + y) * x ≤ n` and `(x + y) * y ≤ m` must hold true for the loop to continue.
- If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

### Stopping Condition:
The loop stops when either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`.

### Final Output State:
Let's assume `n` and `m` are large enough to allow multiple iterations but will eventually stop the loop. For simplicity, let's assume `n` and `m` are such that the loop runs until `y` reaches a value where the conditions no longer hold.

For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 20`:
- First iteration: `y = 2`, `cnt += min(5/6, 20//6) = 0`
- Second iteration: `y = 3`, `cnt += min(5/12, 20//12) = 0`
- Third iteration: `y = 4`, `cnt += min(5/20, 20//20) = 0`
- Fourth iteration: `y = 5`, `(1 + 5) * 1 > 5` → loop stops.

Thus, the final state would be:
- `x` remains 1 (unchanged by the loop).
- `y` is the last value that satisfied the loop condition.
- `cnt` is the sum of the increments from each valid iteration.

### Conclusion:
Assuming `n` and `m` are such that the loop runs until `y` reaches a value where the conditions no longer hold, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `m` remains the same, `x` is 1, `y` is the last value that satisfied the loop condition, and `cnt` is the sum of the increments from each valid iteration.**

If we assume specific values for `n` and `m` that allow multiple iterations, the exact value of `y` and `cnt` can be calculated accordingly. For the given example with `n = 5` and `m = 20`, the final state would be:

Output State: **`n` is 5, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 4, and `cnt` is 0.**
