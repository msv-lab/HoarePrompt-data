To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the current state:
- `n` is 5
- `m` is 20
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 2
- If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is 2.5

Let's evaluate the conditions with these values:
1. `(x + y) * x = (1 + 2) * 1 = 3 * 1 = 3`
   - Check against `n`: `3 <= 5` (True)
2. `(x + y) * y = (1 + 2) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6`
   - Check against `m`: `6 <= 20` (True)

Both conditions are currently true, meaning the loop can execute one more time with the current values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

Since both conditions are satisfied, no adjustments are necessary to the state for the loop to execute one more time. We simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is 5, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, and if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is 2.5**
