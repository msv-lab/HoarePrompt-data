To determine the new value of `cnt`, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

Given the initial values:
- `n` is 6
- `m` is 20
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1

First, let's compute each part of the `min` function:

1. Calculate `n / ((x + y) * x)`:
   \[
   (x + y) * x = (2 + 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6
   \]
   \[
   n / 6 = 6 / 6 = 1
   \]

2. Calculate `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
   \[
   (x + y) * y = (2 + 1) * 1 = 3 * 1 = 3
   \]
   \[
   m // 3 = 20 // 3 = 6 \quad (\text{integer division})
   \]

Next, we find the minimum of these two values:
\[
\min(1, 6) = 1
\]

Now, add this result to `cnt`:
\[
cnt = 6.1667 + 1 = 7.1667
\]

The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only updated value is `cnt`.

Output State: **`n` is 6, `m` is 20, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is 7.1667.**
