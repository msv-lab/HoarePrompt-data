The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Initially, `y` is 1, so after the operation, `y` becomes 2. The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1` needs to be re-evaluated. Given `x` is 2 and `y` is now 2, `math.gcd(2, 2)` equals 2, which is not equal to 1. Therefore, `cnt` remains 6.1667. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 6, `m` is 20, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 6.1667.**
