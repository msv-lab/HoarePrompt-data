The code increments the value of `y` by 1. Initially, `y` is 3, so after the operation, `y` becomes 4. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The condition `If math.gcd(x, y) equals 1, cnt is increased by 1` is not evaluated or changed in this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 4. If `math.gcd(x, y)` equals 1, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
