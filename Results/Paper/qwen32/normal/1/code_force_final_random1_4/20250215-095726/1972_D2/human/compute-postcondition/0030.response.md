The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `y` was 2, so now `y` is 3. The condition for `cnt` remains unchanged because the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still checked with the new value of `y`. Since `x` is 1 and `y` is now 3, their greatest common divisor is still 1, so `cnt` remains 4.1667. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, and if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is 4.1667.**
