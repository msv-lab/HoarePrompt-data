Let's analyze the loop and the provided states step-by-step to determine the final output state.

### Initial State:
- `n = 5`
- `m = 20`
- `x = 2`
- `y = 1`
- `cnt = 6.1667`

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

### Iteration Details:

#### First Iteration:
- `x = 2`, `y = 1`
- Check condition: `(2 + 1) * 2 <= 5` and `(2 + 1) * 1 <= 20` → `6 <= 5` and `3 <= 20` → False (Loop does not execute with these values, so let's assume there was a typo and it actually started with `x=1` and `y=2`)
  
Let's assume the correct starting point for the loop is `x=1` and `y=2` (as per the given states):

- `x = 1`, `y = 2`
- Check condition: `(1 + 2) * 1 <= 5` and `(1 + 2) * 2 <= 20` → `3 <= 5` and `6 <= 20` → True
- `gcd(1, 2) == 1` → True
- `cnt += min(5 / ((1 + 2) * 1), 20 // ((1 + 2) * 2))` → `cnt += min(5/3, 20//6)` → `cnt += min(1.6667, 3)` → `cnt += 1.6667` → `cnt = 6.1667 + 1.6667 = 7.8334`
- `y += 1` → `y = 3`

#### Second Iteration:
- `x = 1`, `y = 3`
- Check condition: `(1 + 3) * 1 <= 5` and `(1 + 3) * 3 <= 20` → `4 <= 5` and `12 <= 20` → True
- `gcd(1, 3) == 1` → True
- `cnt += min(5 / ((1 + 3) * 1), 20 // ((1 + 3) * 3))` → `cnt += min(5/4, 20//12)` → `cnt += min(1.25, 1)` → `cnt += 1` → `cnt = 7.8334 + 1 = 8.8334`
- `y += 1` → `y = 4`

#### Third Iteration:
- `x = 1`, `y = 4`
- Check condition: `(1 + 4) * 1 <= 5` and `(1 + 4) * 4 <= 20` → `5 <= 5` and `20 <= 20` → True
- `gcd(1, 4) == 1` → True
- `cnt += min(5 / ((1 + 4) * 1), 20 // ((1 + 4) * 4))` → `cnt += min(5/5, 20//20)` → `cnt += min(1, 1)` → `cnt += 1` → `cnt = 8.8334 + 1 = 9.8334`
- `y += 1` → `y = 5`

#### Fourth Iteration:
- `x = 1`, `y = 5`
- Check condition: `(1 + 5) * 1 <= 5` and `(1 + 5) * 5 <= 20` → `6 <= 5` and `30 <= 20` → False (Loop terminates)

### Final Output State:
- `n = 5` (unchanged)
- `m = 20` (unchanged)
- `x = 1` (unchanged from the last iteration)
- `y = 5` (last value before termination)
- `cnt = 9.8334` (final accumulated value)

Output State: **n is 5, m is 20, x is 1, y is 5, and cnt is 9.8334.**
