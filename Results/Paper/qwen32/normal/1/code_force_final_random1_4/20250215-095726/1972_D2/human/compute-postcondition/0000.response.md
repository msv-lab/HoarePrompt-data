The value of `t` is reassigned to the integer value obtained from the user input. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, remains valid, but now `t` holds the specific value provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**
