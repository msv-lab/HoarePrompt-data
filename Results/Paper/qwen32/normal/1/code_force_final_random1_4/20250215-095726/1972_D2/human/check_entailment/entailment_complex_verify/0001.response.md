### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap
The goal is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Provided Program Analysis

##### Function `func_1()`
- **Input**: Reads \(n\) and \(m\) for a single test case.
- **Initialization**: Initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
- **Outer Loop**: Iterates over \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- **Inner Loop**: Iterates over \(y\) from 1, ensuring \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- **Condition Check**: Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- **Count Update**: If the condition is met, it updates the counter by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\).

##### Function `func_2()`
- **Input**: Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- **Processing**: Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Issues in the Provided Program

1. **Incorrect Iteration Logic**:
   - The loops only iterate over \(x\) and \(y\) up to certain bounds that do not necessarily cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The constraints \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) are too restrictive and do not guarantee that all valid pairs are considered.

2. **Incorrect Counting Logic**:
   - The counting logic uses `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, which does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The logic assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then all multiples of \(x\) and \(y\) will form valid pairs, which is not true.

3. **Handling of GCD**:
   - The program only checks pairs where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). However, the problem requires checking all pairs \((a, b)\) regardless of their GCD, as long as \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\) holds.

#### Annotations Analysis

- **State Before Function Call**: Correctly states that \(n\) and \(m\) are within the specified bounds.
- **State Inside `func_1()`**: The annotation mentions specific values for \(n\), \(m\), \(x\), \(y\), and `cnt`, but these values do not align with the problem requirements.
- **Overall Behavior**: The annotations suggest that the function calculates a count based on certain conditions, but the logic is flawed.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The iteration logic is too restrictive, the counting logic is incorrect, and the handling of GCD is insufficient.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
