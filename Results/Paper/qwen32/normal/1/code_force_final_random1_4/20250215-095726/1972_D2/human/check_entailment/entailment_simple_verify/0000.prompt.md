You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Function `func_1()`:
- It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
- It reads the values of `n` and `m`.
- It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` such that \(x \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\).
- Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions in `func_1()` do not correctly cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). Specifically, the condition \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) are too restrictive and miss many valid pairs.
2. **Integer Division**: The division operations in `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` should be integer divisions (`//`) to ensure the result is an integer.
3. **Counting Logic**: The counting logic is flawed because it assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then all multiples of \(x\) and \(y\) will form valid pairs, which is not necessarily true.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It misses many valid pairs due to the restrictive loop conditions and incorrect counting logic.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly restricts the pairs \((a, b)\) by the conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\), which are too restrictive. Additionally, the counting logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results for many test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
