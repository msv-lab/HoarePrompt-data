### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem statement.

The main goal is to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\),
2. \(1 \le b \le m\),
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

The code consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function is supposed to handle a single test case by reading \(n\) and \(m\), and then calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
- `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases \(t\) and calling `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Analysis of `func_1()`:
- The function initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over possible values of `x` such that \(x \cdot x \leq n\).
- For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
- Finally, it prints `cnt`.

However, there are several issues with this approach:
1. The loop condition \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) is not sufficient to ensure that all valid pairs \((a, b)\) are considered. The loop should iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.
2. The increment logic using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect because it doesn't correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be trying to count multiples of some form, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement.
3. The function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) directly, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

#### Analysis of `func_2()`:
- This function correctly reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
- Since `func_1()` is incorrect, `func_2()` will also produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_1()` is flawed, and it does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
