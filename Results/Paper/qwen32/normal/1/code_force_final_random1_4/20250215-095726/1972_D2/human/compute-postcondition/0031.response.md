To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m
```

Given the current state:
- `n` is 5
- `m` is 20
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` is 4.1667 (though `cnt` is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't affect the loop's execution)

Let's evaluate the conditions with the given values:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n` translates to `(1 + 3) * 1 <= 5` which is `4 <= 5` (True).
2. `(x + y) * y <= m` translates to `(1 + 3) * 3 <= 20` which is `12 <= 20` (True).

Since both conditions are true with the current values, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, or `y` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is 5, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 3**
