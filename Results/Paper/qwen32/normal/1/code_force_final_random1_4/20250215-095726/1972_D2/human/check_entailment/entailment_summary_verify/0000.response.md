Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the provided function summaries to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Function `func_1()`:
- It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
- It reads the values of `n` and `m`.
- It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` such that \(x \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\).
- Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions in `func_1()` do not correctly cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). Specifically, the condition \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) are too restrictive and miss many valid pairs.
2. **Integer Division**: The division operations in `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` should be integer divisions (`//`) to ensure the result is an integer.
3. **Counting Logic**: The counting logic is flawed because it assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then all multiples of \(x\) and \(y\) will form valid pairs, which is not necessarily true.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It misses many valid pairs due to the restrictive loop conditions and incorrect counting logic.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly restricts the pairs \((a, b)\) by the conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\), which are too restrictive. Additionally, the counting logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results for many test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the program:
- The loop conditions are too restrictive, missing many valid pairs.
- The division operations should use integer division.
- The counting logic is flawed, assuming that all multiples of \(x\) and \(y\) will form valid pairs when \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).

These issues mean that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
