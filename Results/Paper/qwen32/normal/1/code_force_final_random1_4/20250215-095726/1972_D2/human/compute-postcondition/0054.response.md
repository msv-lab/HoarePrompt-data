To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the given code and the provided output states after the first three iterations. The loop continues as long as \( x \times x \leq n \). Given that \( n \) is 5, the loop will execute as long as \( x \times x \leq 5 \). This means \( x \) can take values 1 and 2.

Let's break down the loop iterations:

### Iteration 1 (x=1):
- Initially, \( x = 1 \).
- Inner loop with \( y \) starts with \( y = 1 \).
- Conditions checked: \( (1+1)*1 \leq 5 \) and \( (1+1)*1 \leq 20 \) (both true).
- Since \( \text{gcd}(1, 1) = 1 \), \( cnt \) is incremented by \( \min(5 / (2*1), 20 // (2*1)) = \min(2.5, 10) = 2.5 \).
- Increment \( y \) to 2.
- Conditions checked: \( (1+2)*1 \leq 5 \) and \( (1+2)*2 \leq 20 \) (first condition false, so inner loop ends).
- Increment \( x \) to 2.

### Iteration 2 (x=2):
- Initially, \( x = 2 \).
- Inner loop with \( y \) starts with \( y = 1 \).
- Conditions checked: \( (2+1)*2 \leq 5 \) and \( (2+1)*1 \leq 20 \) (first condition false, so inner loop ends).
- Increment \( y \) to 2.
- Conditions checked: \( (2+2)*2 \leq 5 \) and \( (2+2)*2 \leq 20 \) (both false, so inner loop ends).
- Increment \( y \) to 3.
- Conditions checked: \( (2+3)*2 \leq 5 \) and \( (2+3)*3 \leq 20 \) (both false, so inner loop ends).
- Increment \( y \) to 4.
- Conditions checked: \( (2+4)*2 \leq 5 \) and \( (2+4)*4 \leq 20 \) (both false, so inner loop ends).
- Increment \( y \) to 5.
- Conditions checked: \( (2+5)*2 \leq 5 \) and \( (2+5)*5 \leq 20 \) (both false, so inner loop ends).
- Increment \( x \) to 3.

### Iteration 3 (x=3):
- Now \( x = 3 \), but \( 3 \times 3 > 5 \), so the outer loop terminates.

From the above analysis, the loop terminates after \( x = 2 \) because \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy the condition \( x \times x \leq 5 \).

Given the output states after the first three iterations, it appears there might be some rounding or precision issues in the provided \( cnt \) values. However, based on our analysis, the correct final value of \( cnt \) should be 2.5 from the first iteration alone, as no valid pairs \((x, y)\) were found in the second iteration that would increment \( cnt \).

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **n is 5, m is 20, x is 3, y is 5, and cnt is 2.5.** 

This means after all iterations, \( n \) remains 5, \( m \) remains 20, \( x \) is 3 (since the loop terminated), \( y \) is 5 (last value before termination), and \( cnt \) is 2.5.
