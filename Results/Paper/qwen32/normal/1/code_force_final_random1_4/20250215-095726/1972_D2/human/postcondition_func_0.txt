The function calculates and prints a count based on the number of pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are positive integers, `gcd(x, y) == 1`, and the product `(x + y) * x` does not exceed `n` and `(x + y) * y` does not exceed `m`. The result is a floating-point number representing the sum of minimum possible values derived from these conditions.
