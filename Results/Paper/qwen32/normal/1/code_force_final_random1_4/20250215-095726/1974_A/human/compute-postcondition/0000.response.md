Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `a` is set to the integer value of the input provided. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
