The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, and `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99. After executing the code, `x` and `y` will be updated to the values read from the input, while `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input, `a` must be greater than 0.**
