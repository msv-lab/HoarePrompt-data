Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is greater than 0, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2` if `m` is not less than `a`; otherwise, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 14) // 15`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.**
