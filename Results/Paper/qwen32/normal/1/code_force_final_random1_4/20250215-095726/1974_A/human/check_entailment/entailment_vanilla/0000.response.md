Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine the minimum number of 5x3 grids (screens) required to fit `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons.

### Key Points
- Each 5x3 grid has 15 cells.
- A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
- We need to minimize the number of screens used.

### Program Analysis
The program attempts to solve this problem using the following logic:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())  # Number of test cases
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())  # Number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons
        z = (y + 1) // 2  # Calculate the minimum number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        m = 15 * z - y * 4  # Calculate remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        if m < a:  # This condition seems incorrect as 'a' is the number of test cases, not related to remaining space
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15  # Adjust the number of screens based on remaining 1x1 icons
        print(z)  # Output the result for the current test case
```

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `if m < a:` is incorrect because `a` represents the number of test cases, not the remaining space. This condition does not make sense in the context of calculating the number of screens.
2. **Calculation of Remaining Space**: The calculation `m = 15 * z - y * 4` is intended to find the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this formula is not accurate because it assumes that the remaining space is always positive and directly subtracts the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons from the total cells available in `z` screens.
3. **Adjustment of Screens**: The adjustment `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` is also incorrect due to the incorrect value of `m`.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem:
1. Calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Determine how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2  # Minimum screens needed for 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = 15 * z - 4 * y  # Remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        if remaining_space < x:  # If remaining space is less than the number of 1x1 icons
            z += (x - remaining_space + 14) // 15  # Add additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        print(z)

func()
```

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the original program, it is clear that the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
