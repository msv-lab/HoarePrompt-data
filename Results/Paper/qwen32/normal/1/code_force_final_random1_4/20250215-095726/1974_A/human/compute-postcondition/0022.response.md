To determine what will be printed by the `print(z)` statement, let's break down the problem step by step using the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.
   - `a` is greater than 0.
   - `m` is calculated as \(15 \times \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) - y \times 4\).
   - `z` is calculated differently based on whether `m` is less than `a` or not:
     - If `m` is not less than `a`, then \(z = \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right)\).
     - If `m` is less than `a`, then \(z = \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{2x - 7y + 13}{30}\right)\).

2. **Step-by-step calculation:**
   - First, calculate `m` using the formula \(m = 15 \times \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) - y \times 4\).
   - Compare `m` with `a` to determine which formula to use for `z`.

Let's express this in a more detailed form:

- Calculate \( \frac{y + 1}{2} \). Since integer division is used in Python, this will be the floor division result.
- Use this result to calculate `m` as \( m = 15 \times \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) - 4y \).
- Compare `m` with `a`:
  - If `m >= a`, then \( z = \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) \).
  - If `m < a`, then \( z = \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{2x - 7y + 13}{30}\right) \).

Since the specific values of `x`, `y`, and `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `z`. However, we can describe the value of `z` based on the conditions given.

**Output Description:**
- If \( m \geq a \), then `z` is simply \(\left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right)\).
- If \( m < a \), then `z` is \(\left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{2x - 7y + 13}{30}\right)\).

Given these conditions, the output will depend on the values of `x`, `y`, and `a`. However, the precise formula for `z` can be described as follows:

Output: **z (where z is \(\left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right)\) if \( m \geq a \), otherwise \( z = \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{2x - 7y + 13}{30}\right)\))**
