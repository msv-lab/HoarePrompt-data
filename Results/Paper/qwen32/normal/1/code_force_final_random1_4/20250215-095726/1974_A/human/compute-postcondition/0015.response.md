To determine what will be printed by the `print(z)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Variables and Initial Conditions**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.
   - `a` is a positive integer.
   - `m` is calculated as \(15 * \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) - y * 4\).
   - `z` is determined based on the value of `m` relative to `a`:
     - If `m` is not less than `a`, then `z = (y + 1) // 2`.
     - Otherwise, `z = \left(\frac{4y + x + 14}{15}\right)\).

2. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - `m` is calculated using the formula \(15 * \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) - y * 4\).

3. **Determination of `z`**:
   - If `m >= a`, then `z` is simply \((y + 1) // 2\).
   - If `m < a`, then `z` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{4y + x + 14}{15}\right)\).

Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, and `a` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `z`. However, we can describe `z` precisely based on the conditions given.

### Explanation:
- First, compute `m` using the formula \(15 * \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) - y * 4\).
- Compare `m` with `a`:
  - If `m` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `z` is \((y + 1) // 2\).
  - If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is \(\left(\frac{4y + x + 14}{15}\right)\).

### Final Output Description:
The `print(z)` statement will print the value of `z` which is determined based on the conditions described above.

Output: **z (where z is (y + 1) // 2 if m >= a, otherwise z is (4y + x + 14) // 15, with m calculated as 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4)**
