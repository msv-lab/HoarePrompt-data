### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the given problem.

The program's logic seems flawed based on the given problem statement and the example outputs. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Calculation of `z`:**
   ```python
   z = (y + 1) // 2
   ```
   This line calculates the number of screens needed for the `2x2` icons. The formula `(y + 1) // 2` suggests that every two `2x2` icons can fit into one screen, but this is not entirely accurate. Two `2x2` icons cannot fit into a single `5x3` grid because they require 8 cells, and the grid only has 15 cells. Therefore, the correct approach would be to consider that each `2x2` icon requires at least one screen, and we need to check how many `1x1` icons can fit into the remaining space.

2. **Calculation of `m`:**
   ```python
   m = 15 * z - y * 4
   ```
   This line calculates the remaining space after placing `y` `2x2` icons. However, the formula does not correctly account for the available space in the grid. Each `2x2` icon takes up 4 cells, so the total space taken by `y` `2x2` icons is `4 * y`. The remaining space should be calculated based on the actual grid capacity minus the space taken by the `2x2` icons.

3. **Adjustment for `1x1` icons:**
   ```python
   if m < a:
       z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
   ```
   This part of the code attempts to adjust the number of screens based on the remaining space for `1x1` icons. However, the condition `if m < a` is incorrect and does not make sense in this context. The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, not any relevant quantity for this calculation. Instead, the code should check if there is enough space left in the current screens for all `1x1` icons. If not, additional screens should be added.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Place as many `2x2` icons as possible on the screens.
2. Calculate the remaining space on those screens.
3. Place the `1x1` icons in the remaining space, adding new screens as necessary.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Each 2x2 icon needs 4 cells and occupies a 2x2 area
        screens_for_2x2 = y
        
        # Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - 4 * y
        
        # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens = (x - remaining_cells + 14) // 15 if x > remaining_cells else 0
        
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis above, the original program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
