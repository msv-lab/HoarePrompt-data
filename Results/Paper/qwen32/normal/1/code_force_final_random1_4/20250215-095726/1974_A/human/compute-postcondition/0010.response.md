The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state includes several variables (`t`, `a`, `z`, `m`, `i`) whose values are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Here's the impact of the code on the program:
- `x` and `y` are reassigned to the values read from the input.

Since `t`, `a`, `z`, `m`, and `i` are not modified by the provided code snippet, they retain their initial values. The new values of `x` and `y` are determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is greater than 0, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2` if `m` is not less than `a`; otherwise, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 14) // 15`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`, `i` is `i + 1`**
