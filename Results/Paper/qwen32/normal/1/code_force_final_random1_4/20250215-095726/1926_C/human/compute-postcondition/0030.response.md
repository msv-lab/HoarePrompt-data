To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `pd` list. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = 200000` (since `N` is 200001). For each iteration `i`, it performs two main operations:
1. Adds the value of `pd[i-1]` to `pd[i]`.
2. Adds the sum of the digits of `i` to `pd[i]`.

This means that `pd[i]` accumulates the sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `i`, plus the accumulated sums from previous indices.

Let's break down the final state of `pd`:
- `pd[1]` will be the sum of the digits of `1`.
- `pd[2]` will be the sum of the digits of `1` plus the sum of the digits of `2`.
- `pd[3]` will be the sum of the digits of `1`, `2`, and `3`, plus the accumulated sums from previous indices.
- This pattern continues up to `pd[200000]`.

The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop, and `i` will be `200001` after the loop completes.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, N is 200001, pd is a list where pd[i] for i from 1 to 200000 contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to i, and i is 200001.**

In simpler terms, `pd[i]` holds the total sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `i` for each `i` from `1` to `200000`, and `i` ends up being `200001` after the loop finishes.
