To determine how to modify the program state so that the `while` loop can proceed, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the state description.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while num != 0:
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is not equal to `0`.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` is a list of integers where each integer \( n \) is updated to \( \text{int}(n / 10) \).
- `a` is no longer valid as the elements of `num` have changed.

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `num` is not equal to `0`. However, `num` is a list, not an integer, so the comparison `num != 0` might not work as expected in Python because it checks if the list is empty (`[]`) rather than comparing the list to an integer `0`.

2. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `num` is not an empty list. Since the elements of `num` are updated to `int(n / 10)`, it implies that the elements of `num` are being divided by 10 and converted to integers. This process will eventually lead to all elements becoming `0` if they were originally non-zero, and the list will become `[0, 0, ..., 0]`.

3. **Ensuring Loop Continues**: To ensure the loop continues, we need to make sure that `num` is not an empty list and contains at least one non-zero element.

### Conclusion:

To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `num` is not an empty list and contains at least one non-zero element. Since the elements are being divided by 10, we can adjust the state such that `num` contains at least one element that is not `0`.

State: **`num` is a list of integers containing at least one non-zero element**.
