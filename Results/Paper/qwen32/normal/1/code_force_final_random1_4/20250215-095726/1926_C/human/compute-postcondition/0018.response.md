In this task, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of the variable `i`.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[i]` which is the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `t` with `pd[4]` being `7 + 2 * int(j)`, `i` is 4.
- Loop statement: `for j in str(i):`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4, and the loop iterated over each character in `str(i)`, which is `"4"`. Since there's only one character in `"4"`, the loop would have completed its iteration for `i = 4`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to the next value that needs to be processed. However, since the loop iterates over each digit of `i` and we've already processed `i = 4`, the next logical step is to increment `i` to the next integer.

Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to 5 to start processing the next integer.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[i]` which is the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `t` with `pd[4]` being `7 + 2 * int(j)`, `i` is 5**
