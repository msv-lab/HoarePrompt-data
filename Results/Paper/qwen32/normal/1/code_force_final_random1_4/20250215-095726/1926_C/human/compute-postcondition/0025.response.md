In the given task, the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. The loop variable `j` takes on the value of each character in the string `str(i)` during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer
- `N` is 200001
- `i` is `t`
- `pd[t]` is `pd[t] + pd[t - 1] + int(j)`

We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop. The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the implicit iteration over `str(i)`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Determine the current position in the string**: Since `j` was the last character processed in the previous iteration, we need to move to the next character in `str(i)`.
2. **Adjust `j`**: `j` should now be the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Let's denote the string representation of `i` as `s = str(i)`. Suppose `j` was `s[k]` in the previous iteration. In the next iteration, `j` should be `s[k+1]`.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k` (the index of `j` in `s`), we can only express the state in terms of the next character in the sequence.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains the same
- `N` remains the same
- `i` remains the same (`i` is `t`)
- `pd[t]` remains the same (it was updated in the previous iteration and does not change until the next iteration starts)
- `j` is the next character in the string representation of `i`

Since we don't have the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we can't specify the exact next `j`. However, we can describe it as the next character in the string representation of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer, `N` is 200001, `i` is `t`, `pd[t]` is `pd[t] + pd[t - 1] + int(j)`, `j` is the next character in the string representation of `i`**
