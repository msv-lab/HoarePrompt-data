To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it modifies the variables.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each digit `j` of the string representation of `i`.
- For each digit `j`, it adds the integer value of `j` to `pd[i]`.

### Initial State:
- `t` remains the same as the input integer `N`: 200001.
- `i` is initialized to `t`, so `i` is also 200001.
- `pd[t]` is initially `pd[t] + pd[t - 1]`.

### Loop Execution:
- In each iteration, the loop processes one digit of `i` (which is 200001).
- The digits of `i` are: 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.

### Sum of Digits:
- The sum of the digits of `i` (200001) is `2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3`.

### Final Output State:
- After all iterations, `pd[t]` will be incremented by the sum of the digits of `i`.
- Therefore, `pd[t]` becomes `pd[t] + pd[t - 1] + 3`.

### Conclusion:
The final state of the variables, adhering to the specified format, is:

Output State: **t is an integer, N is 200001, i is t, pd[t] is pd[t] + pd[t - 1] + 3.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has processed all the digits of `i` (which is 200001), the value of `pd[t]` will be its initial value plus the sum of the digits of `i` (which is 3). All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
