The code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` increments the value of `pd[i]` by the integer value of `j`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `t`, so `pd[i]` is equivalent to `pd[t]`.

Initially, `pd[t]` is given as `pd[t] + pd[t - 1]`, which means `pd[t]` already holds the sum of `pd[t]` and `pd[t - 1]`. After executing the code, `pd[t]` will be further incremented by `int(j)`.

Thus, the new value of `pd[t]` (or `pd[i]`) will be the previous value of `pd[t]` (which is `pd[t] + pd[t - 1]`) plus `int(j)`.

Therefore, the updated value of `pd[t]` will be `pd[t] + pd[t - 1] + int(j)`. 

The other variables (`t`, `N`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `N` is 200001, `i` is `t`, `pd[t]` is `pd[t] + pd[t - 1] + int(j)`**
