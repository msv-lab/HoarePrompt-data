Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which is `1` and potentially updated at index `0` or others, `tot` is potentially updated, `bipartite` is potentially `False`, `i` is potentially updated, `ok` is `True` if `ok` was `True` or if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `ok` is updated based on its current value or the logical condition involving `bipartite` and `tot`. If `ok` was already `True`, it remains `True`. Otherwise, `ok` becomes `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
