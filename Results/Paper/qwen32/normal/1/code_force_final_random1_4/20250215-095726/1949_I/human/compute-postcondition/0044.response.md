Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. It operates using predefined global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite`. The function appears to perform some form of graph traversal or analysis related to disks defined by their centers (`x[i]`, `y[i]`) and radii (`r[i]`). The function returns no explicit value (implying it may modify global state or have side effects).**
