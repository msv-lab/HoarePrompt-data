Postcondition: **`n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which may be `True` if the if condition was met and `visited[i]` is now `True` if the if condition was met, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which may be `1` or potentially updated if the if condition was met for `i` and `coef[i]` is now `1` or potentially updated if the if condition was met, `tot` is potentially updated, `bipartite` is potentially `False`, `i` is `k + 2` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), and `ok` is updated to `ok or (bipartite and tot != 0)` if the if condition was met. If the if condition was not met, the variables remain unchanged.**
