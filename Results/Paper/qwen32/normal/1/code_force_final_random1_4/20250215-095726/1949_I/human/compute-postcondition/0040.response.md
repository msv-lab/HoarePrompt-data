Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is an integer input between 1 and 1000.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of `n` integers each, presumably representing coordinates and some associated values respectively.
- `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating if a node was visited during a Depth-First Search (DFS).
- `coef` is a list of integers (`1` or `-1`) indicating the bipartition of the graph.
- `tot` is the sum of the `r` values for nodes in one of the partitions.
- `bipartite` is a boolean indicating whether the graph is bipartite.
- `i` is set to `n` after completing all iterations of a loop.
- `ok` is a boolean set to `True`.
- There is at least one bipartite component with a non-zero total `r` value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state are used within this specific `print` statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, `i`, or `ok`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
