Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `visited` is a list of boolean values where each element is `True` if the corresponding node was visited during the DFS traversals, `coef` is a list of integers where each element is either `1` or `-1` indicating the bipartition of the graph, `tot` is the sum of the `r` values for nodes in one of the partitions, `bipartite` is `True` if the graph is bipartite and `False` otherwise, `i` is `n` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), and `ok` is `True` if there exists at least one bipartite component with a non-zero total `r` value, otherwise `False`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, the output state reflects that every node has been visited (`visited` list contains all `True` values). The `coef` list indicates the partitioning of the graph into two sets, with each node marked as `1` or `-1`. The variable `tot` holds the sum of the `r` values for nodes in one of these partitions. The `bipartite` variable indicates whether the entire graph can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent. The loop counter `i` will be equal to `n`, showing that the loop has iterated through all nodes. Finally, `ok` will be `True` if there is at least one bipartite component with a non-zero total `r` value, otherwise, it will be `False`.
