#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers representing the sums of three different groups of numbers, and they must satisfy the triangle inequality conditions to form a triangle with positive area.
def func_1(a, b, c):
    return a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if three given positive integers can represent the sides of a triangle with a positive area by verifying the triangle inequality conditions. It returns `True` if the conditions are satisfied, otherwise it returns `False`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the total number of integers, na, nb, nc are integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that na + nb + nc = n, and numbers is a list of n positive integers.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the total number of integers, `na` is `ceil(n/3)`, `nb` is `floor(n/3)`, `nc` is `floor(n/3)` (or `floor(n/3) - 1` if `n % 3 == 1`), `numbers` is an empty list, `group_a` contains the first, fourth, seventh, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list, `group_b` contains the second, fifth, eighth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list, `group_c` contains the third, sixth, ninth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list, `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`.
    #
    #In natural language:
    #After all iterations, `group_a` will contain every third number starting from the first, `group_b` will contain every third number starting from the second, and `group_c` will contain every third number starting from the third. The sums `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` will be the sums of the numbers in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, respectively. The `numbers` list will be empty.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c. Here, group_a contains the first, fourth, seventh, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list; group_b contains the second, fifth, eighth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list; and group_c contains the third, sixth, ninth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is initially an empty list, group_a, group_b, and group_c are also empty lists.
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes an integer `n`, three group size integers `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and a list of `n` positive integers `numbers`. It sorts the list in descending order and then distributes the numbers into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) such that `group_a` contains every third number starting from the first, `group_b` contains every third number starting from the second, and `group_c` contains every third number starting from the third. It calculates the sums of these groups and checks a condition using `func_1`. If the condition is met, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
