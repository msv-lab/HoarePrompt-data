Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the total number of integers, `na` is `ceil(n/3)`, `nb` is `floor(n/3)`, `nc` is `floor(n/3)` (or `floor(n/3) - 1` if `n % 3 == 1`). `numbers` is an empty list. `group_a` contains the first, fourth, seventh, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list, `group_b` contains the second, fifth, eighth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list, `group_c` contains the third, sixth, ninth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list. `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`. The function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to True.**

In natural language:
- `n` is an integer representing the total number of integers.
- `na` is the ceiling of `n/3`.
- `nb` is the floor of `n/3`.
- `nc` is the floor of `n/3` (or `floor(n/3) - 1` if `n % 3 == 1`).
- `numbers` is an empty list.
- `group_a` contains every third number starting from the first.
- `group_b` contains every third number starting from the second.
- `group_c` contains every third number starting from the third.
- `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`.
- `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`.
- `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`.
- The function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to True.
