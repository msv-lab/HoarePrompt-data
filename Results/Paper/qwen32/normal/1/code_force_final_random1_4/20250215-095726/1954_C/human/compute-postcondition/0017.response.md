The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so after the operation, `i` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a non-empty list of integers with length greater than 2; `b` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` or longer, where `a[0] == b[0]`, `a[1] == b[1]`, and `a[2] == b[2]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`, `new[1]` is `a[1]`, and `new[2]` is `max(a[2], b[2])`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`, `new2[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, and `new2[2]` is `a[2]`; `i` is 3.**
