Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, composed solely of digits from 1 to 9. For each test case, it generates two new numbers: one where digits are taken as the maximum of corresponding digits from `x` and `y`, and another where digits are taken as the minimum of corresponding digits from `x` and `y`. These two new numbers are printed for each test case.**
