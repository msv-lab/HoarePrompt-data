Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a new list of integers with at least two elements; `b` is a new list of integers with at least two elements, `b[0]` equals `a[0]`, and `b[1]` equals `a[1]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is `a[0]` and `new[1]` which is `a[1]`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` which is `a[0]` and `new2[1]` which is `a[1]`; `i` is 2**.

In natural language: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
