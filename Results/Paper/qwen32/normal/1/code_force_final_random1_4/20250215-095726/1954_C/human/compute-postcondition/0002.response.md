The code snippet reads a line of input, converts each character to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `a` is a list of integers derived from some input. The value of `t` and the contents of `a` are not altered by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `b` is a list of integers derived from the current input line.**
