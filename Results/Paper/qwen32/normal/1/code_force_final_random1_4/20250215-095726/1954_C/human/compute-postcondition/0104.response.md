Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers where `b` differs from `a` at at least one index; `new` is a list of integers where `new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])`; `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])` for the specific index `i` and `new2[j] = min(a[j], b[j])` for all other indices `j`; `i` is the smallest index where `a[i] != b[i]` plus two.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it the smallest index where `a[i] != b[i]` plus two. All other variables remain unchanged.
