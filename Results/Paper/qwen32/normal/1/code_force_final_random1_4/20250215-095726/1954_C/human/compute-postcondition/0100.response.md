The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `new` is a list of integers where `new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])` for the specific `i` where `a[i] != b[i]`; `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])` for the specific `i` where `a[i] != b[i]`; `i` is the smallest index where `a[i] != b[i]` plus one.**
