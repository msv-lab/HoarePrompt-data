The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` was initially `k + 3`, after incrementing, `i` becomes `k + 4`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a new list of integers with length greater than `k + 3`; `b` is a new list of integers; `new` is a list where the first `k` elements are the values of `a` (or `b`) and the `i`-th element is now `min(a[i], b[i])`, with the rest being `None`; `new2` is a list where the first `k` elements are the values of `a` (or `b`) and the `i`-th element is now `max(a[i], b[i])`, with the rest being `None`; `i` is `k + 4`, where `k` is the smallest index such that `a[k] != b[k]` or `k` is the length of `a`; `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, meaning there exists at least one index `k` where `a[k]` is not equal to `b[k]`; `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`.**
