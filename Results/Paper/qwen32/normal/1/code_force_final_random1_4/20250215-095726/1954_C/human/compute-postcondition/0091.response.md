Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `b` is a list of integers where `b[0]` is equal to `a[0]` and `b[1]` is equal to `a[1]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]` and `new[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]` and `new2[1]` is `a[1]`; `i` is 2**.

In simple terms, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
