Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` or longer; `new` is a list where `new[j] = a[j]` for all `j < i+1` and `new[j] = None` for all `j > i+1`, and `new[i+1] = min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`; `new2` is a list where `new2[j] = a[j]` for all `j < i+1` and `new2[j] = None` for all `j >= i+1`, except `new2[i+1] = max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`; `i` is the smallest index such that `a[i+1] != b[i+1]` and `i+1` must be less than `len(a) - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so now `i` points to the next index. The lists `new` and `new2` are updated to reflect the new value of `i`. The conditions for `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
