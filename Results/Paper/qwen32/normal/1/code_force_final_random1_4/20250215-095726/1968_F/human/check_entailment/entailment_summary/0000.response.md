### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if a given subarray can be divided into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is equal. The approach taken by the program involves using prefix XORs and binary search to efficiently answer each query.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the prefix XOR array `pf`, where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
   - This allows quick calculation of the XOR of any subarray `[l, r]` using the formula `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

2. **Mapping Prefix XORs to Indices**:
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to map each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this prefix XOR occurs.
   - This helps in quickly finding if there are other occurrences of the same prefix XOR within a given range.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `[l, r]` using the prefix XORs.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is zero (`x == 0`), it means the entire subarray can be considered as one segment with XOR zero, thus it is trivially interesting.
   - Otherwise, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find if there are indices in the range `[l, r]` where the prefix XOR repeats, indicating potential segments with equal XOR values.
   - Specifically, it checks if there exists an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that `pf[i] == pf[r]` and another index `j` in the range `[l, r]` such that `pf[j] == pf[l-1]`. This would imply that the subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR.

4. **Result Compilation**:
   - The results for each query are stored in a list and printed at the end, with an empty line separating results of different test cases.

### Analysis:

The logic appears sound and correctly implements the intended solution. The use of prefix XORs and binary search ensures efficient handling of the large input sizes specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program seems to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore,

**Correctness: True**
