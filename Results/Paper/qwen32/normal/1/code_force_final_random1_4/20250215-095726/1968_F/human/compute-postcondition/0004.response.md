Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; the first element of `data` is the integer `t`; the remaining elements are the integers `n`, `q`, and the elements of `a` and the queries, all as strings; `idx` is 1; `t` is the integer value of the first element of `data`; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. All other variables (`data`, `idx`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
