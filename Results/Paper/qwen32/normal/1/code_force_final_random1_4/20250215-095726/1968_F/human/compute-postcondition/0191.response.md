The code snippet provided is:

```python
mp[pf[i]] = []
```

This line of code assigns an empty list to the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`.

Given the Initial State, we know:
- `pf[i]` is a specific value (which is `pf[n]` since `i` is `n`).
- `mp` is a dictionary where `mp[pf[i]]` could already exist with some value or not.

After executing the line of code, `mp[pf[i]]` will definitely be an empty list. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 5`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 5])` and is at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 4])` and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])` and `a[n + 1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 2])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` and `pf[i - 1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 3])`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` strings, the last of which is an empty string, and the others are each either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is `n`. `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list.**
