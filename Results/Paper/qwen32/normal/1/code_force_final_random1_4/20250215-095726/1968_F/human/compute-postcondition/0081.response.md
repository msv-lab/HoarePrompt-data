The given code snippet simply appends the string `'NO'` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified or used in this operation.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 9`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` minus 2 that must be greater than or equal to 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) which are the integer values of `data[i + 2]`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) which are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a dictionary where keys are the unique values of `pf[i]` and values are lists of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is the integer value of `data[n + 7]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` is a list containing the string 'NO' appended to its previous contents; `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[r]`; `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`; `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element not less than `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**
