You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The array a contains n integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < 2^30. Each query is defined by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        
        idx += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = {(0): [0]}
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            if pf[i] not in mp:
                mp[pf[i]] = []
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
            v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
            it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
        results.append('')
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings; `idx` points to the position right after the last pair of `l` and `r` processed; `t` is 0; `results` is a list containing all results from all test cases, each test case contributing `q_i` results followed by an empty string; `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` reflect the state of the last processed test case.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: Each result from the test cases, separated by newlines, with an empty line between results of different test cases
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no direct parameters but processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a` and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The array `a` contains `n` integers, and each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`. The function processes these queries and returns the result for each query, which is likely the sum or some aggregate of the elements in the subarray from index `l` to `r` (1-based indexing).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
