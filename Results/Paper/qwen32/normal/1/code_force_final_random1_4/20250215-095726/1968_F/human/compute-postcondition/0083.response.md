Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` minus `q` that must be 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) which are the integer values of `data[i + 2]`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) which are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a dictionary where keys are the unique values of `pf[i]` and values are lists of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key; `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration.`**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `idx` will have increased by `2*q` from its initial value (`n + 3`). The variable `q` will be reduced to 0 because all queries have been processed. The `results` list will contain `q` elements, each indicating whether a specific condition was met ('YES') or not ('NO') for each query processed in the loop. All other variables like `data`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` will remain unchanged from their definitions in the initial state except for the modifications inherently required by the loop's logic.
