The given code snippet is simply `continue`. This statement is used within loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided context, the `continue` statement does not affect the flow or the values of any variables.

Therefore, none of the variables are modified, and the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 2 + n + 4`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 2 - n])` and is at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 1 - n]) - 1` and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `idx - n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `results` is a list containing `q + 3` strings, the last three of which are an empty string, either 'YES' or 'NO', and 'YES'; the others are each either 'YES' or 'NO'; `mp` is a dictionary where keys are unique XOR values from `pf` and values are lists of indices from `a` that produce these XOR values; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]; r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]; x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]; v1` is the list of indices from `mp` associated with the key `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`; `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` associated with the key `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then the last element of `results` is 'YES'. Otherwise, the last element of `results` is 'NO'.**
