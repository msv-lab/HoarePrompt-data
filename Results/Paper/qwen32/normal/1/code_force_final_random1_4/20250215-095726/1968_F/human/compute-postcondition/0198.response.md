The code snippet increments the value of `idx` by 2. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is the new value of `idx`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 2 + n + 2`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 2 - n])` and is at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 1 - n])` and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `idx - n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` strings, the last of which is an empty string, and the others are each either 'YES' or 'NO'; `mp` is a dictionary where keys are unique XOR values from `pf` and values are lists of indices from `a` that produce these XOR values; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]; r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.**
