Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 2 - n])` and is at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 1 - n])` and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `idx - n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` strings, the last of which is an empty string, and the others are each either 'YES' or 'NO'; `mp` is a dictionary where keys are unique XOR values from `pf` and values are lists of indices from `a` that produce these XOR values.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The `idx` variable will have increased by `n` from its initial value, reflecting that we've processed `n` more elements from the `data` list.
- The `a` list will contain `n + 1` elements, where the first element is `0` (unchanged) and the next `n` elements are integers parsed from the `data` list starting from the position indicated by the initial `idx`.
- The `pf` list will contain cumulative XOR values starting from `0` (unchanged at index `0`) and up to `n`, where each `pf[i]` is the result of XORing all elements in `a` from index `1` to `i`.
- The `mp` dictionary will map each unique XOR value found in `pf` to a list of indices in `a` that produce those XOR values.
- The `results` list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
