To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
```

This line of code uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `l` in the sorted list `v1`. The variable `it1` will hold this index.

Given the initial state, here are the variables that remain unchanged:
- `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1.
- `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 2 + n + 4 + 2`.
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is `int(data[idx - 2 - n])` and is at least 1.
- `q` is `q - 1` and is greater than 0.
- `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.
- `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, `results` contains the string `'YES'`.
- `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`.
- `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.

The only new variable introduced is `it1`, which holds the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 2 + n + 4 + 2`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 2 - n])` and is at least 1; `q` is `q - 1` and is greater than 0; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, `results` contains the string `'YES'`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order.**
