The code initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` zeros. The values of `data`, `idx`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; the first element of `data` is the integer `t`; the remaining elements are the integers `n`, `q`, and the elements of `a` and the queries, all as strings; `idx` is 3; `t` is the integer value of the first element of `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
