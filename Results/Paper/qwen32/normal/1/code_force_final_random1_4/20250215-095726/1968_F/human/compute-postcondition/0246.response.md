To determine what will be printed by the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

- `data`: A list of strings. This list contains the input data for the program.
- `idx`: Points to the position right after the last pair of `l` and `r` processed. This variable keeps track of the current processing position in the `data` list.
- `t`: An integer initialized to 0. It likely represents the number of test cases processed.
- `results`: A list that accumulates all results from all test cases. Each test case contributes `q_i` results followed by an empty string.
- `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp`: These variables reflect the state of the last processed test case. `n` might represent the number of elements in a list, `q` the number of queries, `a` could be an array, `pf` possibly a prefix sum, and `mp` a mapping or dictionary.

Given this context, the `results` list contains the outputs of all processed test cases, with each test case's results followed by an empty string for separation.

When the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement is executed, it joins all elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). 

Therefore, the output will be a series of lines, where each line corresponds to a result from the test cases, and there will be an empty line between the results of different test cases.

Output: **Each result from the test cases, separated by newlines, with an empty line between results of different test cases**.
