The code snippet `v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])` retrieves the list of indices from the dictionary `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`. If `pf[r]` does not exist in `mp`, it defaults to an empty list `[]`.

Given the initial state, the variables `data`, `idx`, `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `v1`, which is assigned the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[r]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 5`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) which are the integer values of `data[i + 2]`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) which are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a dictionary where keys are the unique values of `pf[i]` and values are lists of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` equals 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` remains an empty list; `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[r]`.**
