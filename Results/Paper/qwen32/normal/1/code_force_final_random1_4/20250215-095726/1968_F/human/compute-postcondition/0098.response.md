Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1, `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 3`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`, `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `a[i]`, `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus one additional empty string. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, `mp` is updated to have keys `0` and `pf[i]`, where the value for key `0` is a list containing only `0` and the value for key `pf[i]` is an empty list `[]`.**
