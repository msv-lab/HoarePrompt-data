Output State: **`freq` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of the `i-th` letter ('A' + i) in the string `a`; `missing` is the sum of `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`; `results` now includes `missing` as its last element.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `results` list has been updated to include the `missing` value as its last element. All other variables (`freq` and `missing`) remain unchanged.
