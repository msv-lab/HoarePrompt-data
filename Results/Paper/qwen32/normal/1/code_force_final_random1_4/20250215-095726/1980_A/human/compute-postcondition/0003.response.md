The code snippet assigns the values from the `_`-th tuple in the `test_cases` list to the variables `n`, `m`, and `a`. This means that the values of `n`, `m`, and `a` will be updated based on the contents of the `_`-th tuple.

Given the initial state, `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged. Only `n`, `m`, and `a` are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, an integer `m` such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `_`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the `_`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the `_`-th tuple in `test_cases`.**
