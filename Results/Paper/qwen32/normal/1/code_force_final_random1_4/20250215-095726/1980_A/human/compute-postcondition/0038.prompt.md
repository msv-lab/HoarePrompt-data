Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, an integer m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, a = test_cases[_]
    freq = [0] * 7
    for prob in a:
        freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
    missing = sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)
    results.append(missing)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, an integer `m` such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the _-th tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the _-th tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the _-th tuple in `test_cases`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in freq.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of the `i-th` letter ('A' + i) in the string `a`; `missing` is the sum of `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`; `results` now includes `missing` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of the character corresponding to `chr(i + ord('A'))` in `a`; `missing` is the sum of `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`; `results` now includes the newly calculated `missing` as its last element; `t` is decremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from `test_cases[_]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
