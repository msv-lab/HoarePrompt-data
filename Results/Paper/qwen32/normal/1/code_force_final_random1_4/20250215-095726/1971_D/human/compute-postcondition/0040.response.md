Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with at least one character; `count` is 2; `flag` is True; `j` is 0; `i` is `i+1` where `i` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration; the character at position `j` in `s` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` in `s` is '1'.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that the variable `flag` has been set to `True`. All other variables retain their previous values.
