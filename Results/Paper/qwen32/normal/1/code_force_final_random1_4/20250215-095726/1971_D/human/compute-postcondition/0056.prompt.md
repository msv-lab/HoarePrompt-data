Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the new input string; `count` is 1; `flag` is False; `j` is 0; `i` is `i+1` where `i` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
Code of the loop:
while j < len(s) - 1:
    if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
        count += 1
        if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
            flag = True
    j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with at least one character; `j` is 1; `i` is `i+1` where `i` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If the character at position `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1`, then `count` is 2 and `flag` is True if the character at position `j` in `s` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` in `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with at least 3 characters; `j` is `j+1`; `i` is `i+1` where `i` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration; `count` is incremented by 1 if the character at position `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1`, and set to 3 if the character at position `j` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` is '1'; `flag` is True if the character at position `j` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with at least 3 characters; `j` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `len(s) - 2`; `i` is `i+1`; `count` is incremented by 1 if the character at the new position `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1`, and set to 3 if the character at the new position `j` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` is '1'; additionally, if the character at the new position `j` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` is '1', `count` is further incremented by 1 and `flag` is set to True; otherwise, `flag` remains False.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
