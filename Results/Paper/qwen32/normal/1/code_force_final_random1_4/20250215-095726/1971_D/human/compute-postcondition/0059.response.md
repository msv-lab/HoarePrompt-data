Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string; `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in `s` plus 1, now decreased by 1 if `flag` is True; `flag` is True if there is at least one '01' pattern in `s`; `j` is `len(s) - 1`; `i` is `i+1` where `i` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
