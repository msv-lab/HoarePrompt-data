Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string with length at least 3; `count` is either 2 or 3; `flag` is True if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 1. Specifically, if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', then `flag` is True.**
