The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and it remains within the range of 1 to 500 as specified in the initial state. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' such that 1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 500.**
