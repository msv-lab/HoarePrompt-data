The value of `g` is assigned the integer division of `n` by `count`. Given that `count` is initially 2, `g` will be `n // 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n // 2`.**
