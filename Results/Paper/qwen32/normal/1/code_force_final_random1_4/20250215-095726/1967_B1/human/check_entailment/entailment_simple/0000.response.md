### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Analysis of the Code:
The code iterates through each test case, reading \(n\) and \(m\). It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.

For each iteration:
- `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
- `g` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `count`.
- If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
- Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
- `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `g` by `count` plus 1.
- `count` is incremented by 1.

Finally, the value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

#### Issues with the Code:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The code initializes `ans` to `n`. This implies that it assumes every pair where `b = 1` is valid, which is not necessarily true. We need to verify this assumption.
2. **Loop Logic:** The logic inside the loop seems to be attempting to count valid pairs for `b > 1`, but the way it calculates `g` and adjusts it doesn't align with the problem's requirements.
3. **Condition Check:** The condition `if g < countmins` and how `g` is adjusted doesn't properly reflect the requirement that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

#### Verification Against Sample Input:
Let's check the first few test cases manually:
- For `n = 1, m = 1`: Only `(1, 1)` works, so the output should be `1`.
- For `n = 2, m = 3`: Valid pairs are `(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2)`, so the output should be `3`.
- For `n = 3, m = 5`: Valid pairs are `(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)`, so the output should be `4`.

The code does not seem to produce these results correctly based on the provided logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the initialization of `ans` and the logic inside the loop, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
