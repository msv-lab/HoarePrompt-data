Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two positive integers `n` and `m`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, which is not specified in detail here but could involve some computation or comparison based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
