You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m`. It then computes and prints a specific value `ans` for each test case based on the given logic involving `n` and `m`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations
1. If \(b = 1\), then \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\). So, \(a + 1\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1\), which is always true. Hence, for every \(a\) from 1 to \(n\), the pair \((a, 1)\) is valid. This gives us \(n\) valid pairs when \(b = 1\).
2. For \(b > 1\), we need \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\). Then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes \(dx + dy\) is a multiple of \(dy \cdot d = d^2y\). Simplifying, we get \(x + y\) must be a multiple of \(dy\).

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution initializes `count` to 2 (since \(b = 1\) is handled separately) and iterates over possible values of \(b\). For each \(b\), it calculates how many valid \(a\) values exist.

#### Steps in the Code:
1. Initialize `count` to 2 (since \(b = 1\) is already counted).
2. For each \(b\) from 2 to \(m\):
   - Calculate `countmins` as \(b - 1\).
   - Calculate `g` as the integer division of \(n\) by \(b\).
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, break the loop (since no valid \(a\) can exist).
   - Otherwise, subtract `countmins` from `g` and add the result of integer division of `g` by `b` plus 1 to the answer.
3. Print the final answer for each test case.

### Issues in the Provided Solution
The provided solution does not correctly account for the condition that \(x + y\) must be a multiple of \(dy\). It incorrectly assumes that the number of valid \(a\) values can be calculated simply by dividing \(n\) by \(b\) and adjusting for multiples, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) and for each \(b\), iterate over possible values of \(a\) to check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This approach is more computationally intensive but ensures correctness.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the provided solution, it is incorrect for the problem at hand.
