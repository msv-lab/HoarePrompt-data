Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + n // 4`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n // 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
