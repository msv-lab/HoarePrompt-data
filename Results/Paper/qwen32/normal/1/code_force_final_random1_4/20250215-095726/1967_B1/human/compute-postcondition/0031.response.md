To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the initial state provided and the code snippet. However, the initial state does not specify any details about the variable `ans`. Without knowing the value of `ans`, we cannot determine the exact output of `int(ans)`.

Given the lack of specific information about `ans`, we can only describe the output in terms of `ans`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The code snippet contains a `print` statement that converts `ans` to an integer using `int(ans)` and then prints it.
2. Since there is no information about the value of `ans` in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact integer value that will be printed.
3. Therefore, the output will be the integer representation of whatever value `ans` holds.

Thus, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **int(ans) (where ans is the value of the variable ans)**
