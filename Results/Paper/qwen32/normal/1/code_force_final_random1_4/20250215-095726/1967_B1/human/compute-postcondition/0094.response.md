To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it evolves with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
- The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case (each iteration of the outer loop), two integers `n` and `m` are read.
- An inner loop calculates a value `ans` based on the given logic and prints it.

### Variables:
- `t`: Number of test cases.
- `i`: Loop variable for the outer loop, ranging from `0` to `t-1`.
- `n`, `m`: Input integers for each test case.
- `count`: Initialized to `2` and increments until it exceeds `m`.
- `ans`: Accumulated sum calculated in the inner loop.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the loop variable `i` will have completed its range, meaning `i` will be equal to `t`. All test cases will have been processed, and the corresponding `ans` values will have been printed.

### Output State Description:
- `i` will be equal to `t` because the loop has run `t` times.
- `t` remains unchanged as it is the total number of test cases.
- `n` and `m` will be the values from the last test case processed.
- `count` will be `m + 1` for the last test case, as the inner loop increments `count` until it exceeds `m`.
- `ans` will be the final accumulated sum for the last test case.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`i` is equal to `t`, `t` remains the same, `n` and `m` are the values from the last test case, `count` is `m + 1` for the last test case, `ans` is the final accumulated sum for the last test case.**

This means that after all iterations, the loop variable `i` will have reached `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed, and the variables `n`, `m`, `count`, and `ans` will reflect the state of the last test case.
