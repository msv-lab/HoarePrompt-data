To determine the new output state, we need to focus on the line of code that modifies the existing variables:

```python
ans += int(g / count) + 1
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than 4
- `count` is 4
- `ans` is `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 2`
- `countmins` is 3
- `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3` if `int(n / 4) >= 3`, otherwise `g` is `int(n / 4)`

Let's break down the changes:
- `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value.

Since `count` is 4, the expression simplifies to `int(g / 4) + 1`.

Thus, the new value of `ans` will be:
\[ \text{new\_ans} = \text{ans} + \left(\left\lfloor \frac{g}{4} \right\rfloor + 1\right) \]

Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than 4; `count` is 4; `ans` is `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 2 + int(g / 4) + 1`; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3` if `int(n / 4) >= 3`, otherwise `g` is `int(n / 4)`**.
