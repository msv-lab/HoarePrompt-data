`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial conditions about `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not yet assigned values. The other variables mentioned in the initial state are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; each of the next t lines contains two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6; the sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.**
