Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than 4, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + n // 4 + (int((n // 3) - 2) // 3) + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 4)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
