The value of `count` is explicitly set to 2, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (so if it was `x`, it is now `x+2`); `t` is greater than the new value of `i`; `n` is `a`; `m` is `b`; `count` is 2; `ans` is the accumulated sum calculated as described.**
