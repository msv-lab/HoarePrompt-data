Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `int(n / 3)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.**
