To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `ans += int(g / count) + 1` given the initial state of the variables.

Given:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `t` is greater than the new value of `i`.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is greater than 4.
- `count` is 4.
- `ans` is `n + n // 4 + (int((n // 3) - 2) // 3) + 1`.
- `countmins` is 3.
- `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`.

The expression to evaluate is:
```python
ans += int(g / count) + 1
```

First, let's express `g` in terms of `n`:
```python
g = int(n / 4) - 3
```

Next, we substitute `g` into the expression:
```python
ans += int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1
```

Let's denote the new value of `ans` as `ans_new`:
```python
ans_new = ans + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1
```

Since `ans` was initially `n + n // 4 + (int((n // 3) - 2) // 3) + 1`, we can write:
```python
ans_new = n + n // 4 + (int((n // 3) - 2) // 3) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1
```

Simplifying the expression:
```python
ans_new = n + n // 4 + (int((n // 3) - 2) // 3) + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 2
```

Thus, the new value of `ans` is calculated as above. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than 4, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + n // 4 + (int((n // 3) - 2) // 3) + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 2`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`.**
