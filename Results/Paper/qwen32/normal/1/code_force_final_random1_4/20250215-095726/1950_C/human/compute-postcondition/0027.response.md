To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1439.
- `s` is the new input string.
- `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(h, end='')
```

### Explanation:
- The variable `h` is defined as the first two characters of the string `s`.
- The `print` function is used with the `end=''` argument, which means it will print the value of `h` without adding a newline character at the end.

### Output:
The output will be the first two characters of the string `s`.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific characters that will be printed. However, based on the given information, we know that `h` will always be the first two characters of the string `s`.

Thus, the output will be the first two characters of the input string `s`.

Output: **h (where h is the first two characters of the string s)**
