Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440; `s` is the input string; `h` is the first two characters of `s`. If `h` equals '00', then `h` remains '00'. Otherwise, `h` is not equal to '00', and if the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, `h` remains unchanged. If the integer value of `h` is greater than 12, `h` is greater than 12.**
