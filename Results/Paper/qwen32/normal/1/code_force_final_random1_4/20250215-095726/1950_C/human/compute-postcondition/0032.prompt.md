Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string s of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" where hh is a string representing the hour from "00" to "23" and mm is a string representing the minute from "00" to "59".
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    h = s[:2]
    if h == '00':
        print('12', end='')
    elif int(h) <= 12:
        print(h, end='')
    else:
        print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
    print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440; `s` is the input string; `h` is the first two characters of `s`. If `h` equals '00', then `h` remains '00'. Otherwise, `h` is not equal to '00', and if the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, `h` remains unchanged. If the integer value of `h` is greater than 12, `h` is greater than 12.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1440; `s` is `input_string`; `h` is the first two characters of `s`. If `h` equals '00', then `h` remains '00'. Otherwise, `h` remains unchanged regardless of whether the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12 or greater than 12.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1439; `s` is the new input string; `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`. The conditions remain unchanged regardless of the value of `h`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
