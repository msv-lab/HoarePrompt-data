Let's break down the given Python code snippet and determine what it will print based on the initial state:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1439.
- `s` is the new input string.
- `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Extracting Substring from `s`:**
   - `s[2:]` extracts the substring of `s` starting from the third character (index 2) to the end of the string.

2. **Determining AM/PM:**
   - `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` uses a list indexing technique to decide between 'AM' and 'PM'.
   - `int(h) >= 12` evaluates to a boolean value (`True` or `False`).
     - If `h` (the first two characters of `s`) is a number greater than or equal to 12, `int(h) >= 12` is `True`.
     - If `h` is a number less than 12, `int(h) >= 12` is `False`.
   - In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`.
     - Therefore, if `int(h) >= 12` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `['AM', 'PM'][1]`, which is `'PM'`.
     - If `int(h) >= 12` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `['AM', 'PM'][0]`, which is `'AM'`.

### Final Output Description:
- The code prints the substring of `s` starting from the third character, followed by either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of the first two characters of `s`.

### Output:
Output: **substring of `s` starting from the third character, followed by 'AM' if the first two characters of `s` are less than 12, otherwise 'PM'**.
