### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing exactly one cube.

Here's the breakdown of the conditions in the program:

1. **if n == m:** This condition checks if the number of moves `n` is equal to the desired number of cubes `m`. If they are equal, it means that all `n` moves could be additions, resulting in `m` cubes. This condition is correct.

2. **elif m > n:** This condition checks if the desired number of cubes `m` is greater than the number of moves `n`. Since each move can add at most one cube, it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves. This condition is also correct.

3. **elif m == n - 1:** This condition checks if the desired number of cubes `m` is one less than the number of moves `n`. This implies that `n-1` moves could be additions and one move could be a removal, resulting in `m` cubes. This condition is correct.

4. **elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:** This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are even. If both are even, it's possible to reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes in `n` moves by having an equal number of additions and removals (since the net effect of an addition followed by a removal is zero, and vice versa). This condition is correct.

5. **elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:** This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. If both are odd, it's possible to reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes in `n` moves because the net effect of an odd number of additions and removals can result in an odd number of cubes. This condition is correct.

6. **else:** If none of the above conditions are met, the program outputs "No". This covers all other scenarios where it's not possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the conditions `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` are overly restrictive and do not cover all valid cases. Specifically, they don't account for scenarios where the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is sufficient to allow reaching `m` cubes from 0 cubes in `n` moves.

A simpler and more accurate approach would be to check if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even, which covers all valid scenarios:

```python
if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

Given the current implementation, the conditions are not comprehensive enough to cover all valid scenarios, making the program incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
