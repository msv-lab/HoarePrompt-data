To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:

Nikita can perform two types of operations:
1. Add one cube to the tower.
2. Remove one cube from the tower.

Given `n` moves, we need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes in the tower.

### Key Observations:
- If `n < m`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes because we cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `n >= m`, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because:
  - We can add cubes until we reach `m`.
  - Then, for the remaining moves `(n - m)`, we can alternate between adding and removing cubes, which keeps the number of cubes unchanged if `(n - m)` is even.
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m)` is odd, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes because we would end up with either `m + 1` or `m - 1` cubes after the last move.

### Program Analysis:

Let's review the conditions in the program:

1. `if n == m:`  
   - This condition is correct. If `n` equals `m`, then it's trivially possible to end up with `m` cubes by adding one cube per move.
   
2. `elif m > n:`  
   - This condition is correct. If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes because we cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
   
3. `elif m == n - 1:`  
   - This condition is incorrect. Having `m == n - 1` does not guarantee that it's possible to end up with `m` cubes. It should be checked whether `(n - m)` is even.
   
4. `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:`  
   - This condition is incorrect. It checks for both `m` and `n` being even, which is not sufficient to determine if `(n - m)` is even.
   
5. `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:`  
   - This condition is incorrect. It checks for both `m` and `n` being odd, which is not sufficient to determine if `(n - m)` is even.
   
6. `else:`  
   - This condition is correct in the sense that it handles cases not covered by the previous conditions, but it should be used to check if `(n - m)` is even when `n >= m`.

### Correct Implementation:

A correct implementation should check if `n >= m` and if `(n - m)` is even:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the conditions.

**Correctness: False**
