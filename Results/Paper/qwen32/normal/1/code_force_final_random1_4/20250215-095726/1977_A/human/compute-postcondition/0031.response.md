In the given initial state, several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`) are described, but they do not influence the execution of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables. It simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `m` is the second integer from the input.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('No')` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`.
   - It directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'No'`.

Output: **No**
