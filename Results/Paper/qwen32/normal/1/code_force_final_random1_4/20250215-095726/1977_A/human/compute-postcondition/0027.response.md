The `print` statement in the given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **No**
