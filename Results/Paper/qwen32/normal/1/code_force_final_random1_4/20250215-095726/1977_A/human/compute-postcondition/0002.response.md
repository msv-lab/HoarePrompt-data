The code reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
