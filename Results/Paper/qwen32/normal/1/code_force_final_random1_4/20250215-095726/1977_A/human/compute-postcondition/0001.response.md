To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(t):`, which means the only variable we can adjust directly is `i` and the value of `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop control variable and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` since it will be automatically set to 0 by the `range` function. The only requirement is that `t` should be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 0**
