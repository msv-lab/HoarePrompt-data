You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `t - 1`, and for each of the `t` test cases, the program has printed 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions provided in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions related to the parity and values of `n` and `m`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move consists of either adding or removing exactly 1 cube.
- Output "Yes" if it's possible, otherwise "No".

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves:

1. If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
2. If `m > n`, it prints "No".
3. If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
6. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Finding Edge Cases:
Let's consider some edge cases and see if the program handles them correctly:

1. **Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `n == m`.

2. **Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - The program correctly outputs "No" because `m > n`.

3. **Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 2`, which is allowed by adding and removing cubes.

4. **Case 4:** `n = 4`, `m = 2`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 2`, which is allowed by adding and removing cubes.

5. **Case 5:** `n = 5`, `m = 1`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 4`, which is allowed by adding and removing cubes.

6. **Case 6:** `n = 6`, `m = 0`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 6`, which is allowed by adding and removing cubes.

7. **Case 7:** `n = 5`, `m = 4`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 1`, which is directly handled by the condition `elif m == n - 1:`.

8. **Case 8:** `n = 4`, `m = 1`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 3`, which is allowed by adding and removing cubes.

9. **Case 9:** `n = 3`, `m = 0`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 3`, which is allowed by adding and removing cubes.

10. **Case 10:** `n = 2`, `m = 1`
    - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 1`, which is directly handled by the condition `elif m == n - 1:`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the provided test cases and edge cases, it appears that the program correctly determines whether it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic covers all necessary scenarios, including when `m` is less than, equal to, or greater than `n`, and it correctly handles both even and odd values of `m` and `n`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
