Let's carefully re-evaluate the program using the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary. We'll check if the program correctly handles all possible scenarios.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move consists of either adding or removing exactly 1 cube.
- Output "Yes" if it's possible, otherwise "No".

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves:

1. If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
2. If `m > n`, it prints "No".
3. If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
6. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Key Observations:
- The program correctly handles the cases where `n == m` and `m > n`.
- The program correctly handles the case where `m == n - 1`.
- However, the conditions for handling even and odd values of `m` and `n` are not sufficient to cover all scenarios.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
- `n = 4`, `m = 2`

According to the problem description, it is possible to end up with 2 cubes after 4 moves by performing the following sequence of operations:
1. Add a cube (1 cube)
2. Add another cube (2 cubes)
3. Remove a cube (1 cube)
4. Add a cube (2 cubes)

Thus, the correct output should be "Yes". However, let's see how the program handles this case:
- `n = 4` (even), `m = 2` (even)
- The program will print "Yes" based on the condition `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:`

This specific case works, but let's consider another one:
- `n = 5`, `m = 2`

Here, it is impossible to end up with 2 cubes after 5 moves because the parity of the number of cubes will always be the same as the parity of the number of moves (since each move changes the parity). Since `n` is odd and `m` is even, it is impossible to achieve this configuration.

However, the program will print "Yes" based on the condition `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` (which does not apply here, but the logic for even/odd parity is flawed).

### Correct Logic:
To correctly determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves:
- If `m > n`, it's impossible (`print("No")`).
- If `|n - m|` is even, it's possible (`print("Yes")`), because we can balance the number of additions and removals.
- If `|n - m|` is odd, it's impossible (`print("No")`), because the parity of the number of cubes will not match.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if m > n:
            print('No')
        elif (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program incorrectly handles the cases where `|n - m|` is odd. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
