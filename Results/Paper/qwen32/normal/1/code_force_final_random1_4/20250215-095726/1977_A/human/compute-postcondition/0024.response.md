The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. Specifically, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` do not change within the loop head.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `m` is the second integer from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. If `n` is not equal to `m`, the following conditions apply: if `m` is greater than `n`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and either `m` equals `n - 1` or both `m` and `n` are even, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, at least one of `m` or `n` is odd.**
