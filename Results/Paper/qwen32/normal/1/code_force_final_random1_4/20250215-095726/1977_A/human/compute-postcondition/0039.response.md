The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`), but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement.

Thus, the `print('Yes')` statement will simply output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
