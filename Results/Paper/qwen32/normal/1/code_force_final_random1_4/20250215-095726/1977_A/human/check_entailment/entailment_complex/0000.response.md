### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube at a time. This means that after `n` moves, the number of cubes `m` in the tower can be any value from `0` to `n` if we consider all possible sequences of adding and removing cubes. However, the key point is that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even because every addition and removal operation changes the number of cubes by 1, thus changing its parity (odd/even nature).

Here's a breakdown of the conditions in the code:

1. `if n == m:` 
   - If the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's possible to just keep adding cubes without any removals. This condition is correct.

2. `elif m > n:` 
   - If the number of cubes `m` is greater than the number of moves `n`, it's impossible to have more cubes than moves since each move can add at most one cube. This condition is correct.

3. `elif m == n - 1:` 
   - If the number of cubes `m` is one less than the number of moves `n`, it's possible to add `n-1` cubes and then remove one cube. This condition is correct.

4. `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` 
   - If both `m` and `n` are even, it's possible to reach `m` cubes in `n` moves because the difference `n - m` is even, and we can balance additions and removals accordingly. This condition is correct.

5. `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` 
   - If both `m` and `n` are odd, it's also possible to reach `m` cubes in `n` moves because the difference `n - m` is even, and we can balance additions and removals accordingly. This condition is correct.

6. `else:`
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it implies that `m` and `n` have different parities and their difference is odd, which means it's impossible to reach `m` cubes in `n` moves. This condition is correct.

However, the third condition (`elif m == n - 1:`) is redundant because it is already covered by the general rule that the difference `n - m` must be even. Therefore, the program logic is mostly correct but includes unnecessary redundancy.

### Conclusion:
Despite the redundancy, the program correctly determines whether it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity of `n` and `m` and their difference. The core logic is sound.

**Correctness: True**
