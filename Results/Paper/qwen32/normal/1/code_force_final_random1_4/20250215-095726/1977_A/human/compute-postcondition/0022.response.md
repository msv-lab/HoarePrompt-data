Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, and `n` is not equal to `m`. If `m` is greater than `n`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, if `m` is less than or equal to `n`, the conditions specified in the else part hold. Specifically, if `m` equals `n - 1`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. If both `m` and `n` are even, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, at least one of `m` or `n` is odd.**
