To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive).
   - `n`: An integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive).
   - `k`: An integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive).
   - `m`: An integer between 1 and 1,000 (inclusive).
   - `s`: A non-empty string.
   - `i`: Set to `k-1`.
   - `cur`: Bitwise representation of unique characters seen in the last incomplete set (or 0 if complete).
   - `cnt`: Number of times `k` unique characters were seen consecutively, and it is less than `n`.
   - `tmp`: Remains unchanged (not used in the print statement).
   - `ans`: Concatenation of its previous value and `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is initially constructed by concatenating its previous value with a string of `'a'` characters repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.
   - Since `cnt` is less than `n`, `(n - cnt - 1)` is a non-negative integer.

3. **What gets printed:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the current value of `ans`.

Given the initial state, we know that `ans` is built up over time by appending `'a'` characters based on the formula `(n - cnt - 1)`. However, without knowing the exact values of `n`, `cnt`, and the initial state of `ans`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be a string consisting of the initial value of `ans` concatenated with a certain number of `'a'` characters, where the number of `'a'` characters is determined by `(n - cnt - 1)`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the concatenation of its previous value and 'a' * (n - cnt - 1))**
