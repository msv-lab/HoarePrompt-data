The code snippet provided only increments the variable `cnt` by 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `cur_ss`, `cur`, `ans`, `ss`) are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cur` is unchanged, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `ans` is unchanged, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**
