Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur` is 0, and `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `cur` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
