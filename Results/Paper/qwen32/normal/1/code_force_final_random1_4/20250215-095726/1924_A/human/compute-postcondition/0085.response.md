The given code snippet increments the variable `cnt` by 1. None of the other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26
- `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000
- `s` is a non-empty string read from the input
- `cnt` is either 0 or 1
- `ans` is either '' or `s[1]`
- `tmp` is an empty string
- `i` is 1
- `cur_ss` is `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`
- `ss` is `s[2]`
- If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`

After executing `cnt += 1`, the value of `cnt` changes from either 0 or 1 to either 1 or 2 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is either '' or `s[1]`, `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`, `ss` is `s[2]`**
