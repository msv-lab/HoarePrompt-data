Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `ans` is either '' or `s[1]` or `s[1] + s[2]`, `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`, `ss` is `s[2]`. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `s[1] + s[2]`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 or 1 and `ans` remains either '' or `s[1]`.**
