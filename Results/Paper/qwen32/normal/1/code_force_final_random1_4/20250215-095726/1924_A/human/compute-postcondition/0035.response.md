Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and their roles:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5.
- `n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
- `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `cnt` is the count of how many times all `k` characters have appeared in any order within the string `s`.
- `cur` is either 0 (indicating a complete set of `k` characters) or reflects an incomplete set of characters.
- `ans` is the last character that completed a set of `k` characters.
- `cnt` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `n`.

The Python code snippet provided is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
