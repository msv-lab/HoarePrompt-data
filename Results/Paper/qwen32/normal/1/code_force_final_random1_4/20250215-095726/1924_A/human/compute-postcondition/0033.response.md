To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, updating the `cur` bitmask to track which characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets have been seen. When `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, it indicates that all `k` characters have been seen at least once, and `cnt` is incremented while `cur` is reset to 0. The variable `ans` accumulates the last character `ss` when `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`.

Let's break down the final state step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5 (unchanged).
   - `n` and `k`: Integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26 (unchanged).
   - `m`: An integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000 (unchanged).
   - `s`: A string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets (unchanged).
   - `cnt`: 0 (initially).
   - `cur`: 0 (initially).
   - `ans`: An empty string (initially).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each character `ss` in `s`, compute `cur_ss` as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
   - If the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set (`cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`), set it (`cur += 1 << cur_ss`).
   - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1` (all `k` characters have been seen), increment `cnt` by 1, reset `cur` to 0, and append `ss` to `ans`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` will hold the number of times all `k` characters were seen consecutively in any order.
   - `cur` will be 0 unless the last sequence of characters did not complete a full set of `k` characters.
   - `ans` will contain the last character `ss` that completed a set of `k` characters.

Given the above understanding, the final state after all iterations can be described as follows:

- `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- `cnt` reflects the total number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`.
- `cur` will be 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters; otherwise, it will reflect the incomplete set.
- `ans` will be the last character `ss` that completed a set of `k` characters.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, n and k are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, m is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, s is a new string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times all k characters were seen in any order within the string s, cur is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of k characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, ans is the last character ss that completed a set of k characters.**
