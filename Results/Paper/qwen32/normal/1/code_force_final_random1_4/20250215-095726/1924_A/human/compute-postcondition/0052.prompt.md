Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, n and k are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, m is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, s is a new string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times all k characters were seen in any order within the string s, cnt is less than n, cur is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of k characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, ans is the last character ss that completed a set of k characters, tmp is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, `ans` is the last character `ss` that completed a set of `k` characters, `tmp` is `'a'` if `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` is true, `i` is 0, and the `break` statement was encountered. If `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` is false, `tmp` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, `ans` is the last character `ss` that completed a set of `k` characters, `tmp` is 'b' if `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` is true, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, `ans` is the last character `ss` that completed a set of `k` characters, `i` is `i + 1`. If `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` is true, then `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + i)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
