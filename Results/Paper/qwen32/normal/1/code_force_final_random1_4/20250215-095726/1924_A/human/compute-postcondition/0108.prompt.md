Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is an empty string; `i` remains 1; `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is 'b' if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is not set, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string; `i` remains 1; `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters; `i` is 2; `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is not set, `tmp` is 'c' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters; `i` is 3; `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is not set, `tmp` is 'd' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
