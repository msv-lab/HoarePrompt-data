Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is an empty string; `i` remains 1; `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters; the condition `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` holds true, meaning the `i`-th bit of `cur` is not set**
