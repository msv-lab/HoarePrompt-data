The given code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp` by converting an ASCII value to a character. Specifically, it sets `tmp` to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the calculation proceeds as follows:

- `ord('a')` gives the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97.
- Adding `i` (which is 3) to 97 results in 100.
- `chr(100)` converts the ASCII value 100 back to the character 'd'.

Thus, `tmp` is set to 'd'. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters; `i` is 3; `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters; `tmp` is 'd'.**
