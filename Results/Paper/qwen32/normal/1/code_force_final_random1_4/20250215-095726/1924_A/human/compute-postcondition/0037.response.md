Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5.
- `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 26.
- `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `cnt` is the number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete set.
- `ans` is the last character that completed a set of `k` characters.

The `print('NO')` statement is straightforward. It does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, or `ans`. The statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
