The code assigns the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the value of `i` to the variable `tmp`. Given that `i` is 0, `tmp` will be assigned the character 'a'.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
- `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is 0.
- `cur` is the bitwise representation of the unique characters seen in the last incomplete set (or 0 if complete).
- `cnt` is the number of times k unique characters were seen consecutively and `cnt` is less than n.
- `tmp` is now 'a'.
- The bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `cur` is the bitwise representation of the unique characters seen in the last incomplete set (or 0 if complete), `cnt` is the number of times k unique characters were seen consecutively and `cnt` is less than n, `tmp` is 'a', and the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0.**
