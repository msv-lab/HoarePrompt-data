The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
- `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
- `s` is a new string of length `m` (where `m` >= 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` representing the 0-based index of `ss` in the alphabet.
- If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `ans` remains an empty string, and `cur` remains unchanged.

At the end of the last iteration, `ss` was the current character being processed in the string `s`. To move to the next iteration, `ss` should be updated to the next character in the string `s`.

Let's denote the current position of `ss` in the string `s` as `position`. After the last iteration, `position` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `ss` should be the character at `position + 1` in the string `s`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `position` or the current `ss` from the previous iteration, we can only describe the state in terms of the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` (where `m` >= 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` representing the 0-based index of the new `ss` in the alphabet. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `ans` remains an empty string, and `cur` remains unchanged.**
