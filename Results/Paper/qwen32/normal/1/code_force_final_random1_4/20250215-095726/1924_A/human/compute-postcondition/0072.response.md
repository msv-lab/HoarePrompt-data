Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is '', `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.**
