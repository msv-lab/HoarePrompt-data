The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust only the value of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given that the loop iterates over `range(k)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

Other variables like `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `tmp`, and `cur` should remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is 'b' if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is not set, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string; `i` is 2; `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters.**
