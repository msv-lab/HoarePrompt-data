The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `ss` to the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26
- `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000
- `s` is a non-empty string read from the input
- `cnt` is either 0 or 1
- `ans` is ''
- `tmp` is an empty string
- `i` is 1
- `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`
- If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was `s[0]`. For the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is '', `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`, `ss` is `s[1]`**
