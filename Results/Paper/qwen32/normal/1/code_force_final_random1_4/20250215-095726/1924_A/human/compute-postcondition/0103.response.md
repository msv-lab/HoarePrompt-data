Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters; `i` is 2; `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is not set, `tmp` is 'c' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.**
