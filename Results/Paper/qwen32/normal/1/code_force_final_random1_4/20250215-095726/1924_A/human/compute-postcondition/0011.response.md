Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length m (where m >= 1) consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and k-1 representing the 0-based index of `ss` in the alphabet. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
