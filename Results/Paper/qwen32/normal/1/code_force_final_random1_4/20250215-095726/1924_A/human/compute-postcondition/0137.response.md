The only variable in the loop head is `ss`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the current character `ss`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ss` was the current character from the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ss` should be updated to the next character in the string `s`.

Here's how we adjust the state:

- `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `i`, `cur_ss`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated to include `ss`. Otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**
