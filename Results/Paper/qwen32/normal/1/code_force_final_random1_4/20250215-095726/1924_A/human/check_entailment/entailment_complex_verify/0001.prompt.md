You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: t is 0, n and k are integers from the last test case such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, m is an integer from the last test case such that 1 <= m <= 1000, s is the string from the last test case, cnt is the number of sequences of k unique characters found in the last test case, cur is the bitmask representing the current set of unique characters in the last test case, and ans is the final constructed string based on the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. It checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` sequences of `k` unique characters. If it does, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` that includes the missing characters to meet the requirement, followed by additional 'a' characters to reach the count `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
- If not, we must provide one such string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Provided Program Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Logic to Check Subsequences**:
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of complete subsequences found.
   - `cur` is used as a bitmask to track which characters have been seen in the current subsequence.
   - `ans` is initialized to store the constructed string (though its usage is unclear in this context).

3. **Processing Each Character in `s`**:
   - For each character `ss` in `s`, it calculates the bit position `cur_ss` corresponding to the character.
   - It checks if the character has already been seen in the current subsequence using the bitmask `cur`.
   - If not, it updates the bitmask `cur` to include the character.
   - If all `k` characters have been seen (`cur == (1 << k) - 1`), it increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.

4. **Checking the Count**:
   - If `cnt` is at least `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and attempts to construct a missing subsequence.

5. **Constructing a Missing Subsequence**:
   - It tries to find a character that hasn't been seen in the last incomplete subsequence and adds it to `tmp`.
   - It appends `tmp` and `n - cnt - 1` 'a's to `ans` and prints it.

### Issues in the Program
- The logic to check if all subsequences are present is flawed. The bitmask approach is intended to track the presence of characters, but it doesn't correctly account for subsequences of length `n`.
- The construction of the missing subsequence is also incorrect. It doesn't ensure that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s` and doesn't guarantee that it is of length `n`.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
