The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by shifting the number 1 to the left by `cur_ss` positions in binary representation. This effectively adds \(2^{\text{cur\_ss}}\) to `cur`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cur` equals its previous value plus \(2^{\text{cur\_ss}}\), `cnt` is 1 if `cur` was `(1 << k) - 1` otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `ans` is a string containing the value of `ss` if `cur` was `(1 << k) - 1` otherwise `ans` remains an empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**
