The given code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp`. Specifically, it sets `tmp` to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the current value of `i`.

Given that `i` is initially 2, the calculation for `tmp` would be:
- `ord('a')` gives the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97.
- Adding `i` (which is 2) to this value results in 99.
- `chr(99)` converts this ASCII value back to the character 'c'.

Therefore, `tmp` is now 'c'. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `cur` is the bitwise representation of the unique characters seen in the last incomplete set (or 0 if complete), `cnt` is the number of times k unique characters were seen consecutively and `cnt` is less than n, `tmp` is 'c'.**
