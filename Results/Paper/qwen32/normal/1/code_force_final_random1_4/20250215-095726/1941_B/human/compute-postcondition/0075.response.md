Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` and `a[n-1]` are adjusted based on previous operations, and `stop` is True indicating that at least one `a[i]` was negative during the loop.**
