Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine whether all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. The conditions checked in the program do not cover the necessary criteria for solving the problem.

To solve the problem, we need to consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the elements in the array and how the operations affect these parities. Specifically, the operations always decrease the values at three consecutive positions by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. This means that the parity of the elements at positions i-1, i, and i+1 changes in a specific way with each operation.

A key insight is that the parity of the first and last elements must be such that they can be reduced to zero through a series of operations that maintain the constraints of the problem. However, the provided program only checks the parity and value relationship between the first two and the last two elements, which is insufficient to guarantee that the entire array can be reduced to zeros.

Therefore, the logic in the program is flawed, and it does not correctly determine the possibility of making all elements of the array zero.

Correctness: **False**
