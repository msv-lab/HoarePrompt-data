The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is the newly input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input.

Since the `print` statement is `print('YES')`, it directly outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Output: **YES**
