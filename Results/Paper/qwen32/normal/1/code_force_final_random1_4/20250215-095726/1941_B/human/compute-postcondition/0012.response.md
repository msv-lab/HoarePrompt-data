Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is the newly input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
