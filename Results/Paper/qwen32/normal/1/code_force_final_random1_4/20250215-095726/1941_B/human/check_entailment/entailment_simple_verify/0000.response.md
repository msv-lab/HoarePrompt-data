### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine if we can reduce all elements of the array to zero using the specified operation:
- Choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)).
- Perform the following changes:
  - \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
  - \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
  - \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)

This operation effectively reduces the value at \( a_i \) by 2 and the values at \( a_{i-1} \) and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1 each.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Parity Constraints**: Notice that the operation always decreases the total sum of the array by 4. Therefore, if the initial sum of the array is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to reduce the array to all zeros.
2. **Specific Conditions**: The provided program checks specific conditions related to the first and last elements of the array. However, these conditions alone are insufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zero.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program checks:
- If the first element \( b[0] \) is odd and the second element \( b[1] \) is not equal to \( b[0] + 2 \).
- If the last element \( b[-1] \) is odd and the second-to-last element \( b[-2] \) is not equal to \( b[-1] + 2 \).

If either of these conditions is true, the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

#### Evaluation Using Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the program checks the conditions mentioned above and prints "NO" or "YES" accordingly. However, these conditions do not cover all necessary cases to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zero.

#### Counterexample:
The original assessment provides a counterexample:
- Input: `1 5 1 2 3 2 1`
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Explanation: The program would output "YES" because neither of the checked conditions is met, but it is impossible to reduce the array to all zeros due to the middle element `3`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The logic is too simplistic and does not account for the entire array and the operations that can be performed on it.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
