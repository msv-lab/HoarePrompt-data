Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is `numTest + 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is `-opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, and `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`, either `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0, or both are 0, `opNum` is assigned the value of `a[i]` (which was the original value before the operation), `i` is `i + 1`, `stop` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the current loop or if statement without changing the values of the variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their pre-execution values except that the program execution will terminate the loop or if statement it is currently in.
