Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the newly input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input. The program does not modify `t`, `a`, or `b` regardless of whether the condition `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2)` is true or false.**
