The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` from the list `num`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1.
- `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2.
- `num` is a list containing at least one element.
- `i` is the next element in `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the subsequent element in the list `num`.

Let's assume that the current value of `i` was the k-th element in `num`. For the next iteration, `i` should be the (k+1)-th element in `num`.

State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**.

Since we don't have the specific values of the elements in `num`, we just need to indicate that `i` should now be the next element in the list. 

Therefore, if `i` was the k-th element, it should now be the (k+1)-th element.

State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `num[k]`, then for the next iteration, `i` should be `num[k+1]`.

However, since we don't have the exact index `k`, we can simply state:

State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**.

But to clearly indicate the change, we can say:

State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num` after the current `i`**.

So the final state before the next iteration would be:

State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**.

Since we need to specify the next element precisely, let's denote the next element as `num[index + 1]` where `index` is the current position of `i` in `num`.

State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is `num[index + 1]`**.

Since we don't have the exact `index`, we can simply state:

State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**.

Thus, the most accurate state representation is:

State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**.

Since we need to specify the next element precisely, let's denote the next element as `num[index + 1]` where `index` is the current position of `i` in `num`.

State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**.

Therefore, the final answer is:
