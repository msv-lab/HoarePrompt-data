### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify that the logic implemented in the functions aligns with the problem requirements. Here's a breakdown of the key functionalities and their relevance to the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`:** This function reads the number of test cases. It correctly reads an integer from the input when `isOne` is `False`, which is appropriate for reading the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Function `func_2`:** This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. While this function is useful for parsing input, it is not directly used in the provided code snippet. However, it seems to be a utility function that could be used elsewhere in the program.

3. **Function `func_3`:** This function concatenates a list of elements into a single string with a specified separator. This function is not used in the provided code snippet and seems to be a utility function for formatting output, which is not needed here.

4. **Function `func_4`:** This function finds all occurrences of a substring within a string. This function is not used in the provided code snippet and seems to be a utility function for string manipulation, which is not needed here.

5. **Function `func_5`:** This function finds all indices of a specific element in a list. This function is not used in the provided code snippet and seems to be a utility function for list manipulation, which is not needed here.

6. **Function `func_6`:** This function searches for a sublist within a list of lists based on a specific value at a given index. This function is not used in the provided code snippet and seems to be a utility function for searching within nested lists, which is not needed here.

7. **Function `func_7`:** This function is central to solving the problem. It reads the constraints for each test case, determines the valid range for `k` based on constraints of type 1 and 2, and counts how many integers within this range do not violate constraints of type 3. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its logic:
   - It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000.
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (k ≥ x), it updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (k ≤ x), it updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (k ≠ x), it adds `x` to a list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it counts how many numbers in the range `[start, end]` are in the list `num`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0 because the range is invalid.
   - Otherwise, it returns the size of the valid range minus the count of numbers that are not allowed (`end - start + 1 - count_num`).

### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_7` correctly implements the solution to the problem by determining the valid range for `k` and accounting for the constraints of type 3. Since `func_7` is the only function directly involved in solving the problem and it performs the necessary calculations accurately, the program is correct.

**Correctness:** **True**
