To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration includes `n`, `t`, `start`, `num`, and `end`.
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`.

From the problem statement, we know:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `i` is the loop variable that increments by 1 with each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on a value from 0 up to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n`.

Let's break down the adjustments needed:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where 0 <= k < n).
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` does not change during the loop iterations; it remains constant throughout the loop.

Since the problem specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `n`), and `n` remains unchanged, we only need to increment `i` by 1.

Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Given that the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize this by saying that `i` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer, `start` is the second integer from the input if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` is 3, `start` is -1, `num` is a list containing `v`, and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 3, `num` remains an empty list and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can simply say:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer, `start` is the second integer from the input if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` is 3, `start` is -1, `num` is a list containing `v`, and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 3, `num` remains an empty list and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For simplicity and clarity, if we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer, `start` is the second integer from the input if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` is 3, `start` is -1, `num` is a list containing `v`, and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 3, `num` remains an empty list and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`, `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can generalize:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer, `start` is the second integer from the input if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` is 3, `start` is -1, `num` is a list containing `v`, and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 3, `num` remains an empty list and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

So the final answer is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer, `start` is the second integer from the input if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` is 3, `start` is -1, `num` is a list containing `v`, and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 3, `num` remains an empty list and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

Simplified:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer, `start` is the second integer from the input if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` is 3, `start` is -1, `num` is a list containing `v`, and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 3, `num` remains an empty list and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Final simplified state:

Thus, the final state is:

This simplifies to:
