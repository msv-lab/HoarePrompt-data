The code snippet increments the variable `count_num` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `count_num` is 1, and `i` is between `start` and `end` inclusive.**
