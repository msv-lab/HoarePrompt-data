The code snippet `num = []` reassigns the variable `num` to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an integer that represents the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and `v` is an integer representing the value associated with the constraint.**
