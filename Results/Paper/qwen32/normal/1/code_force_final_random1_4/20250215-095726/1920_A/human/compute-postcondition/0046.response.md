Postcondition: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, and `count_num` is 0 if `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`. Otherwise, `count_num` is 1 and `i` is between `start` and `end` inclusive.**
