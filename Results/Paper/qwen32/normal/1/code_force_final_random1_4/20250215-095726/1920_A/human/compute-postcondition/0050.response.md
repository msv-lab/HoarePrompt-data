Postcondition: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the program does nothing further regarding `count_num`. Otherwise, `count_num` is incremented by 1.**
