The code appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `v`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged unless the conditions for updating `start` or `end` were met before this line, which are not affected by the current line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `i` is incremented by 1; `t` and `v` are integers obtained from the input; `num` now includes `v` appended to it; If `t` equals 1 and `start` was less than `v`, then `start` is updated to the value of `v`; If `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v`, then `end` is updated to the value of `v`.**
