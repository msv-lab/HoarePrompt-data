The code appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Given the initial conditions, `num` is either an empty list or contains the value `v` if `t` was 3. After appending `v`, `num` will definitely contain `v`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `t` remains the first integer from the input.
- `v` remains the second integer from the input.
- `start` remains unchanged based on the given conditions.
- `num` now contains `v` (if it was initially empty) or `v` is appended to it (if it already contained `v`).
- `end` remains unchanged based on the given conditions.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; if `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, then `start` is now equal to `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged; `num` is a list containing `v` or multiple `v` values if `v` was already in `num`; `end` is `v` if `t` is 2 and `end` was greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1.**
