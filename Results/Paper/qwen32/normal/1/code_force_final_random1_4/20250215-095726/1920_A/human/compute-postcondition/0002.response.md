The code snippet provided does not change any of the variables except for `end`. The value of `end` is explicitly set to `1000000000.0`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list that will store integers, `t` is an integer that represents the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and `v` is an integer representing the value associated with the constraint.**
