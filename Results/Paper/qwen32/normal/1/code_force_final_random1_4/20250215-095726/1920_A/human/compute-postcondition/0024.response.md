The given code snippet sets the value of `end` to `v`. This means that regardless of the previous condition that might have set `end` to `v` when `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, the new assignment directly sets `end` to `v`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `t` remains the first integer from the input.
- `v` remains the second integer from the input.
- `start` remains unchanged based on its initial condition.
- `num` remains a list containing `v` if `t` is 3; otherwise, it remains an empty list.
- `end` is now equal to `v`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; if `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, then `start` is now equal to `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged; `num` is a list containing `v` if `t` is 3; otherwise, `num` is an empty list; `end` is `v`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
