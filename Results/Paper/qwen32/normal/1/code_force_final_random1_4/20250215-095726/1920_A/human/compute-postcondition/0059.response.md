Output State: **The program returns the value of `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0.**

This means that the program calculates the difference between `end` and `start` (inclusive) and subtracts the count of numbers in `num` that fall within this range. If the resulting value is non-negative, it returns this value; otherwise, it returns 0.
