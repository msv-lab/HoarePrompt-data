Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and an `n × n` grid of strings composed of '0's and '1's. Each grid contains exactly one triangle or one square made up of '1's with a size greater than 1. The function returns the type of shape ('triangle' or 'square') found in each grid.**
