You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()

                k.append(b.count('1'))

            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an `n × n` grid of strings composed of '0's and '1's. It determines whether the grid contains a square or a triangle made up of '1's and prints "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" accordingly for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to determine whether a given grid contains a square or a triangle based on the counts of '1's in each row. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal to classify the shape as a square. This is insufficient to correctly identify squares and triangles as described in the problem statement.

Here are a few reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Triangle Detection**: The program does not check for the specific pattern required for a triangle. A triangle consists of `k` rows where the `i-th` row has `2*i - 1` consecutive '1's centered in the grid. The program does not verify this pattern.

2. **Square Detection**: While the program checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal, this is not sufficient to confirm that the entire shape is a square. A square requires that all rows have the same number of '1's and that they are aligned at the same distance from the left edge of the grid.

Let's consider a counterexample where the program will fail:

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
4
0010
0110
0110
0010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```

In this example, the program will incorrectly classify the shape as a square because the counts of '1's in the first two rows are both 1, but the shape is actually a triangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
