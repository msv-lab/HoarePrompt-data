Postcondition: **`k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from all previously input strings and the newly input string `b` if '1' is in `b`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged as an empty list if '1' is not in `b`. `i` has been incremented by 1. `a` remains the same. `b` is the newly input string representing a positive integer.**
