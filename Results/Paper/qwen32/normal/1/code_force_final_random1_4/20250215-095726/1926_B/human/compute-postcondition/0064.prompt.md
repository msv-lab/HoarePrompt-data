Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1; `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print('SQUARE')
    else:
        print('TRIANGLE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is a list containing up to `t` elements, each being the count of '1's in `b` if `b` contains at least one '1'. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`. Otherwise, the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is a list. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element, then the first element is equal to the second element. Otherwise, the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: k is a list containing the counts of '1's from all the strings b that contained '1'. i is n + 1 where n is the number of iterations. a is greater than i. If the first element of k is equal to the second element of k, then they are equal. Otherwise, the first element of k is not equal to the second element of k.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
