Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1; `a` must be greater than 0; `k` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that `k` is initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
