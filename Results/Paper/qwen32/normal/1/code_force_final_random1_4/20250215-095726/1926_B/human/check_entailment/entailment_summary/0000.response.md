### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines representing the grid.

2. **Processing the Grid:**
   - For each row in the grid, it checks if there is at least one '1'. If so, it counts the number of '1's in that row and appends this count to the list `k`.

3. **Determining Shape:**
   - The program checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows (`k[0]` and `k[1]`) are equal.
     - If they are equal, it assumes the shape is a square and prints "SQUARE".
     - Otherwise, it assumes the shape is a triangle and prints "TRIANGLE".

### Issues in the Program:

- **Square Detection:** 
  - The program only checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal. This is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square. A square requires that all rows have the same number of '1's and these '1's must be centered in the grid.

- **Triangle Detection:**
  - The program assumes that if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are not equal, the shape must be a triangle. However, this is incorrect because a triangle may have varying numbers of '1's in different rows, but the pattern must follow the specific rules for a triangle (either upright or upside-down).

### Example of Failure:

Consider the following grid:
```
3
001
011
111
```
- The program will read the counts of '1's in the rows as `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Since `k[0] != k[1]`, it will print "TRIANGLE", which is correct in this case.
- However, consider another grid:
```
3
010
111
010
```
- The program will read the counts of '1's in the rows as `[1, 3, 1]`.
- Since `k[0] != k[1]`, it will print "TRIANGLE", which is incorrect because this grid actually represents a square.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to distinguish between a square and a triangle based on the given problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
