Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to determine whether a given grid contains a square or a triangle based on the counts of '1's in each row. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal to classify the shape as a square. This is insufficient to correctly identify squares and triangles as described in the problem statement.

Here are a few reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Triangle Detection**: The program does not check for the specific pattern required for a triangle. A triangle consists of `k` rows where the `i-th` row has `2*i - 1` consecutive '1's centered in the grid. The program does not verify this pattern.

2. **Square Detection**: While the program checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal, this is not sufficient to confirm that the entire shape is a square. A square requires that all rows have the same number of '1's and that they are aligned at the same distance from the left edge of the grid.

Let's consider a counterexample where the program will fail:

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
4
0010
0110
0110
0010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```

In this example, the program will incorrectly classify the shape as a square because the counts of '1's in the first two rows are both 1, but the shape is actually a triangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
