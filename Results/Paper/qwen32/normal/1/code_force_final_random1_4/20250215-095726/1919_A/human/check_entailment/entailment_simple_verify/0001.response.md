### Reasoning:
The original assessment provides a detailed analysis of the problem and the program. Let's break down the key points to verify the correctness of the program:

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game revolves around the total number of coins `a + b`.
   - The parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins determines the winner.
   - If `a + b` is even, Bob wins.
   - If `a + b` is odd, Alice wins.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function checks the parity of the sum `a + b`. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'; otherwise, it returns 'Alice'. This aligns with the game analysis.
   - **func_2()**: This function handles multiple test cases by reading inputs, calling `func_1` for each pair `(a, b)`, and storing the results. Finally, it prints the results.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that `a` and `b` are correctly read from the input and passed to `func_1`.
   - The annotations also show that the results are correctly stored and printed.

4. **Verification**:
   - The annotations and the logic of `func_1` match the problem's requirements.
   - The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Given the above points, the original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The logic implemented in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, and `func_2` correctly handles the input/output operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
