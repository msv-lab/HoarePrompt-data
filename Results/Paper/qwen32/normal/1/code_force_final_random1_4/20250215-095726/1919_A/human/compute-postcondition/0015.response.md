In the given task, the for loop iterates over the `results` list. To ensure that the loop executes, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The other variables mentioned (`a`, `b`, `winner`, and `t`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be directly adjusted to affect the execution of the loop.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

- The `results` list must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- Since `t` is 0, the `results` list currently has no elements (as `t` represents the number of elements in `results`).
- We need to adjust `t` to be at least 1 to ensure that `results` contains at least one element.
- The `results` list should be initialized with at least one element, which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.
- The `winner` variable holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration, but since the loop hasn't executed yet, we don't need to adjust `winner` directly for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing at least one element, which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `t` is 1**.
