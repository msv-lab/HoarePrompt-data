The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least one element, and `result` held the last element of `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two elements, and `result` should be the next element in the list.

Therefore, we need to adjust `result` to be the next element in `results`.

State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing at least two elements, which includes the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `t` is 1; `result` is the next element in `results`**
