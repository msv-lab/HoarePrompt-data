### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing one coin until one of them cannot make a move. The key insight here is to recognize that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (a + b).

- If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice wins.

This is because, with an even total, Alice will always face a situation where Bob can mirror her moves, ensuring Bob wins. Conversely, with an odd total, Alice can force Bob into a losing position.

The provided program correctly implements this logic in `func_1`. It checks whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd and returns "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.

The `func_2` function handles input and output for multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each pair of inputs (a, b) and storing the results. Finally, it prints out the results for all test cases.

Given that the logic in `func_1` aligns with the problem's requirements and `func_2` correctly processes the input and outputs the results, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
