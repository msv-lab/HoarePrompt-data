To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who start with `a` and `b` coins respectively. They take turns swapping wallets and removing one coin until one of them can't make a move. The critical insight is that the game state is determined by the total number of coins (`a + b`). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

### Explanation of the Program:
- **func_1(a, b)**: This function determines the winner based on the sum of coins `a + b`. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'; otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.
- **func_2()**: This function handles the input/output operations. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results.

### Reasoning:
The core logic of the game hinges on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins. Here's why:

1. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If `a + b` is even, Bob wins.
   - If `a + b` is odd, Alice wins.

This is because each move reduces the total number of coins by 1, thus changing the parity. If the initial total is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position (an odd total), and vice versa.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the function `func_1` with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - Total coins: `1 + 1 = 2` (even)
   - Expected winner: Bob
   - `func_1(1, 1)` returns 'Bob' (correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
   - Total coins: `1 + 4 = 5` (odd)
   - Expected winner: Alice
   - `func_1(1, 4)` returns 'Alice' (correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
   - Total coins: `5 + 3 = 8` (even)
   - Expected winner: Bob
   - `func_1(5, 3)` returns 'Bob' (correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Total coins: `4 + 5 = 9` (odd)
   - Expected winner: Alice
   - `func_1(4, 5)` returns 'Alice' (correct)

All these test cases align with the expected outcomes based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, and `func_2` correctly handles the input/output operations.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Final: **True**
