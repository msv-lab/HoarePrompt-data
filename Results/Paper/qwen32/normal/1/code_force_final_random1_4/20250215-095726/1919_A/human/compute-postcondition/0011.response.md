The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the new input, while the other variables (`results`, `winner`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`.**

In natural language: The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the input. The list `results` and the variable `winner` still hold their previous values, which are the return values of `func_1(a, b)` based on the old values of `a` and `b`. The variable `t` is decremented by 1, but it is still greater than 0.
