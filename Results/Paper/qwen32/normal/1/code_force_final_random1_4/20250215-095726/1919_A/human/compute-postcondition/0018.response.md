To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `results` is a list containing at least two elements, with the last element being the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.
- `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration.
- `t` is set to 1.
- `result` is described as "the next element in `results`."

Given this information, the key point here is understanding what `result` refers to. Since `results` is a list and `result` is described as "the next element in `results`," it suggests that `result` is the element immediately following the last element mentioned in the context, which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.

However, since the exact contents of the `results` list are not specified beyond knowing it contains at least two elements and the last element is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, we can only infer that `result` is the second-to-last element in the `results` list.

Thus, the `print(result)` statement will output the second-to-last element of the `results` list.

Output: **result (where result is the second-to-last element in the `results` list)**
