The code appends the value of `winner` to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially empty, after this operation, `results` will contain one element, which is the value of `winner`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `winner` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively; `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**.
