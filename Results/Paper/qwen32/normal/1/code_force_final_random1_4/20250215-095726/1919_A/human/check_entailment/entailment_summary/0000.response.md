### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the functions aligns with the problem description. The problem requires us to determine the winner of the game based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Both players play optimally, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses.

The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins. Here's why:

- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally. This is because Alice will start the game, and no matter what she does (swap or not), Bob can always mirror her moves such that he will be the last one to make a move when the total number of coins becomes zero.
  
- Conversely, if the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally. This is because she can force Bob into a position where he will eventually face a situation where he cannot make a move.

Given this understanding, let's analyze the provided functions:

- **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly implements the logic described above. It checks if the sum of coins `(a + b)` is even or odd and returns 'Bob' if it's even and 'Alice' if it's odd.

- **Function `func_2()`**: This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1(a, b)`, and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Since both functions work as intended and the logic in `func_1` matches the problem's requirements, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
