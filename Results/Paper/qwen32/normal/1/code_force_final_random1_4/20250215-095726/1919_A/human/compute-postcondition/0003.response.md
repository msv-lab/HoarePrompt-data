The code snippet reads two integers from the input, which represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b` respectively. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers within the range 1 to \(10^9\), and `results` is an empty list. After executing the code, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the values read from the input, while `results` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, as read from the input; `results` is an empty list.**
