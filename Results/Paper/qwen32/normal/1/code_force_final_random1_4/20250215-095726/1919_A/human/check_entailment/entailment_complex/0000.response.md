### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify whether the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly predicts the winner of the game when both players play optimally. 

The key insight here is that the game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`). Here's why:

- **Even Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. For instance, if Alice swaps, Bob swaps back; if Alice removes a coin, Bob removes a coin from his wallet. This mirroring strategy ensures that Bob will always be able to make a move after Alice, leading to Bob's victory.
  
- **Odd Total Coins**: Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by ensuring that Bob faces an even number of coins after her first move. She can do this by either swapping or not swapping in such a way that the remaining coins become even. This leaves Bob with the mirroring strategy scenario but starting from an even number of coins, which means Alice will be the last to make a move, leading to her victory.

Given this analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of `a + b` and returning 'Bob' for even totals and 'Alice' for odd totals.

### Correctness:

Since `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy derived from the parity of the total number of coins, and `func_2` properly handles the input/output for multiple test cases, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
