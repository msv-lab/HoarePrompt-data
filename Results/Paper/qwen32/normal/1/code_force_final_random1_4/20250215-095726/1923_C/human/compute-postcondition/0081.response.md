The initial state provides us with several conditions and definitions:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- It is also given that `b - a + 1` is greater than 1.
- Additionally, `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`.

However, the Python code snippet provided is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `c`, or `p`. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
