The code appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given that `p` initially contains only one element `[0]`, after appending `i`, `p` will contain two elements: `[0, i]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` remain the integers read from the input.
- `l` remains the list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element.
- `p` is now `[0, i]`.
- `c` remains the list containing the single element `[0]`.
- `i` remains `x`.
- `j` remains 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is `[0, i]`; `c` is `[0]`; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0.**
