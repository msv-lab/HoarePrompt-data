The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to whatever integers are provided in the input.

Given the initial state, `m` is `m - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, and `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. After executing the code snippet, only `a` and `b` will be updated to the new integers read from the input. The values of `m`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged because they do not depend on the input operation in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**.
