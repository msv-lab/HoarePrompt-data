Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements. If `x` equals 1, `c` is updated to `[0, j, j+1]`. Otherwise, `c` remains `[0, j, j]`. `p` remains `[0, i, i]` and `x` is the next element in `l` after the current `x`.**
