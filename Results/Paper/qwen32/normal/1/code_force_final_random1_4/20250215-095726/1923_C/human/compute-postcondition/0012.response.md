The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `c` was `[0]`, and `j` is either `1` (if `x` is `1`) or `0` (if `x` is not `1`). After appending `j` to `c`, the new value of `c` will be `[0, j]`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is `[0, i]`; `c` is `[0, j]`; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0.**
