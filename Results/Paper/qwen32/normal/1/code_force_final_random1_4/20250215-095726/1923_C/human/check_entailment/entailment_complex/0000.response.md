### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Sum Condition**: The sum of the subarray should be equal to the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
2. **Non-equality Condition**: No element in the subarray should be equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. **Positive Elements Condition**: All elements in `b` must be positive.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `q` (number of queries).
   - It then reads the array `l` of length `n`.

2. **Prefix Sum and Count Arrays**:
   - `p` is a prefix sum array where `p[i]` holds the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`.
   - `c` is a prefix count array where `c[i]` holds the count of `1`s in the first `i` elements of `l`.

3. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, it calculates the sum (`s`) and count of `1`s (`i`) in the subarray from index `a` to `b` using the prefix arrays.
   - It then checks if the subarray is "good" based on the conditions:
     - The subarray length must be greater than 1.
     - The difference between the sum of the subarray and the length of the subarray must be at least the count of `1`s in the subarray. This is because if we want to construct `b` such that all `b[i] > 0` and `b[i] != a[i]`, we need to ensure that the remaining sum after subtracting the length of the subarray (which would be the minimum sum if all `b[i]` were `1`) is at least the count of `1`s in the subarray (since those positions already have `1` in `a` and thus need to be increased).

#### Evaluation:
- The code correctly uses prefix sums and counts to efficiently handle the queries.
- The logic for checking if a subarray is "good" seems correct based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
