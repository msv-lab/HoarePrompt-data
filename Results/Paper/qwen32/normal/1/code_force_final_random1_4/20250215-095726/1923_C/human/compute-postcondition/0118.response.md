The given code appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. The values of `x`, `i`, and `p` are not affected by this operation. The only change is in the list `c`, which now includes the value of `j` at the end.

Output State: **`x` is `x_next`; `i` is increased by `x_next`; if `x` is equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `p` has `i` appended to it; `c` has `j` appended to it.**
