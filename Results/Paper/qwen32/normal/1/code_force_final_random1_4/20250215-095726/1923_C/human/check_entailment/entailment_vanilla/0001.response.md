Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine whether a subarray of the given array `c` is "good" according to the following criteria:
1. There exists an array `b` of the same length as the subarray such that the sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. No element in `b` should be equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.
3. All elements in `b` must be positive.

### Key Observations

- Since all elements in `c` are positive, we can always construct an array `b` where each element `b[i]` is either `a[i] + 1` or `a[i] - 1`, ensuring that `b[i]` is positive and different from `a[i]`.
- To satisfy the condition that the sum of `b` equals the sum of `a`, we need to ensure that the total increment or decrement across the subarray is zero.
- If the subarray has more than one element, it is always possible to adjust the values of `b` such that the sum remains the same and no element is equal to the corresponding element in `a`.

### Detailed Reasoning

1. **Single Element Subarrays**: 
   - For a single-element subarray, it is impossible to create a `b` array that satisfies the conditions because there is no way to change the value while keeping the sum the same and ensuring positivity.
   
2. **Multiple Element Subarrays**:
   - For subarrays with more than one element, we can adjust the values of `b` such that the sum remains unchanged. For example, if we have a subarray `[x, y]`, we can set `b = [x+1, y-1]` if `y > 1`. This ensures that the sum is the same (`x + y = (x+1) + (y-1)`), and no element is equal to the corresponding element in `a`.
   - If the subarray contains multiple elements, we can always find a way to distribute the increments and decrements so that the sum remains the same and all elements in `b` are positive.

### Program Analysis

The provided program uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. It also counts the number of ones in the subarray using another prefix sum array. The logic in the program checks if the subarray can be adjusted to meet the criteria by ensuring that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the count of ones in the subarray.

However, the program's logic for determining if a subarray is "good" is flawed. Specifically, the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` does not correctly account for the ability to adjust the values of `b` to meet the criteria for all subarrays with more than one element.

### Conclusion

The program fails to correctly determine if a subarray is "good" for all cases, particularly when the subarray contains only ones or when the adjustments required to make `b` different from `a` while maintaining the sum are not properly handled.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
