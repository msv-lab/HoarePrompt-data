The value of `i` is incremented by the value of `x`. Since `x` is `x_next_next`, the new value of `i` will be `i + x_next_next`. The condition regarding `j` does not affect the execution of the given code snippet, so `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `x_next_next`; `i` is `i + x_next_next`; `j` is unchanged.**
