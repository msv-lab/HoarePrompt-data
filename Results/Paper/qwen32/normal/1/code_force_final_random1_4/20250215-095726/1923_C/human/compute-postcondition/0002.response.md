The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, `t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), inclusive. The values of `n` and `m` are integers read from the input but are not altered by this code. The new variable `l` is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
