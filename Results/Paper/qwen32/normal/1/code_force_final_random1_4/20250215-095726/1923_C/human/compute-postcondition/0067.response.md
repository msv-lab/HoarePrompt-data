The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given the initial state, `p` was initially `[0, i]`. After appending `i`, `p` becomes `[0, i, i]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains \(t-1\)
- `n` remains the first input integer
- `m` remains the second input integer
- `l` remains a list of integers with at least one element
- `p` is now `[0, i, i]`
- `i` remains `next_x + x`
- `j` remains `2` if `next_x` is `1` else `j` remains `1`
- `c` remains `[0, j]`

Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\), `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `p` is `[0, i, i]`, `i` is `next_x + x`, `j` is `2` if `next_x` is `1` else `j` is `1`, and `c` is `[0, j]`.**
