The code snippet `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `i` is described as "the next element in `l` after `x`," which means `i` holds a specific value from the list `l`. After executing `i += x`, `i` will be updated to its original value plus `x`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `x`, and `j`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `x` is an integer, `j` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1, `i` is the next element in `l` after `x` plus `x`.**
