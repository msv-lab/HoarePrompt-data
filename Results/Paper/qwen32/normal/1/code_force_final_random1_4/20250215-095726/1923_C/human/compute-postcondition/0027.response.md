The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`). Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variables `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s in `l`, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.**
