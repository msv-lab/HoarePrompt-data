The code snippet increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is initially set to `2` if `next_x` is `1`, otherwise `j` is `1`. After executing `j += 1`, the new value of `j` will be `3` if it was initially `2`, or `2` if it was initially `1`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\), `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `p` is `[0, i, i]`, `i` is `next_x + x`, `j` is `3` if `next_x` is `1` else `j` is `2`, `c` is `[0, j, j]`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`**.
