The code appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. This means that the list `c` will now have one more element at the end, which is `j`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `x`, `i`, `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements; If `x` equals 1, `c` is updated to `[0, j, j+1]`. Otherwise, `c` remains `[0, j, j]`; `p` is `[0, i, i, i]`; `x` is the next element in `l` after the current `x`; `i` is increased by `x`; `c` is now `[0, j, j+1, j]` if `x` was 1 initially, otherwise `c` is now `[0, j, j, j]`.**
