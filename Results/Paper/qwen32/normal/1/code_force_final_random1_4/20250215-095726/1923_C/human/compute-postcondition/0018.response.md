The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `c` is initially `[0, j]`. After appending `j`, `c` becomes `[0, j, j]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i, i]`, `c` is `[0, j, j]`, `x` is an integer, `j` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1, `i` is the next element in `l` after `x` plus `x`.**
