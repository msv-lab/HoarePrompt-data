### Reasoning

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided program based on the given function summary and problem description.

#### Problem Recap

We need to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` is "good" based on the following conditions:
1. There exists an array `b` of the same length as the subarray such that the sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. No element in `b` should be equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.
3. All elements in `b` must be positive.

#### Key Observations

- **Single Element Subarrays**: 
  - For a single-element subarray, it is impossible to create a `b` array that satisfies the conditions because there is no way to change the value while keeping the sum the same and ensuring positivity.
  
- **Multiple Element Subarrays**:
  - For subarrays with more than one element, it is generally possible to adjust the values of `b` such that the sum remains unchanged. For example, if we have a subarray `[x, y]`, we can set `b = [x+1, y-1]` if `y > 1`. This ensures that the sum is the same (`x + y = (x+1) + (y-1)`), and no element is equal to the corresponding element in `a`.
  - If the subarray contains multiple elements, we can always find a way to distribute the increments and decrements so that the sum remains the same and all elements in `b` are positive.

#### Program Analysis

The program uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. It also counts the number of ones in the subarray using another prefix sum array. The logic in the program checks if the subarray can be adjusted to meet the criteria by ensuring that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the count of ones in the subarray.

The key part of the program logic is:
```python
if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

Here:
- `s` is the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i]`.
- `b - a + 1` is the length of the subarray.
- `i` is the count of ones in the subarray `c[l_i:r_i]`.

The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element. The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is intended to check if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the count of ones in the subarray. This condition is derived from the observation that if we have more ones, we need to ensure that the remaining elements can be adjusted without making them non-positive.

#### Correctness of the Program

Let's verify if the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is sufficient to determine if a subarray is "good":

- **Single Element Subarrays**: 
  - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element, so single-element subarrays will automatically be marked as "NO".

- **Multiple Element Subarrays**:
  - For subarrays with more than one element, the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the count of ones in the subarray. This means that we can adjust the remaining elements to ensure that the sum remains the same and all elements in `b` are positive.

Given these observations, the program's logic appears to be correct. The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is sufficient to determine if a subarray is "good" for all valid cases.

### Conclusion

The program correctly determines if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **True**
