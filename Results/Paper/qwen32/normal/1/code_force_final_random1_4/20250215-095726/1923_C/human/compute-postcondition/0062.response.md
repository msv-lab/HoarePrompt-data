The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `c` is initially `[0]`. After appending `j`, the new value of `c` will be `[0, j]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains \(t-1\).
- `n` remains the first input integer.
- `m` remains the second input integer.
- `l` remains a list of integers with at least one element.
- `p` remains `[0, i]`.
- `i` remains `x`.
- `j` remains `1` if `x` is `1`; otherwise, `j` remains `0`.
- `c` is now `[0, j]`.

Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\), `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `i` is `x`, `j` is `1` if `x` is `1`; otherwise, `j` is `0`, and `c` is `[0, j]`.**
