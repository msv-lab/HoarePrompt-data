The given code snippet reassigns the variable `s` with the same expression it was initially assigned, which means the value of `s` remains unchanged. The other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`m` is `m - 2`, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**
