The value of `i` is incremented by `x`. Given the initial state, `i` was 0, so `i` becomes `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing the single element 0; `c` is a list containing the single element 0; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 0.**
