You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from the last test case; `l` is the list of `n` integers from the last test case; `p` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative sums of elements in `l` from the last test case; `c` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l` from the last test case; `i` is the sum of all elements in `l` from the last test case; `j` is the count of `1`s in `l` from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether a specific condition involving the sum and count of elements in a sublist is met, printing 'YES' if the condition is satisfied and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` is "good".
- A subarray is "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that:
  1. The sum of elements in the subarray equals the sum of elements in `b`.
  2. No element in the subarray is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
  3. All elements in `b` are greater than 0.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program uses prefix sums and counts of 1s to determine if a subarray is "good". Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation (`p`)**: This array stores cumulative sums of the elements in the array `c`.
2. **Count of 1s Calculation (`c`)**: This array stores cumulative counts of 1s in the array `c`.
3. **Query Processing**: For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums and the count of 1s in the subarray. It then checks if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` meeting the criteria.

### Potential Issues:
- **Condition 1**: The sum of the subarray must equal the sum of `b`. This is handled by checking the sum of the subarray.
- **Condition 2**: No element in the subarray should be equal to the corresponding element in `b`. This is checked by ensuring that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray.
- **Condition 3**: All elements in `b` must be greater than 0. Since we are only dealing with positive integers in `c`, this condition is implicitly satisfied if we ensure that `b` has a valid transformation.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the provided example:
```
Input:
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3

Output:
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

- **Query 1 (1 5)**: Subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` has a sum of 13 and 2 ones. We can create `b` as `[2, 3, 2, 5, 6]` which satisfies all conditions.
- **Query 2 (4 4)**: Subarray `[4]` has a sum of 4 and no ones. We cannot create `b` as `[5]` because `b` would not be different from `c`.
- **Query 3 (3 4)**: Subarray `[1, 4]` has a sum of 5 and 1 one. We can create `b` as `[2, 5]` which satisfies all conditions.
- **Query 4 (1 3)**: Subarray `[1, 2, 1]` has a sum of 4 and 2 ones. We can create `b` as `[2, 3, 2]` which satisfies all conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the provided example correctly. However, let's consider an edge case to ensure robustness:
- **Edge Case**: Consider a subarray with all elements being 1s. For example, `[1, 1, 1]`. The sum is 3 and the count of 1s is 3. We cannot create `b` as `[2, 2, 2]` because the sum condition would not be met (`3 - 3 < 3`). The program should correctly identify this as "NO".

After thorough analysis, the program appears to correctly handle the problem description for the provided example and the edge case.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks the conditions for a subarray to be "good" by using prefix sums and counts of 1s. It handles the provided example and an edge case correctly, ensuring that all conditions are met.
