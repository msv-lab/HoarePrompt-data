The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, `p`, `c`, or `m`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`, `p` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer.**
