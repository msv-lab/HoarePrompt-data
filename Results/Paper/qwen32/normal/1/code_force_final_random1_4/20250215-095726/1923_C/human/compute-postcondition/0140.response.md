Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
     - `c` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`.
     - `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`.
   - `p` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative sums of elements in `l`.
   - `m` is `m - 1` (though `m` is not used in the print statement).
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

### Analysis

The print statement does not depend on any of the variables `i`, `j`, `p`, `c`, `m`, `a`, `b`, or `s`. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion

Since the print statement is independent of the values of the variables and lists described in the initial state, it will always print `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
