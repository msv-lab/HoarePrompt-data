The code `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `i` was initially `0`. After the operation, `i` will be equal to `x`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\), `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `p` is `[0]`, `i` is `x`, `j` is `1` if `x` is `1`; otherwise, `j` is `0`, and `c` is `[0]`.**

In natural language, the value of `i` has been updated to the value of `x`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
