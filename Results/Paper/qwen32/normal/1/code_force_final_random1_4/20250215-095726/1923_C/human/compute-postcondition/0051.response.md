The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means the previous values of `n` and `m` are overwritten. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `p`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\), `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`**.
