Output State: **`x` is `x_next`; `i` is increased by `x_next`; if `x` is equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by the value of `x_next`. The value of `x` remains `x_next`. The condition regarding `j` (whether it increases by 1 if `x` equals 1) is preserved and not affected by the increment operation on `i`.
