### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the program to understand if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Array `a` is good if:**
   - There exists an array `b` such that the sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
   - Every element in `a` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
   - Every element in `b` is greater than 0.

2. **Given an array `c`, for each query, check if the subarray `c[l:r+1]` is good.**

#### Key Observations:
- For a subarray to be "good", the sum of the subarray must be able to be split into another set of positive integers where no integer matches the original subarray.
- If the subarray has more than one element and the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the number of ones in the subarray, then it can be rearranged to satisfy the conditions (since we can replace ones with other positive integers and adjust the rest).

#### Program Analysis:
- The program initializes prefix sums (`p`) and counts of ones (`c`) for the array.
- For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums and the count of ones within the subarray.
- It then checks if the subarray can be rearranged to meet the conditions:
  - `b - a + 1 > 1`: Ensures the subarray has more than one element.
  - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`: Ensures that after subtracting the number of elements in the subarray from the sum, there is enough "extra" to replace the ones with other positive integers.

#### Conclusion:
The logic in the program seems to correctly implement the conditions necessary for a subarray to be considered "good". It efficiently computes the required values using prefix sums and counts of ones, and then checks the conditions for each query.

### Correctness: **True**
