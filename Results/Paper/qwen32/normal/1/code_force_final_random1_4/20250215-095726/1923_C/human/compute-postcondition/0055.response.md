The code snippet assigns `0` to both `i` and `j`. This means the previous values of `i` and `j` are overwritten. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\), `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `p` is `[0]`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, `c` is `[0]`**.
