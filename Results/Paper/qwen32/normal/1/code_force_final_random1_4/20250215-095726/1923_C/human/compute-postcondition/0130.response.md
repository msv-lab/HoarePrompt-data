The code snippet assigns the value `p[b] - p[a - 1]` to the variable `s`. This means `s` now holds the difference between the cumulative sum up to index `b` and the cumulative sum up to index `a-1` from the list `p`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `s`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`; `p` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative sums of elements in `l`; `c` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`; `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the first input integer; `b` is the second input integer; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**
