Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `m` which are integers representing the dimensions of the field (both being odd and within the range of 3 to 99). It also accepts `grid`, a 2D list of strings representing the field's cells, `elements`, a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, `allPlayers`, a dictionary mapping player identifiers to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle, `goal`, a list of lists containing tuples representing the positions of the goals for each team, and `points`, a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively. The function does not explicitly return any value, implying it may modify the input parameters or perform actions based on the provided data.**
