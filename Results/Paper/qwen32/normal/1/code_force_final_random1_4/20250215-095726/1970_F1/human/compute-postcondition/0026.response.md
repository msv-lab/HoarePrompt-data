Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element, which is the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including `line[1]: (0, 1)`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, otherwise `allPlayers` remains empty; `goal` is a list of two lists, where one of them contains the tuple `(0, 1)` if the second character of the current element at index `ind` in `line` is 'G' and `(0, 1)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `i` is 0; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input and must have at least one element; `ind` is 1; `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', then `(0, 1)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`.**
