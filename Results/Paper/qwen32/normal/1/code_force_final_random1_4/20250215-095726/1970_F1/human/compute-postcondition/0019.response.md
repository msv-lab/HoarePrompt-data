Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element, which is the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid with `elements = {'.B': (-1, -1), line[ind]: (i, ind)}`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, otherwise `allPlayers` remains empty; `goal` is a list of two lists, where one of them contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of the current element at index `ind` in `line` is 'G'; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `i` is 0; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input and must have at least one element; the current element at index `ind` in `line` is not equal to '..'. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to False. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', one of the lists in `goal` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.**
