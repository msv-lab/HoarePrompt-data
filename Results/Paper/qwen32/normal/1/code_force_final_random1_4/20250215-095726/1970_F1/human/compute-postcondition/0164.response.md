Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input, with the position of `obj` updated to `nxt` if `obj` is a player and `com` is not 'T'; `time` is incremented by 1; `command` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `pos` is the position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary; `nxt` is the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True, or if `isPlayer(obj)` is True and `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, no changes are made to `elements`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False` and if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1.**
