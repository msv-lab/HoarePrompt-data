To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just `ind`.

Given the loop:
```python
for ind in range(len(line)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `ind` was 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ind` is less than `len(line)`. Therefore, to proceed to the next iteration, `ind` should be incremented by 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over `ind` in the range of `len(line)`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `ind` was 1.
3. For the loop to execute again, `ind` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `i`, `line`, `tmp`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element, which is the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including `line[1]: (0, 1)` if `line[1]` is not equal to '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[1]] = False` if `isPlayer(line[1])` is True and `line[1]` is not equal to '..', otherwise `allPlayers` remains empty; `goal` is a list of two lists, where one of them contains the tuple `(0, 1)` if the second character of `line[1]` is 'G' and `line[1]` is not equal to '..'; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `i` is 0; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input and must have at least one element; `ind` is 2; `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B' and `line[1]` is not equal to '..', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
