The code reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter. This list is assigned to the variable `command`. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, and `time` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input; `time` is incremented by 1; `command` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input.**
