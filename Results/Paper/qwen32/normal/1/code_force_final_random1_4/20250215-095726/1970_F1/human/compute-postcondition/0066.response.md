Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in `line`, with `elements[line[1]]` updated to `(i, 1)` if `line[1]` is not '..', and `elements[line[2]]` updated to `(i, 2)`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[1]] = False` if `line[1]` is a player entity; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and if `line[1]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 1)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[1]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `line` is a list of strings with at least one element; `ind` is 2. If `line[2][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` includes the additional tuple `(i, 2)`.**
