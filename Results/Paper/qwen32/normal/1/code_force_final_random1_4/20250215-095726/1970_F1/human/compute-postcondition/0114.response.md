Let's break down the given print statement and the initial state to determine what will be printed:

The print statement is:
```python
print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

From the initial state, we have the following relevant information:
- `time` is an integer representing some time value (though its exact value isn't specified).
- `GoalName` is a dictionary that maps team indices to goal names. Since the specific contents of `GoalName` are not provided, we'll assume it follows a common pattern where `GoalName[0]` might be something like "Red" and `GoalName[1]` might be "Blue".
- `team` is determined by the first character of `obj`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1 (Blue team). Otherwise, `team` is 0 (Red team).

Given this, the print statement will output the current `time` followed by the goal name for the team specified by `team`, and then the string "CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH".

Since the exact value of `time` and the contents of `GoalName` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **time GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where time is the current time value and GoalName[team] is the goal name for the team specified by team)**
