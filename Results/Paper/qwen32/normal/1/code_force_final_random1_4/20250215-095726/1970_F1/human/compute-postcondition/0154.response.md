Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input; `time` is incremented by 1; `command` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `pos` is the position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary; `nxt` is the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`; `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `player` is set to `obj` if `obj` is a player (as determined by the `isPlayer` function). Otherwise, `player` is set to the entity found at the new position `nxt` in the `grid`. All other variables retain their previous values.
