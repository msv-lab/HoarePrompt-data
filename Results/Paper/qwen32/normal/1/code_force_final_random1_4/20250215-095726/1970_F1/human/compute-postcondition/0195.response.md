To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the relevant parts of the initial state:

- `points` is a list of two integers representing the final scores of the blue and red teams respectively.

The print statement is:
```python
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
```

This statement formats and prints the final scores of the blue and red teams. Specifically:
- `points[0]` represents the final score of the blue team.
- `points[1]` represents the final score of the red team.

Given that `points` is explicitly described as a list of two integers, we can infer that `points[0]` and `points[1]` will be these two integers.

Therefore, the output will be a string formatted as "FINAL SCORE: [blue_team_score] [red_team_score]", where `[blue_team_score]` and `[red_team_score]` are the actual integer values stored in `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

Since the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not provided in the initial state, we describe them in terms of the list `points`.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] is the final score of the blue team and points[1] is the final score of the red team)**
