Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` for all player entities in the input except `allPlayers[obj]` which is now `True` if `pos` is a goal position; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [points[0], points[1] + 1]` if `team` is 1, or `points = [points[0] + 1, points[1]]` if `team` is 0 when `pos` is a goal position; `t` must be greater than 0; `command` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the standard input; `obj` is the first element of `command` and `obj` is equal to '.B'; `com` is the second element of `command`; `pos` is the position of `obj` in the grid as retrieved from `elements[obj]`; `nxt` is the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, then no changes are made to `allPlayers`, `points`, and `elements[obj]`.**
