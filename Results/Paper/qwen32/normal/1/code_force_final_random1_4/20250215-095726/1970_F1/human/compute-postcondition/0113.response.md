The code snippet increments the score of the team specified by the `team` variable by 10. Given that `team` is determined by whether `obj[0]` is 'B' (Blue) or not (Red), the score for either the Blue or Red team will increase by 10.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` for all player entities in the input; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points[0]` being the score of the Red team and `points[1]` being the score of the Blue team, and one of these scores has been increased by 10; `t` must be greater than 0; `command` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the standard input; the length of `command` is 3; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `el` is the third element of `command`. Additionally, `el` is not equal to '.Q' and `el` is equal to '.S'; `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the score for either the Blue or Red team has increased by 10, depending on the value of `team`. All other variables remain unchanged.
