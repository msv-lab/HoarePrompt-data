The given code snippet reads a new line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings based on whitespace. This new list of strings replaces the existing `line` list.

Since the initial state specifies that `line` is already a list of strings obtained from a previous input, reading another line will replace this list with the contents of the newly read line.

No other variables are modified by this code snippet, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element, which is the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in `line`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` for all player entities in `line`; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `i` is 1; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a newly read line from the input.**
