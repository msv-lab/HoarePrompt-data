Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` for all player entities in the input; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `t` is an integer read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input. If the length of `command` is 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` equals '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is equal to '.S', one of the scores in `points` has been increased by 10, and `team` is determined based on whether `obj[0]` is 'B' (Blue team) or not (Red team). If the length of `command` is not 3, `obj` is the first element of `command` and `obj` is equal to '.B'; `com` is the second element of `command`; `pos` is the position of `obj` in the grid as retrieved from `elements[obj]`; `nxt` is the new position calculated based on `com`. If `obj` is not a player or if `obj` is a player and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is not a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` unless `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`. If `pos` is a goal position, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True` and the corresponding team's score in `points` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input; `time` is incremented by 1; `command` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`. If `len(command) == 3`, `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is equal to '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is equal to '.S', `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, the position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary is updated to `nxt` if `obj` is `.B` and certain conditions are met, otherwise, the position remains unchanged. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False` and if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid; `time` is incremented by 1; `command` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`. If `len(command)` is 3, there is an unpacking error and `el` is undefined. If `el` equals '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el` equals '.S', then `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `len(command)` is not 3, `pos` is the position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary; `nxt` is the new position `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True, or if `isPlayer(obj)` is True and `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, no changes are made to `elements`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
