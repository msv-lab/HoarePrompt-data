To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
- `a[i]` was updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

From the loop statement `for i in range(1, n):`, we know that `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Since the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`, `n` does not change between iterations. It remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `i_end + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_end`, we can express the state in terms of the increment:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 (from its value at the end of the previous iteration)**

However, if we assume `i_end` to be the value right before the increment (which was the value of `i` at the start of the previous iteration), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `i_end + 1`.

So, if `i_end` was 2 (as an example), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 3.

For a general case without specific values:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1**

If we need a concrete example, let's assume `i_end` was 2:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3**

But sticking to the general form as per the instructions:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1**
