In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which is read from the input. The loop head only involves the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment to ensure the loop can execute is the value of `t`.

Given that `t` is already described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is already ensured that the loop will execute at least once if `t` is within this range. There's no need to adjust `t` further since it directly controls the number of iterations.

However, to adhere strictly to the requirement of adjusting the state based on the loop head, we can confirm that the input should provide a valid integer `t` within the specified range.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should confirm that `t` is a valid integer within the given constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
