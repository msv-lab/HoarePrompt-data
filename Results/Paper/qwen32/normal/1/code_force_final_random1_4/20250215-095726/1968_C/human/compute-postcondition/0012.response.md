To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`:** 
   - It is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - This variable seems to represent the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not directly influence the current print statement.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - It is an input integer.
   - This variable indicates the length of the list `x`.

3. **List `x`:**
   - It is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - The length of this list is `n`.

4. **List `a`:**
   - `a[0]` is explicitly set to 1000.
   - For `i > 0`, `a[i]` is calculated as `1000 + sum(x[0] to x[i-1])`.

### Calculation of List `a`:

- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + sum(x[0])`
- `a[2] = 1000 + sum(x[0] to x[1])`
- `a[3] = 1000 + sum(x[0] to x[2])`
- ...
- `a[n] = 1000 + sum(x[0] to x[n-1])`

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement `print(*a)` will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Detailed Output Description:

Given the above calculations, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting with 1000, followed by 1000 plus the cumulative sums of the elements in the list `x`.

### Final Output:

Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-1]**
