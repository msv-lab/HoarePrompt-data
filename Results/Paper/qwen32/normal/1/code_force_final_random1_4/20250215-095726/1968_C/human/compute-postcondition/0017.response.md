The code sets the first element of the list `a` to 1000. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `a[0]` which is 1000.**
