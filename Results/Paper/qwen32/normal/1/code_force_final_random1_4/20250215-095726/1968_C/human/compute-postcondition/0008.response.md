The given code modifies the value of `a[i]` by setting it to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 4, the new value of `a[4]` will be `a[3] + x[3]`.

Since the initial state specifies that `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `1000 + sum(x[0] to x[i-1])`, `a[3]` would be `1000 + sum(x[0] to x[2])`. Therefore, the new value of `a[4]` will be `1000 + sum(x[0] to x[2]) + x[3]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `a[0]` to `a[3]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000, `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, `a[3]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`, and `a[4]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2] + x[3]`; `i` is 4.**
