Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem according to the given requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to construct an array `a` such that:
- Each element `a_i` is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.
- For each `i` from 2 to `n`, `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program initializes `a[0]` to 1000 and then iteratively sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. Let's check if this approach guarantees that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

1. **Initialization**: The first element `a[0]` is set to 1000. This is within the required range `[1, 10^9]`.
2. **Iteration**: For each subsequent element `a[i]`, the program sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This ensures that `a[i] > a[i-1]` since `x[i-1] >= 1`. However, we need to verify if `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]`.

   - By construction, `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. Therefore, `a[i] % a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) % a[i-1] = x[i-1] % a[i-1]`.
   - Since `x[i-1] < a[i-1]` (because `x[i-1]` is a remainder when dividing by `a[i-1]`), `x[i-1] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]`. Thus, `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` holds true.

3. **Range Check**: The constructed values of `a[i]` will be at most `1000 + 500*(n-1)` (since `x[i-1] <= 500` and `n <= 500`). Given that `500*499 = 249500`, which is well within the range `[1, 10^9]`, all `a[i]` will satisfy the upper bound condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly constructs the array `a` such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `i` from 2 to `n` and all elements of `a` are within the specified range.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
