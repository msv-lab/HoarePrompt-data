Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable seems to represent the number of test cases, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is an input integer. This represents the length of the list `x`.
- `x` is a list of integers with length `n`. The specific values of `x` are not provided, so we will refer to them as `x[0], x[1], ..., x[n-1]`.
- `a` is a list where:
  - `a[0]` is set to 1000.
  - For `i > 0`, `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`.

### Calculation of `a`:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + x[0]`
- `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (1000 + x[0]) + x[1] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
- Continuing this pattern, `a[i] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1]`

### Print Statement:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Output Description:
Given the above calculations, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1000, where each subsequent number is the previous number plus the corresponding element from the list `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-1]**
