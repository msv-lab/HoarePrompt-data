The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `x` are affected, but the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**.
