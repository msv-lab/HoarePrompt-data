The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is decreased by 1, but since there's no operation affecting `t` in the given code snippet, its state remains unchanged. Therefore, `n` will hold the integer value obtained from the user input.

Output State: **`t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an input integer**.
