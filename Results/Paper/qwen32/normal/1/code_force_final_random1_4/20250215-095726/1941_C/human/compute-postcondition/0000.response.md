In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the function `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on these elements.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `_`**: This is a throwaway variable used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is intentionally unused. We don't need to adjust its state explicitly since it doesn't influence the loop's execution.

2. **Function `int(input())`**: This part of the loop head reads an integer from the input, which determines how many times the loop will iterate. For the loop to execute at least once, this integer (`t`) must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given the initial state provided: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself because it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

However, to align with the format requested, we should specify that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
