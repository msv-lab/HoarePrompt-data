### Reasoning:

The task is to determine whether a given string `s` contains the substrings "pie" or "map". If it does, we need to find the minimum number of characters to remove to eliminate these substrings. The provided program calculates the total number of occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string and outputs their sum. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions.

For example, consider the string "mapie". The program would count one occurrence of "map" and one occurrence of "pie", resulting in a total of 2 deletions. However, removing just the 'm' and 'p' from "mapie" would make the string "aie", which is beautiful, requiring only 2 deletions, but the optimal solution might involve fewer deletions if overlaps or different removal strategies are considered.

The correct approach should involve dynamic programming or a more sophisticated algorithm to ensure that the minimum number of deletions is calculated, taking into account potential overlaps and optimal removal sequences.

Given the current implementation, it simply sums up the counts of non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie", which does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required.
