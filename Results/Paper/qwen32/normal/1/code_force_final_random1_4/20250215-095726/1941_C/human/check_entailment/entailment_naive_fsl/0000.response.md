Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum. However, this approach does not necessarily give the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the resulting string.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
mpaie
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:** We can remove either 'm' or 'e' to make the string beautiful. Removing 'm' results in "paie", and removing 'e' results in "mpai", neither of which contain "map" or "pie".

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
```
1
```

While the provided program gives the correct output for this specific case, it is not guaranteed to do so for all cases. For instance:

**Input:**
```
1
6
mpamap
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:** We need to remove two 'm's or two 'a's to make the string beautiful. Removing the first and last 'm' results in "pama", which does not contain "map" or "pie".

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
```
2
```

Although the provided program works for these specific examples, it does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To solve this problem correctly, we would need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, to ensure that we are making the minimum number of deletions to eliminate all occurrences of "map" and "pie".
