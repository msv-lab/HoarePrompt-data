To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is the new integer input by the user.
- `s` is the new string input by the user.
- `x` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x + y)
```

### Explanation:
The code snippet will print the sum of `x` and `y`. Here, `x` represents the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`, and `y` represents the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`.

Since the specific string `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`. However, we know that `x` and `y` are counts of specific substrings within `s`.

### Output:
The output will be the sum of the counts of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the count of occurrences of 'map' in s, and y is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in s)**
