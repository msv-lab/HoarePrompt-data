Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; the loop has executed exactly `t` times; for each of the `t` iterations, an integer `a` was input, followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters; for each string `s`, `x` is the count of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, and `y` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`; the program has printed the sum of `x` and `y` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have executed exactly `t` times (where `t` is the initial integer input). For each iteration, it will have read an integer `a` and a string `s`. It then counts how many times 'map' and 'pie' appear in `s` and prints the sum of these counts. This process repeats `t` times, with the final output being the sum of 'map' and 'pie' counts for each of the `t` strings provided.
