To determine the output of the `print(x + y)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variable `t`:** This is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. However, `t` does not directly influence the output of the `print(x + y)` statement, so it can be disregarded for this specific print operation.

2. **Variable `a`:** This is an integer input by the user. Similar to `t`, `a` does not affect the calculation of `x + y`.

3. **Variable `s`:** This is a new string input by the user. The value of `s` is crucial because `x` and `y` are derived from this string.

4. **Variable `x`:** This is the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.

5. **Variable `y`:** This is the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.

The `print(x + y)` statement will output the sum of the counts of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

- The user inputs a string `s`.
- The program calculates how many times the substring 'map' appears in `s` and assigns this count to `x`.
- The program calculates how many times the substring 'pie' appears in `s` and assigns this count to `y`.
- The program then prints the sum of `x` and `y`.

### Example Calculation:

Suppose the user inputs the string `s = "maple pie map map pie"`. Then:
- `x` would be the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, which is 3.
- `y` would be the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, which is 2.
- Therefore, `x + y` would be `3 + 2 = 5`.

However, since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `x + y`. We can only describe it in terms of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

### Final Output Description:

The `print(x + y)` statement will output the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the count of occurrences of 'map' in the string s and y is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the string s)**
