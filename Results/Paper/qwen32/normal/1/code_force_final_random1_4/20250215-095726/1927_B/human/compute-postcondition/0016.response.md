The given code snippet updates the `array` variable by reading a new list of integers from the user input. This means the previous `array` and its derived `rev_array` (which is the reverse of `array`) will be replaced with the new input values. However, the other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `alp`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` remains 1.
- `l` remains the integer input by the user.
- `array` is now the list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `alp` remains a list of lowercase English alphabet letters.
- `rev_array` is now the reversed list of the new `array`.
- `ans` remains a list of `l` characters where each character is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for j in range(l), but since `rev_array` has changed, `ans` will also need to be recalculated based on the new `rev_array`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is the integer input by the user, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet letters, `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`, `ans` is a list of `l` characters where each character is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for j in range(l) based on the new `rev_array`.**
