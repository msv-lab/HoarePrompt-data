The given code snippet reverses the `array` and assigns it to `rev_array`. This means that the order of elements in `rev_array` will be the reverse of the order in `array`.

Given the Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 2
- `l` is the new integer input by the user
- `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input
- `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
- `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`
- `ans` is a list of length `l` containing characters from `alp` based on the count of elements in the remaining part of `rev_array`

After executing the line `rev_array = array[::-1]`, the `rev_array` will be the reversed version of `array`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `l` is the new integer input by the user; `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input; `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reversed list of `array`; `ans` is a list of length `l` containing characters from `alp` based on the count of elements in the remaining part of `rev_array`.**
