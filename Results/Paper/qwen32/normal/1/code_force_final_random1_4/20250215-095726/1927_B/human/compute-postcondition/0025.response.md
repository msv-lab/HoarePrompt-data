To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet within the context of the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `alp` is the list of lowercase English letters.
- `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`.
- `ans` is a list containing two elements where the second element is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`.
- `j` is 3.

The code snippet is:
```python
ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
```

This line appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]`, subtracting 1 from this count, and using the result as an index into the list `alp`.

Let's denote:
- `rev_array[j]` as `x`.
- The count of `x` in `rev_array[j:]` as `count_x`.

Then, the new element appended to `ans` is `alp[count_x - 1]`.

Given that `ans` initially contains two elements, after appending the new element, `ans` will contain three elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`, `ans` is a list containing three elements where the third element is `alp[rev_array[3:].count(rev_array[3]) - 1]`, `j` is 3**.
