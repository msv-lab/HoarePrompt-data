To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 2.
- `l` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `alp` is a predefined list of characters from 'a' to 'z'.
- `rev_array` is the reversed list of `array`.
- `ans` is an initially empty list that will contain the character `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`.
- `j` is 3.

The code snippet:
```python
ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
```

This line of code appends a character to the `ans` list. The character is determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist starting from index `j` to the end of `rev_array`, subtracting 1 from this count, and using the result as an index to access the `alp` list.

Let's denote:
- `rev_array[j]` as `x`.
- The count of `x` in `rev_array[j:]` as `count_x`.

The character appended to `ans` is `alp[count_x - 1]`.

Since the exact values of `array` and `rev_array` are not specified, we cannot determine the specific character that will be appended. However, we know that `ans` will now contain one additional element, which is a character from `alp`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one character from `alp`, `j` is 3.**
