The code snippet `rev_array = array[::-1]` creates a new list `rev_array` which is the reverse of the existing list `array`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `i`, `l`, `array`, or `alp`; it only introduces a new list `rev_array`.

Given the initial state, the output state will include the new list `rev_array` which is the reversed version of `array`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet letters, `rev_array` is the reversed list of `array`.**
