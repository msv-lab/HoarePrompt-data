The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input. Only `A` and `B` are used in the print statement.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(A * B)
```

This statement calculates the product of `A` and `B` and then prints it. Since the specific values of `A` and `B` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical result. However, we know that the output will be the product of these two integers.

Therefore, the output will be described as the product of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers read from the input)**
