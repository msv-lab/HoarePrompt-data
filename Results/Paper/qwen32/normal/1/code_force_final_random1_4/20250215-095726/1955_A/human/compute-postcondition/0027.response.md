Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input; `X` is not defined or retains its previous value if `B * 2 >= C`, otherwise `X` remains undefined or retains its previous value; `i` is k + 1. If `B * 2 < C`, `X` is not defined or retains its previous value. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, `X` is `A // 2`.**
