Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Program Analysis:

The program reads multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `n` (the number of yogurts), `a` (the price of one yogurt), and `b` (the price of two yogurts under promotion). It then calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts using the following logic:

1. If the cost of two yogurts (`b`) is greater than twice the cost of one yogurt (`2 * a`), it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Thus, the total cost is `n * a`.
2. If `n` is even, it is cheaper to buy pairs of yogurts at the promotional price. Thus, the total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
3. If `n` is odd, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and buys the remaining yogurt individually. Thus, the total cost is `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

### Potential Issues:

Let's check the provided program against the problem description and the given examples:

- **First condition:** `if B * 2 < C:` This condition is incorrect because it should check if `2 * a < b`, not `B * 2 < C`. The variable names are mixed up here. It should be `if 2 * a < b`.
  
- **Second condition:** `elif A % 2 == 0:` This part seems correct. If `n` is even, buying pairs at the promotional price is optimal.
  
- **Third condition:** `else:` This part also seems correct. If `n` is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt individually.

### Corrected Code:

Based on the above analysis, the corrected version of the code should be:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(n * a)
        elif n % 2 == 0:
            print(int(n * b / 2))
        else:
            X = n // 2
            print(X * b + a)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error due to the incorrect condition `if B * 2 < C:`. This means that the program might not always calculate the minimum cost correctly.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly checks the condition `if B * 2 < C:` instead of `if 2 * a < b:`. This leads to incorrect calculations for the minimum cost in some cases.
