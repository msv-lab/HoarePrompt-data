Let's carefully re-evaluate the logic and correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

### Problem Breakdown
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The cost of two yogurts with promotion is `b` burles.
- We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Logic Analysis
The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price per yogurt), and `b` (price for two yogurts with promotion).

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If `2*a < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them with the promotion. Hence, the total cost is `n * a`.
   - If `n` is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion, so the total cost is `(n/2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, the best strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible using the promotion and then buy the remaining yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `((n//2) * b) + a`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Since `2*5 = 10` is not less than `9`, the cost is `2 * 9 / 2 = 9`.
   - The program correctly outputs `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Since `2*5 = 10` is not less than `9`, the cost is `2 * 9 / 2 + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - The program correctly outputs `14`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Here, `2*5 = 10` is less than `11`, so the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - The program correctly outputs `15`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Since `2*5 = 10` is less than `11`, the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.
   - The program correctly outputs `20`.

### Re-evaluation of the Original Assessment
Upon closer inspection, the original assessment has a logical flaw in the condition checks and the handling of the cases when `2*a < b` is not met.

- **Condition `if B * 2 < C`:** This condition checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion. If true, the cost should indeed be `A * B`.
- **Condition `elif A % 2 == 0`:** This condition checks if `n` is even. If true, the cost should be `(A // 2) * C`.
- **Else Condition:** If `n` is odd, the cost should be `((A // 2) * C) + B`.

However, the original assessment incorrectly interprets the logic for the cases when `2*a >= b`. Specifically, the cost calculation for `n` being odd or even should always consider the promotion price `b` if it is cheaper than buying individual yogurts.

### Corrected Logic
The correct logic should be:
- If `2*a < b`, the cost is `n * a`.
- Otherwise, the cost is `((n // 2) * b) + (a if n % 2 != 0 else 0)`.

### Corrected Program
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            Y = A % 2
            print(X * C + Y * B)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Final Evaluation
The original program does not handle the cases correctly when `2*a >= b`. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
