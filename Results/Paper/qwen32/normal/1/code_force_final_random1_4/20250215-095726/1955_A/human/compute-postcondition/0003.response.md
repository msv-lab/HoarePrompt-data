Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- The current value of `B` is such that B * 2 is less than C.

The print statement is:
```python
print(A * B)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the expression `A * B`.

- `A` is an integer read from the input.
- `B` is also an integer read from the input, with the additional constraint that B * 2 < C.

Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

The print statement will output the product of `A` and `B`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers read from the input)**
