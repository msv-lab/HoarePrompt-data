### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their roles in solving the problem.

1. **Input Reading Functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_7`, `func_8`)**:
   - These functions handle reading input from standard input. They parse integers and lists of integers from the input. They are correctly implemented to handle the input format specified in the problem.

2. **Main Logic Function (`func_14`)**:
   - This function is responsible for generating the sequence `a` for each test case.
   - **Case when `k == 1`**:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 until the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - **Case when `k != 1`**:
     - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - It then appends `k-1 - sum(ans)`, `k+1`, and `2*k+1` to the sequence.
     - Finally, it continues appending powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - The goal is to ensure that all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` can be formed using subsequences of `a`.

3. **Driver Function (`func_15`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases using `func_10` and processes each test case using `func_14`.
   - It writes the results to standard output.

### Analysis of `func_14`:

- **Case when `k == 1`**:
  - The sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` ensures that all sums from `1` to `n` except `1` can be formed.
  - For `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` is correct because the only possible sum is `2`.

- **Case when `k != 1`**:
  - The sequence starts with powers of 2, ensuring that sums of these powers can be formed.
  - The additional elements `k-1 - sum(ans)`, `k+1`, and `2*k+1` help in forming sums that include `k+1` and `2*k+1` while avoiding `k`.
  - The remaining powers of 2 ensure that all sums up to `n` can be formed.

### Verification:

- The sequences generated by `func_14` are designed to satisfy the conditions:
  - No subsequence sums to `k`.
  - All other sums from `1` to `n` can be formed.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the implementation in `func_14` appears to correctly generate the required sequence for each test case. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
