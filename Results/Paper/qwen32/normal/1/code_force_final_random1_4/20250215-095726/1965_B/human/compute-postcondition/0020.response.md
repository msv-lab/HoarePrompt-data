The given code snippet appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value being appended to `ans`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only change is that `ans` now contains one additional element, which is `2 ** i`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 < k <= n; `b` is the binary string representation of `n`; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k`; `ans` is a list containing `[2 ** i]`; `lk` is the length of `bk`.**
