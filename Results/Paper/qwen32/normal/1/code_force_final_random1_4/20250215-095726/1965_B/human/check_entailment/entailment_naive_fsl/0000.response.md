Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
  - There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
  - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program defines several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_15`) and focuses on `func_14` which constructs the sequence `a` for each test case. Let's break down `func_14`:

#### Function `func_14`:
1. **Reading Input**: It reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Binary Representation**: Converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
3. **Handling Special Case `k == 1`**:
   - If `n == 2`, returns `[2]`.
   - Otherwise, initializes the sequence with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
4. **General Case**:
   - Initializes the sequence with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - Appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - Appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
   - Appends additional powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Verification:
1. **Special Case `k == 1`**:
   - For `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` works because the only possible sum is `2`, which is not `1`.
   - For other values of `n`, the sequence `[2, 3]` along with powers of 2 ensures that all sums except `1` are covered.

2. **General Case**:
   - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`. This ensures that all sums up to `k-1` can be formed.
   - The term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - Additional terms `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` along with further powers of 2 ensure that all sums up to `n` except `k` can be formed.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Small Values**: Test with small values of `n` and `k` to ensure correctness.
- **Large Values**: Test with large values of `n` and `k` to ensure the sequence does not exceed size 25 and meets the criteria.
- **Edge Cases**: Test with `k = 1` and `n = 2` specifically, as this is a special case handled separately.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program seems to handle all cases correctly. The constructed sequence ensures that all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` can be formed, and no subsequence sums to `k`.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly constructs the sequence `a` for each test case, ensuring that all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` can be formed, and no subsequence sums to `k`. The handling of special cases and general cases appears to be correct based on the provided logic.
