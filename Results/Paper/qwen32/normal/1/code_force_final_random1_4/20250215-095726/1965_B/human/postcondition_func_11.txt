The function `func_12` takes a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It recursively calculates a value based on the structure of `d` and the state of `processing`. If the list `d[da]` contains only one element, it returns 1. Otherwise, it explores each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed, updates the `processing` list, and computes the minimum value from recursive calls. This minimum value, incremented by 1, is then assigned to `rank[da - 1]` and returned.
