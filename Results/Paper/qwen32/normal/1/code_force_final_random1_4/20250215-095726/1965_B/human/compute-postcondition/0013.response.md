The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, `2 ** i` equals `2 ** 3` which is `8`. Therefore, the list `ans` will now include this new value.

Output State: **`k` equals 1, `n` is at least 4, `b` is the binary string representation of `n`, `l` is the length of `b` (which must be at least 3), `ans` is `[2, 3, 2, 4, 8]`, `i` is 3**.
