### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether the sequence generated by `func_14` meets the problem's requirements for all possible test cases. Let's break down the logic of `func_14` and analyze it against the problem description.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **No Subsequence Sum Equals \( k \)**: The sequence should not have any subsequence whose sum equals \( k \).
2. **Subsequences for All Values \( 1 \leq v \leq n \) Except \( k \)**: For every integer \( v \) from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \), there must exist a subsequence of the sequence that sums to \( v \).

#### Analysis of `func_14`:

1. **Case when \( k = 1 \)**:
   - If \( n = 2 \), the function returns the sequence `[2]`. Since \( k = 1 \), this satisfies the condition because no subsequence of `[2]` sums to 1.
   - Otherwise, the function returns `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` (powers of 2 starting from \( 2^1 \)). This sequence allows forming all sums from 1 to \( n \) except 1 itself, which satisfies the conditions.

2. **Case when \( k > 1 \)**:
   - The function constructs the sequence by appending powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( k \) minus one.
   - It then appends specific values to ensure the sum of certain subsequences does not equal \( k \):
     - `k - 1 - sum(ans)`: Ensures the sum of the initial part of the sequence does not reach \( k \).
     - `k + 1`: Adds a value just above \( k \).
     - `2 * k + 1`: Adds another value significantly larger than \( k \).
   - Finally, it continues appending powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of \( k \) onward.

#### Verification:
- **No Subsequence Sums to \( k \)**:
  - By carefully constructing the sequence to avoid sums equal to \( k \), the function ensures that no combination of elements sums to \( k \).
- **Subsequences for All Values \( 1 \leq v \leq n \) Except \( k \)**:
  - The inclusion of powers of 2 allows forming all sums up to a large number, ensuring that all values from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \) can be formed as subsequences.

Given the detailed construction and the nature of the problem, the sequence generated by `func_14` appears to satisfy both conditions for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program correctly generates sequences that meet the problem's requirements for all test cases.

**Correctness: True**
