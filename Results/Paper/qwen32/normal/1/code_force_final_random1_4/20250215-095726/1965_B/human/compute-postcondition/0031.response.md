The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `lk`, and `l`. Since `lk` is not mentioned as being modified within the loop or provided in the state, we will assume it remains constant. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `l`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is 32
- `k` is 10
- `b` is '100000'
- `l` is 6
- `bk` is '1010'
- `ans` is [2, 8, 16, 32, -49, 11, 21, 2]

And the loop:
```python
for i in range(lk, l):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been `l-1` (since the loop increments `i` until it reaches `l`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

However, since `lk` is not defined in the provided state, let's assume `lk` is 0 based on typical usage of `range` in loops. This means `i` would have started at 0 and incremented up to `l-1` (which is 5).

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 6, but since `l` is also 6, the loop condition `i < l` would no longer be satisfied, and the loop would terminate.

If we assume the loop has not yet reached its termination condition, then `i` should be incremented by 1 from its last value, which would be `lk + (number of iterations completed)`. Given `lk` is assumed to be 0 and 5 iterations have been completed, `i` should be 5 at the end of the last iteration, and thus should be 6 at the start of the next iteration. But since `i` reaching `l` terminates the loop, there is no valid next iteration possible with the given `l`.

Therefore, if we strictly follow the requirement to adjust states for one more iteration:
State: **`n` is 32, `k` is 10, `b` is '100000', `l` is 6, `bk` is '1010', `ans` is [2, 8, 16, 32, -49, 11, 21, 2], `i` is 5**

But since this would imply another iteration which is not possible, the loop would terminate, and no further valid state adjustment is possible for another iteration. 

So, the final state before termination would be:
State: **`n` is 32, `k` is 10, `b` is '100000', `l` is 6, `bk` is '1010', `ans` is [2, 8, 16, 32, -49, 11, 21, 2], `i` is 5**
