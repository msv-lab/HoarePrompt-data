Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - This sequence must satisfy two conditions:
     1. There should be no subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `k`.
     2. For every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `v`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and the pairs `(n, k)` for each test case.
   - It defines a function `func_1` which is supposed to generate the required sequences for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes a sequence `sequence` as `[2 ** i for i in range(25)]`, which is `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^24]`.
   - For each test case `(n, k)`, it appends the tuple `(25, sequence)` to the `results` list, meaning it returns the same sequence `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^24]` for every test case.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^24]`:**
   - This sequence is a set of powers of 2, which is known to be able to form any sum from 1 to \(2^{25} - 1\) using different combinations of its elements.
   - However, the sequence does not exclude the possibility of forming the sum `k`. Since `k` can be any value from 1 to `n`, this sequence might include `k` or a combination of its elements that sums to `k`.

4. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
     - This condition is not guaranteed to be satisfied by the sequence `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^24]` because `k` could be one of the elements in the sequence or a sum of some of its elements.
   - **Condition 2:** For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
     - This condition is satisfied because the sequence `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^24]` can form any sum from 1 to \(2^{25} - 1\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
