### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program's correctness based on the problem requirements and the annotated code.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:** The sequence `a` should not have any subsequence whose sum equals `k`.
2. **All Other Sums Possible:** For every integer `v` in the range `1 ≤ v ≤ n` except `v = k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

#### Program Analysis:

The main function responsible for generating the sequence is `func_14()`. Here's a detailed breakdown of its logic:

1. **Binary Representation**:
   - `b = bin(n)[2:]` and `l = len(b)` convert `n` to its binary form and get its length.
   - `bk = bin(k)[2:]` and `lk = len(bk)` do the same for `k`.

2. **Special Case `k = 1`**:
   - If `k = 1` and `n = 2`, the function returns `[2]`. This is correct because the only possible sums are `0` and `2`, and `1` cannot be formed.
   - Otherwise, it initializes the sequence with `[2, 3]` and continues to add powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **General Case (`k > 1`)**:
   - It initializes the sequence with powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
   - It then calculates the remaining value needed to avoid `k` and appends `k-1-sum(ans)` to the sequence.
   - It also appends `k+1` and `2*k+1` to ensure that all values up to `n` except `k` can be formed.
   - Finally, it continues appending powers of `2` from the length of the binary representation of `k` to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

#### Detailed Examination of the General Case:

Let's focus on the general case where `k > 1`:

- **Initialization with Powers of 2**:
  - The sequence starts with powers of `2` up to `2^(lk-2)`. This ensures that all sums up to `2^(lk-1) - 1` can be formed using these powers of `2`.

- **Avoiding Sum `k`**:
  - The term `k-1-sum(ans)` is added to the sequence. This term is designed to fill the gap between the sums that can be formed with the initial powers of `2` and `k`. The goal is to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
  - The terms `k+1` and `2*k+1` are added to ensure that sums greater than `k` can be formed.

- **Continuing with Powers of 2**:
  - The sequence continues with powers of `2` from `2^(lk)` to `2^(l-1)`. This ensures that all sums up to `n` can be formed, except for `k`.

#### Verification Against Examples:

Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **Example 1: `n = 2`, `k = 2`**
   - Output: `1\n1`
   - Explanation: The sequence `[1]` allows forming `1` but not `2`.

2. **Example 2: `n = 6`, `k = 1`**
   - Output: `5\n2 3 4 5 6`
   - Explanation: The sequence allows forming all numbers from `2` to `6` but not `1`.

3. **Example 3: `n = 8`, `k = 8`**
   - Output: `7\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Explanation: The sequence allows forming all numbers from `1` to `7` but not `8`.

4. **Example 4: `n = 9`, `k = 3`**
   - Output: `4\n7 1 4 1`
   - Explanation: The sequence allows forming all numbers from `1` to `9` except `3`.

5. **Example 5: `n = 10`, `k = 7`**
   - Output: `4\n1 2 8 3`
   - Explanation: The sequence allows forming all numbers from `1` to `10` except `7`.

#### Issues Identified:

Upon closer inspection, the general case logic seems flawed:

- **Negative Values**: In some cases, `k-1-sum(ans)` can result in negative values, which are invalid as per the problem constraints (non-negative integers).
- **Subsequence Formation**: The approach to avoid `k` while ensuring all other sums might not be robust enough. For instance, the addition of `k-1-sum(ans)` and subsequent terms might not guarantee that no subsequence sums to `k`.

#### Example with Issue:

Consider `n = 10` and `k = 7`:

- Binary representation of `n` is `1010` (length `l = 4`).
- Binary representation of `k` is `111` (length `lk = 3`).
- Initial sequence: `[2^0, 2^1] = [1, 2]`.
- `sum(ans) = 3`.
- `k-1-sum(ans) = 7-1-3 = 3` (valid).
- Sequence becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Add `k+1 = 8` and `2*k+1 = 15`.
- Sequence becomes `[1, 2, 3, 8, 15]`.
- Continue with `2^3 = 8` (already present).

This sequence does not guarantee that no subsequence sums to `7`. For instance, `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` if `4` were included.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, particularly the potential inclusion of negative values and the lack of robustness in avoiding the sum `k`, the program does not consistently meet the problem requirements.

**Final: False**
