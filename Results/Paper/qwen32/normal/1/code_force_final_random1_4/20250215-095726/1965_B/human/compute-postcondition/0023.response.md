The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `lk`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables change within the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(lk - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3. This means that the loop has already executed with `i` taking values from 0 up to 2 (since `range(lk - 1)` generates numbers from 0 to `lk - 2`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. However, for the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `lk - 1`.

Since `i` is now 4, the condition `i < lk - 1` must hold true for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `lk - 1` must be greater than 4, which implies `lk > 5`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `i` being 4 and `lk` being greater than 5.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 < k \leq n\); `b` is the binary string representation of `n`; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k`; `ans` is a list containing `[2, 8]`; `i` is 4; `lk` is greater than 5**
