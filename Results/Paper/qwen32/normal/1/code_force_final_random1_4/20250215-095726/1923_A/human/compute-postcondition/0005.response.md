The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and then finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in this reversed string. If '1' is not found, `y` will be -1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found

The variable `y` is introduced and assigned the value based on the reversed string `arr`. The value of `y` will be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.

To determine the exact value of `y`, we need to consider the position of '1' in the reversed string `arr`. If `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, then in the reversed string, the index of this '1' would be `len(arr) - x - 1` (if `x` is not -1).

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.**
