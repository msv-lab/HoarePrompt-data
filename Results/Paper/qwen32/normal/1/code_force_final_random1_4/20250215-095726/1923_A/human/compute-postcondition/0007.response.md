Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed.
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(z.count('0'))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine `arr`:**
   - `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed. For example, if the input string is `"001 010"`, then `arr` would be `"001010"`.

2. **Determine `x`:**
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - If `arr` is `"001010"`, the first '1' occurs at index 2, so `x = 2`.

3. **Determine `y`:**
   - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`.
   - Reversing `"001010"` gives `"010100"`. The first '1' in this reversed string is at index 1.
   - Since `y` is the index in the original string, we need to convert this index back to the original string. The index 1 in the reversed string corresponds to index `len(arr) - 1 - 1 = 4` in the original string.
   - So, `y = 4`.

4. **Determine `z`:**
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.
   - Given `x = 2` and `y = 4`, and assuming `n` is the length of `arr` (which is 6 in our example), `n - y = 6 - 4 = 2`.
   - Therefore, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index 2 to 2, which is just the character at index 2.
   - In our example, `arr[2]` is `'1'`, so `z = "1"`.

5. **Determine `z.count('0')`:**
   - `z.count('0')` counts the number of '0's in the substring `z`.
   - Since `z = "1"`, there are no '0's in `z`, so `z.count('0') = 0`.

### Final Output:
The `print(z.count('0'))` statement will print the number of '0's in the substring `z`.

Given the analysis, the output is:
Output: **0**
