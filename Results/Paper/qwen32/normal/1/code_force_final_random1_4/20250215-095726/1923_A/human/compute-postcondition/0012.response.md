The code snippet updates the value of `y` to be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed version of `arr`. If '1' is not found, `y` will be -1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\)
- `n` is the input integer
- `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found
- `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found
- `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1

After executing the line `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`, the value of `y` changes to reflect the new condition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\); `n` is the input integer; `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1.**
