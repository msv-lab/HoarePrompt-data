The code snippet reads an input string, removes any whitespace from it, and assigns the resulting string to the variable `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed.**
