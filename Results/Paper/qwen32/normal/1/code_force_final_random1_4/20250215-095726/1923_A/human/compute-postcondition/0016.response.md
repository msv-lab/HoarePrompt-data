The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input(''))
```

This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `z`) are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 998\)
- `n` is the input integer (this will be overwritten)
- `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found
- `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found
- `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1

After executing the code snippet, the new value of `n` will be the integer input provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 998\); `n` is the input integer; `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1.**
