The provided code snippet reassigns `arr` to the result of removing all whitespace from the input string. This means the value of `arr` changes, but the other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged unless they are dependent on `arr`.

Given the initial state, `arr` is reassigned to the input string with all whitespace removed. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` depend on the original `arr`, their values might need recalculating if `arr` changes, but the code does not perform those recalculations. Therefore, `x`, `y`, and `z` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\); `n` is the input integer; `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1.**
