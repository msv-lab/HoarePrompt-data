### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cells) and the ribbon configuration as a string of '0's and '1's.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first '1' (chip) in the ribbon.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the last '1' (chip) in the ribbon by reversing the string and finding the first '1', then converting this index back to the original string's indexing.

3. **Extracting the Relevant Section:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip (inclusive).

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the substring from the first to the last chip.

### Analysis:

- The key idea here is to count the number of free cells between the first and last chip. This count represents the minimum number of moves needed to bring all chips together into a contiguous block.
- The logic seems correct because moving each chip to the leftmost available position until they form a block is equivalent to counting the free cells between the first and last chip.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's verify with the first example provided:

- **Input:** `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
- **First Chip (`x`):** At index 1.
- **Last Chip (`y`):** At index 6 (from the end, which corresponds to index 1 in the original string when reversed).
- **Relevant Section (`z`):** From index 1 to 6, which is `1 1 1 0 1 1`.
- **Free Cells (`z.count('0')`):** There is 1 free cell in this section.

This matches the expected output of 1.

### Conclusion:

The code appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
