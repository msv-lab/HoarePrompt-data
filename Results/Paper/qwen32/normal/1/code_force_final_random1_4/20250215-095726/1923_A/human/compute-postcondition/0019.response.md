The code snippet updates the value of `y` to be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed version of `arr`. 

Given the initial state, `y` was previously defined as the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found. However, the code reassigns `y` using `arr[::-1].find('1')`, which means `y` will now hold the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`.

Since the operation does not affect `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, or `z`, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 998\); `n` is the input integer; `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1.**
