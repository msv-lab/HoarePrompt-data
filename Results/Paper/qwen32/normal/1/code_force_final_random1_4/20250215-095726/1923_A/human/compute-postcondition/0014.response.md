Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variable Definitions**:
   - `t`: An integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\). This variable does not affect the output directly.
   - `n`: The length of the input string `arr` after removing all whitespace.
   - `arr`: The input string with all whitespace removed.
   - `x`: The index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
   - `y`: The index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
   - `z`: The substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1.

2. **Understanding `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is the index of the first '1' in the original string `arr`.
   - `y` is the index of the first '1' in the reversed string `arr`. This means `y` corresponds to the last '1' in the original string `arr`.

3. **Understanding `z`**:
   - If `x` is -1, it means there is no '1' in the string, so `z` is an empty string.
   - If `x` is not -1, `z` is the substring from the first '1' (`x`) to `n - y`. Here, `n - y` is the index just after the last '1' in the original string.

4. **Counting '0's in `z`**:
   - The `print(z.count('0'))` statement counts the number of '0's in the substring `z`.

### Detailed Steps:

- **Case 1: No '1' in `arr`**:
  - `x = -1`
  - `z` becomes an empty string.
  - `z.count('0')` will be 0 because there are no characters in `z`.

- **Case 2: At least one '1' in `arr`**:
  - `x` is the index of the first '1'.
  - `y` is the index of the last '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to `n - y - 1` in the original string.
  - `z` is the substring from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
  - `z.count('0')` counts the number of '0's in this substring.

### Final Output:

Based on the above analysis, the output depends on the presence and positions of '1's in the string `arr`. If there are no '1's, `z` is an empty string and the count of '0's is 0. If there are '1's, `z` is the substring between the first and last '1', and the count of '0's in this substring is what gets printed.

Output: **the number of '0's in the substring `z` (where `z` is the substring from the first '1' to the last '1' in `arr`, or an empty string if there are no '1's in `arr`)**
