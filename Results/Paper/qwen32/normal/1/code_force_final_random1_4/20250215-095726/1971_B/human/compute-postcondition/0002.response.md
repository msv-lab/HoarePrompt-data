The code snippet `s = input()` reads a new string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. This means that the previous value of `s` (which was a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters) is replaced by whatever new string is provided as input.

The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.
