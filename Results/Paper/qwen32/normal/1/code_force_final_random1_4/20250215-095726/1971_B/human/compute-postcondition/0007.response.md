Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the new input string.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`.
- The number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `a` do not influence what is printed because the print statement does not reference these variables. It directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
