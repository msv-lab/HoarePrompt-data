Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters; `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` is 2, then no additional changes are made to `s`. Otherwise, `b` is the string `s` sorted alphabetically, `c` is the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order, and if `b` is equal to `s`, then `s` is already sorted alphabetically; otherwise, `s` is not sorted alphabetically.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new input string `s`, `b` is the original `s` sorted alphabetically, `c` is the original `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order, and if `b` is equal to the original `s`, then the original `s` is already sorted alphabetically; otherwise, the original `s` is not sorted alphabetically, `i` is `i + 1`. Regardless of whether the length of `a` is 2 or not, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new input string `s`, `b` is the original `s` sorted alphabetically, `c` is the original `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order. If `b` is equal to the original `s`, then the original `s` is already sorted alphabetically; otherwise, the original `s` is not sorted alphabetically. `i` is `i + 1`. Additionally, if the length of `a` is 2, the specific behavior of the if part is implied, but it does not change the described properties of the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
