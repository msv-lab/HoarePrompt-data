### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 representing the time in 24-hour format.

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes:**
   - The first two characters of `s` (`s[:2]`) are extracted and stored in `h`, representing the hour.
   - The remaining part of the string (`s[2:]`) represents the minutes.

3. **Converting Hours:**
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it prints `'12'` (midnight).
   - If `h` is between `'01'` and `'12'` (inclusive), it prints `h` as is.
   - If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it subtracts 12 from the integer value of `h` and formats it to have a leading zero if necessary.

4. **Printing Minutes and AM/PM:**
   - The minutes part (`s[2:]`) is printed directly.
   - The program uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` to determine whether to print `'AM'` or `'PM'`. It checks if `h` is greater than or equal to `'12'` to decide the index.

### Issues Identified:

- **Incorrect Conversion Logic for Hours Greater Than 12:**
  - When `h` is greater than `'12'`, the program incorrectly formats the hour by prepending `'0'` to the result of `int(h) - 12`. This can lead to incorrect formatting for hours like `'13'` (which should be `'01'` in 12-hour format but the program would output `'01'` without the leading zero check).
  
- **Handling Midnight and Noon:**
  - Midnight (`'00'`) is correctly converted to `'12 AM'`.
  - Noon (`'12'`) is correctly converted to `'12 PM'`.

### Corrected Conversion Logic:

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the hour conversion handles leading zeros correctly:

```python
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = int(s[:2])
        
        if h == 0:
            h_12 = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h_12 = h - 12
        else:
            h_12 = h
        
        print(f"{h_12:02}{s[2:]} {'AM' if h < 12 else 'PM'}")
```

### Conclusion:

The original program does not handle the conversion of hours greater than 12 correctly due to improper formatting. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
