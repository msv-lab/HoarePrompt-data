Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1439; `s` is the new string input by the user; `h` is the first two characters of the current `s`. If `h` is '00', the program follows the if part logic. Otherwise, if `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, the program follows the if part logic. In all other cases, the program follows the else part logic. In all scenarios, the values of `t`, `s`, and `h` remain unchanged.**
