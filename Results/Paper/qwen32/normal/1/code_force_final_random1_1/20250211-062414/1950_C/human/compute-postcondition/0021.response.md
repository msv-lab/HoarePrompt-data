Let's break down the code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed:

1. **Variable `t`:** This is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1440. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output of the print statement.

2. **Variable `s`:** This is a new string input by the user. The exact content of this string is not specified, but we know it must be at least 3 characters long since the code accesses `s[2:]`.

3. **Variable `h`:** This is the first two characters of the string `s`. Depending on the value of `h`:
   - If `h` equals '00', it remains '00'.
   - If `h` does not equal '00', then:
     - If the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, `h` is less than or equal to 12.
     - If the integer value of `h` is greater than 12, `h` is greater than 12.

4. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
   ```
   - `s[2:]` extracts the substring of `s` starting from the third character to the end.
   - `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` evaluates the condition `int(h) >= 12`:
     - If `int(h) >= 12` is `True`, it selects `'PM'`.
     - If `int(h) >= 12` is `False`, it selects `'AM'`.

### Explanation:
- The first part of the output, `s[2:]`, will be the substring of `s` starting from the third character to the end.
- The second part of the output, `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`, depends on the value of `h`:
  - If `h` is '00' or any value less than '12', it will print `'AM'`.
  - If `h` is any value greater than or equal to '12', it will print `'PM'`.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `s = "09:30 AM"`, then `h = "09"` and `int(h) < 12`, so the output will be `"30 AM"`.
- If `s = "13:45 PM"`, then `h = "13"` and `int(h) >= 12`, so the output will be `"45 PM"`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be a combination of the substring of `s` starting from the third character and either `'AM'` or `'PM'` based on the value of `h`.

Output: **s[2:] [either 'AM' or 'PM'] (where s[2:] is the substring of s starting from the third character and 'AM' or 'PM' is determined by whether the integer value of the first two characters of s is less than 12 or not)**
