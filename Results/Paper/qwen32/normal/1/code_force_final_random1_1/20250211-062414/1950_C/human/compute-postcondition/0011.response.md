Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440; `s` is the string input by the user; `h` is the first two characters of `s`. If `h` equals '00', then `h` remains '00'. Otherwise, `h` does not equal '00' and if the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `h` is less than or equal to 12. Otherwise, `h` is greater than 12.**
