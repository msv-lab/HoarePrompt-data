Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1440. For each test case, it receives a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm). The function returns the processed result for each test case based on the given time.**
