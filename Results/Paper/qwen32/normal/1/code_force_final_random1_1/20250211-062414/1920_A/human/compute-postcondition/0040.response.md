The given Python code snippet initializes a variable `count_num` to 0. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `start`, `end`, or `num`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1` encountered, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2` encountered, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered, `count_num` is 0.**
