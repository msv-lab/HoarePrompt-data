Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1` encountered, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2` encountered, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered and contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `count_num` is incremented by 1.**
