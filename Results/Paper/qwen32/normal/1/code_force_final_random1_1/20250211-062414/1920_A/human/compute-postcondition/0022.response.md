Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is `v` if `start` was originally less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged. `v` is the second integer from the input, `end` is updated to `v` if `end` was originally greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is equal to 3, `num` is a list containing `[v]`; otherwise, `num` remains an empty list. `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from the input.**
