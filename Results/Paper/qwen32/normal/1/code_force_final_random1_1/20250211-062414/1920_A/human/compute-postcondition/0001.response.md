The code snippet provided sets the variable `start` to -1. This does not affect the values of `n`, `end`, `num`, `t`, or `v`. Since `start` was already initialized to -1 in the initial state, setting it again to -1 does not change its value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list that will store integers, `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3 representing the type of constraint, and `v` is an integer representing the value of the constraint.**
