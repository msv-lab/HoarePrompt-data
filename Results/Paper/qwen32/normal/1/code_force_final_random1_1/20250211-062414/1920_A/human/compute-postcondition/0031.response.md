The code snippet `start = v` assigns the value of `v` to the variable `start`. This means that regardless of the original condition of `start`, it will now hold the value of `v`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `start` is `v`; `end` is updated to `v` if `t` is equal to 2 and `end` was originally greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0; `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3 or `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3; `i` is 2; `t` and `v` are the integers read from the input.**
