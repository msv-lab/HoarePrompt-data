Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is `v` if `start` was originally less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged, `end` is updated to `v` if `t` is equal to 2 and `end` was originally greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0, `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3 or `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from the input.**
