Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1` encountered, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2` encountered, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`. Additionally, `start` is less than or equal to `end`.**
