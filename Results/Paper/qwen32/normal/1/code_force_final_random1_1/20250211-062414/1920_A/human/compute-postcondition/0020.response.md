The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `t` and `v`. This affects the values of `t` and `v` but does not change the other variables unless they depend on `t` or `v`.

Given the initial state, `t` and `v` will be updated based on the input. The other variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, `num`, `i`) remain unchanged unless their definitions depend on `t` or `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is either -1 or `v` depending on whether `start` was originally less than `v`, `v` is the second integer from the input, `end` is updated to `v` if `end` was originally greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is equal to 3, `num` is a list containing `[v]`; otherwise, `num` remains an empty list, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input.**
