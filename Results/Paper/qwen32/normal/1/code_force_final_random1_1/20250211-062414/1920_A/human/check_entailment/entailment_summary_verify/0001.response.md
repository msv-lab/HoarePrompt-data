Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to ensure the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It then iterates over the `n` constraints and processes them accordingly.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - The program initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000. These variables represent the minimum and maximum possible values for `k`, respectively.
   - It also initializes an empty list `num` to store values that `k` cannot be (i.e., constraints of type 3).
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`t == 1`), it updates `start` to be the maximum of its current value and `v`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`t == 2`), it updates `end` to be the minimum of its current value and `v`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`t == 3`), it appends `v` to the `num` list.

3. **Counting Valid Values**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `start` is greater than `end`. If so, it returns 0 because it's impossible for `k` to satisfy both the lower and upper bounds.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of integers from `start` to `end` inclusive, which is `end - start + 1`.
   - It then subtracts the count of numbers in the `num` list that fall within this range (`count_num`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `start > end` correctly by returning 0.
   - It also correctly counts and subtracts the numbers that `k` cannot be, ensuring that they are not included in the final count.

### Verification with Example Input:

Let's verify the program with the example input provided:

#### Test Case 1:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
- `start` becomes 3.
- `end` becomes 10.
- `num` becomes `[1, 5]`.
- Valid `k` values: `[3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
- Output: `7`.

#### Test Case 2:
```
2
1 5
2 4
```
- `start` becomes 5.
- `end` becomes 4.
- `num` is empty.
- Since `start > end`, output: `0`.

#### Test Case 3:
```
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
- `start` becomes 7.
- `end` becomes 98.
- `num` becomes `[6, 7, 100, 44, 99]`.
- Valid `k` values: `[7, 8, 9, ..., 98]` excluding `[7, 44, 99]`.
- Output: `90`.

#### Test Case 4:
```
6
1 5
2 10
1 9
2 2
3 2
3 9
```
- `start` becomes 9.
- `end` becomes 2.
- `num` becomes `[2, 9]`.
- Since `start > end`, output: `0`.

#### Test Case 5:
```
5
1 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
3 3
```
- `start` becomes 1.
- `end` becomes 2.
- `num` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
- No valid `k` values.
- Output: `0`.

#### Test Case 6:
```
6
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
- `start` becomes 100,000,000.
- `end` becomes 900,000,000.
- `num` becomes `[500,000,000, 10,000, 900,000,001]`.
- Valid `k` values: `[100,000,000, 100,000,001, ..., 900,000,000]` excluding `[100,000,000, 500,000,000]`.
- Output: `800,000,000`.

### Correctness Check:

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as verified by the example inputs. However, there is a subtle issue in the logic when calculating the number of valid `k` values.

In the function `func_7`, the calculation of the number of valid `k` values is:
```python
return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
```

This logic is mostly correct, but let's consider a scenario where `end - start + 1 < count_num`. In such a case, the program should indeed return 0, which it does. However, the condition `end - start + 1 >= count_num` ensures that the subtraction does not result in a negative number, which is correct.

However, there is another potential issue. If `start` and `end` are set such that `end - start + 1` is very large, and `count_num` is also large, the subtraction could lead to an incorrect result if not handled properly. But given the constraints, this is unlikely to happen.

### Final Evaluation:

After careful analysis, the program appears to correctly handle all the constraints and edge cases as verified by the example inputs. The logic seems sound and the function summary aligns with the expected behavior.

Final: **True**
