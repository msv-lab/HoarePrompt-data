The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, none of the variables `n`, `start`, `end`, `num`, or `i` will be changed by this statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1` encountered, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2` encountered, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered and contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`.**
