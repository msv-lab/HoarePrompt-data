### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the provided functions to see if they correctly solve the problem described.

1. **Function `func_1`:** This function reads the number of test cases from the input. It works correctly as per the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`:** This function reads a line of input and processes it into a list of integers or strings based on the parameters. However, this function is not used in the main code snippet provided, so we can ignore it for now.

3. **Function `func_3`:** This function concatenates elements of a list into a string with a specified separator. This function is also not used in the main code snippet, so we can ignore it for now.

4. **Function `func_4`:** This function finds all occurrences of a substring within a string. This function is not used in the main code snippet, so we can ignore it for now.

5. **Function `func_5`:** This function finds all indices of a specific element in a list. This function is not used in the main code snippet, so we can ignore it for now.

6. **Function `func_6`:** This function searches for a sub-array in a 2D list where a specific column index matches a given value. This function is not used in the main code snippet, so we can ignore it for now.

7. **Function `func_7`:** This function is crucial as it handles the logic for each test case. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what it does:
   - It reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000 (which is the maximum possible value for `x`).
   - It iterates over each constraint:
     - If the constraint type is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `start` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `end` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 3 (k must be not equal to x), it adds `x` to a list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it counts how many numbers in the range `[start, end]` are in the `num` list (i.e., numbers that cannot be `k`).
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there is no valid `k` and it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of valid `k` values as `end - start + 1 - count_num` (the size of the range minus the numbers that cannot be `k`). If the calculated value is negative, it returns 0.

The logic in `func_7` correctly implements the problem requirements. It ensures that the range `[start, end]` is valid and correctly counts the numbers that cannot be `k`.

### Conclusion:

Since `func_7` correctly implements the logic to solve the problem for each test case, and the other functions are not used in the main logic, the overall program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
