The code snippet provided does not change any of the variables `n`, `start`, `num`, `t`, or `v`. It only reassigns the variable `end` to the value `1000000000.0`, which is the same value it already holds according to the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the confirmation that `end` is indeed `1000000000.0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list that will store integers, `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3 representing the type of constraint, and `v` is an integer representing the value of the constraint.**
