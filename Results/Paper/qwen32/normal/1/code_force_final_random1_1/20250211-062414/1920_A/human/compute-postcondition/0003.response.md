The code snippet `num = []` initializes the list `num` to be an empty list. This affects the variable `num` by changing its value from whatever it was (as per the initial state, it's a list that will store integers) to an empty list. The other variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, `t`, and `v`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is [], `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3 representing the type of constraint, and `v` is an integer representing the value of the constraint.**
