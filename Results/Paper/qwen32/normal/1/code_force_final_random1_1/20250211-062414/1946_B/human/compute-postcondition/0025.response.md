Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing the integers 0, `l[0]`, `l[0] + l[1]`, ..., `l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]`; `smin` is a list containing the integers 0 and either `suf[i + 1]` (if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`) or 0 (if `suf[i + 1]` is not less than `smin[i]`), with an additional element equal to `suf[4]` if `suf[4] < smin[3]`, otherwise an additional element equal to `smin[3]`; `i` is 3.**
