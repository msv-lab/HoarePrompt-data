The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given the initial state, `smin` initially contains only one element `[0]`. After appending `suf[i + 1]`, `smin` will contain two elements: `[0, suf[i + 1]]`.

The values of `suf`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The condition `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]` is also still valid because `smin[i]` now refers to the newly added element `suf[i + 1]`, and the condition is evaluated before the append operation.

Output State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `i` is `n`, `smin` is `[0, suf[i + 1]]`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`.**
