Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

The code snippet is:
```python
a = abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `sm` is `2 + (l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1])` and its current value is less than 0.
- `a` is not defined before this line.

Since `sm` is less than 0, `abs(sm)` will convert `sm` to its positive equivalent. Let's denote the absolute value of `sm` as `|sm|`.

The operation `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)` computes the integer division of `|sm|` by `10 ** 9 + 7` (which is a large prime number, often used in competitive programming for modulo operations).

Thus, `a` will be assigned the result of this integer division.

No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `suf` is a list containing elements `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that point, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `j + n`, `sm` is `2 + (l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1])` and its current value is less than 0, `a` is `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.
