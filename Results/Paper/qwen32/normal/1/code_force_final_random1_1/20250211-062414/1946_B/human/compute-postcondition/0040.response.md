The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4;
- `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0;
- `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`;
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9;
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input;
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input;
- `suf` is a list containing the integers 0, `l[0]`, `l[0] + l[1]`, ..., `l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]`;
- `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum;
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value;
- if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is updated to the difference `suf[i] - smin[i]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. To start the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 again.

So, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing the integers 0, `l[0]`, `l[0] + l[1]`, ..., `l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]`; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum; `i` is 4; if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is updated to the difference `suf[i] - smin[i]`.**
