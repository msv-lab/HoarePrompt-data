To determine what will be printed by the `print(sm)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b` and must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element of the list `b`.
   - `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `suf` is a list containing cumulative sums starting from 0 up to the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers, where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum.
   - `sm` is a variable that undergoes specific updates based on certain conditions.
     - If `sm` is less than 0, `a` is set to the absolute value of `sm` divided by 10.
     - Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10^9 + 7)` and `a` remains unchanged.

2. **Determining the Value of `sm`:**
   - The value of `sm` depends on the conditions mentioned above.
   - Since the exact values of `l` and the cumulative sums in `suf` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `sm` directly.
   - However, we know that `sm` is either updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10^9 + 7)` if it is not less than 0, or it remains unchanged if it is less than 0.

3. **Final Output:**
   - Given the information, the value of `sm` will be either `(2 + suf[n]) % (10^9 + 7)` or its original value if it was less than 0.
   - Since we don't have the exact values of `suf[n]` and the initial value of `sm`, we can only describe the value of `sm` in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print(sm)` statement will be described as follows:

Output: **sm (where sm is either (2 + suf[n]) % (10^9 + 7) if it was not less than 0, or its original value if it was less than 0)**
