`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
