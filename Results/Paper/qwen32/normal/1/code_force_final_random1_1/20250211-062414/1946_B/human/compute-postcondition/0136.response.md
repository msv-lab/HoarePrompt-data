Postcondition: **`sm` is either updated to a value greater than its previous value `(suf[i] - smin[i])` or remains `-111`. The list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` remains unchanged. `n` is at least 0. The current value of `sm` is such that `(suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111)` is true.**
