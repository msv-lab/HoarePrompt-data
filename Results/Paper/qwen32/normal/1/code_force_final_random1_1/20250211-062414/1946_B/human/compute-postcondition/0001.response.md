To determine the necessary adjustments for the given loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for j in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `j` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `t`. Therefore, if `t` is 1 or greater, the loop will execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9

We need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. Since the problem statement already specifies that `t` is within the range 1 to 10^4, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `j` is initialized automatically by the `range` function and does not need to be set manually before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state remains as provided, with the only requirement being that `t` is at least 1, which is already satisfied by the given constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
