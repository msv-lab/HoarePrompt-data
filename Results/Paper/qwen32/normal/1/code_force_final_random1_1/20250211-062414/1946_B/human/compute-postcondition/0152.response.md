The code modifies the value of `sm` by taking its modulus with \(10^9 + 7\). This operation ensures that `sm` remains within a specific range, which is a common practice in programming to prevent integer overflow and to meet certain problem constraints.

Given the initial state, the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n` remains unchanged. Similarly, the relationship between `sm` and `suf[n]` before the modulus operation also remains valid, except that `sm` is now adjusted to be within the bounds defined by the modulus operation.

Output State: **the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n`; `sm` is `(sm * 2 + suf[n]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0**.
