The given code modifies the value of `sm` by taking its modulo with \(10^9 + 7\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `suf` is a list containing elements `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that point, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `j + n`, `sm` is `(2 + (l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1])) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**
