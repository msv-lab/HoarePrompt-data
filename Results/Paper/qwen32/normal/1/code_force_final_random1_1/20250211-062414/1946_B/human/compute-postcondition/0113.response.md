To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 0.
- `suf` has a new element which is `suf[i] + l[i]` appended to it.

From the loop statement:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `n` does not change within the loop, it remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

However, we do not have the exact value of `i_prev`, but we know it must be incremented by 1. Since the problem doesn't specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the state in terms of the increment.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

If we assume `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then the state can be more precisely stated as:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

But since we don't have `i_prev`, the most accurate representation based on the given information is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
