The code snippet provided sets `suf` to an empty list. This means that the previous list `suf` containing the cumulative sums is replaced with an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is an empty list; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum; if `sm` is less than 0, `a` is set to the absolute value of `sm` divided by 10. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10^9 + 7)` and `a` remains unchanged; `j` is `j + 1`.**
