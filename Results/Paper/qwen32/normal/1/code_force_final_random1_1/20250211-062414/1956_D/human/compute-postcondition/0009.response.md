To determine what will be printed by the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **List `a`**: It is a list of integers. The exact values of the integers in the list are not specified, so we cannot determine them explicitly.

2. **Integer `n`**: This is an input integer. Its exact value is also not specified.

3. **Function `func_2(a)`**: This function returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`. The exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, so we do not know how these values are computed from the list `a`.

4. **Variable `ops`**: It is a list of tuples returned by `func_2(a)`. We know that `ops` must contain at least three tuples.

5. **Variables `l` and `r`**: These are derived from the third tuple in the `ops` list. Specifically, `l` is the first element of the third tuple, and `r` is the second element of the third tuple.

Given this information, we can infer the following about the `print` statement:
- `l` and `r` are elements of the third tuple in the `ops` list.
- The `print` statement outputs `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of their positions in the `ops` list. Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l is the first element of the third tuple in ops and r is the second element of the third tuple in ops)**
