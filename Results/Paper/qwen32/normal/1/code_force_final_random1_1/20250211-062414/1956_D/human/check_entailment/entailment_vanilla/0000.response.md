Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to handle the case when the subarray from index `l` to `r` needs to be modified to maximize the sum.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if the single element at index `l` is not 0. If it's not, it sets this element to 0 and adds the operation to the list.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the next index (`l + 1`) and then checks if the current element `a[l]` is not equal to the size of the subarray (`r - l + 1`). If not, it performs the MEX operation and updates the subarray elements accordingly.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
   - It returns the final sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function is supposed to recursively split the array into subarrays and apply the MEX operation to maximize the sum.
   - It calculates the sum of the current subarray and compares it with the potential maximum sum if all elements were set to `r - l + 1`.
   - If the current sum is less than or equal to the potential maximum sum, it calls `func_1` to perform the MEX operation.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and splits the array around this maximum element, recursively processing the left and right parts.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes the array using `func_2`, and prints the result.

### Issues Identified:

- **Global Variable `ops`**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` uses a variable `ops` which is not defined within its scope. This variable should be passed as an argument to the function.
- **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is called inside `recursive_maximize_sum`, but it doesn't correctly update the array or operations list in a way that maximizes the sum.
- **Logic Error in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: The logic to determine whether to call `func_1` or split the array is flawed. It should ensure that the MEX operation is applied correctly to maximize the sum.
- **Output Format**: The function `func_3` correctly formats the output, but the underlying logic issues mean the output may not be correct.

### Conclusion:

Given the identified issues, particularly the incorrect handling of the operations list and the flawed logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
