### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return sum(a), len(ops), ops
```
- **Issue Identified:** The `ops` list is initialized within `func_2` but `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing `ops` as an argument. Therefore, `recursive_maximize_sum` cannot modify `ops`, leading to a `NameError` when `ops` is referenced inside `recursive_maximize_sum`.
- **Annotation Insight:** The annotation states that `ops` is not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, confirming the issue.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
```python
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l):
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if (pos != r):
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
```
- **Issue Identified:** `ops` is used inside `recursive_maximize_sum` without being passed as an argument, leading to a `NameError`.
- **Annotation Insight:** The annotation confirms that `ops` is not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, leading to the `NameError`.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if (l == r):
        if (a[l] != 0):
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if (a[l] != r - l + 1):
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
```
- **Issue Identified:** The logic in `func_1` is flawed. When `l == r`, it sets `a[l]` to `0` if `a[l]` is not `0`, which is incorrect since the goal is to maximize the sum. Additionally, the logic of setting `a[l]` to `r - l + 1` is not aligned with the MEX operation.
- **Annotation Insight:** The annotation confirms the behavior of `func_1` but does not address the logical flaws.

### Overall Analysis:
The primary issues identified in the original assessment are correct:
1. **Unpassed Argument (`ops`):** The `ops` list is not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, leading to a `NameError`.
2. **Incorrect Logic:** The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` does not correctly implement the MEX operation or maximize the sum as intended.

These issues are confirmed by the annotations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
