To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand that the loop iterates over each tuple in the `ops` list. Each iteration prints the incremented values of `l` and `r` from each tuple in `ops`.

Given the pattern described in the problem, the loop will continue until it has processed all tuples in `ops`. Therefore, the final output state will be reached when all tuples in `ops` have been printed.

Here's the breakdown:
- The loop iterates over each tuple `(l, r)` in `ops`.
- For each tuple, it prints `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

After all tuples have been processed, there are no more tuples left in `ops` to iterate over. Thus, the final state will be the same as the initial state except that all tuples in `ops` will have been printed.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, and all tuples in `ops` have been printed.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that the loop has completed all its iterations, printing `l + 1` and `r + 1` for each tuple `(l, r)` in `ops`, and the values of `a`, `n`, `s`, `m`, and `ops` remain unchanged from their initial state except that `ops` has been fully consumed by the loop.
