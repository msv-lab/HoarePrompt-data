You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if a[l] != r - l + 1:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

#Function 2:
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []

    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

#Function 3:
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)

#Function 4:
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the input, processes the list using `func_2`, and prints two values `s` and `m` followed by a series of operations. The final state includes the printed values `s`, `m`, and the operations derived from processing the list `a`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Code

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`
- This function seems to be designed to handle the case when the subarray from index `l` to `r` needs to be modified to maximize the sum.
- If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not zero. If not, it sets `a[l]` to zero and records the operation.
- For the general case (`l < r`), it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`. After returning from the recursion, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1` (which is the MEX of the subarray). If not, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
- However, the logic here seems flawed because it doesn't correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and directly assigns `r - l + 1` without ensuring that it is indeed the smallest missing non-negative integer.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a)`
- This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
- It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

#### Function 3: `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`
- This function is supposed to recursively maximize the sum of the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
- It calculates the sum of the subarray and checks if it is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` to modify the subarray and sets all elements to `r - l + 1`.
- Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of the maximum element.
- The issue here is that the condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a reliable way to determine whether the subarray needs modification. Also, `func_1` is called incorrectly since it expects `ops` to be passed as an argument.

#### Function 4: `func_3()`
- This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The functions do not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray. They simply assign `r - l + 1` to the subarray, which is not necessarily the smallest missing non-negative integer.
2. **Incorrect Use of `ops`**: The `ops` list is not properly passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, leading to undefined behavior.
3. **Flawed Logic for Maximizing Sum**: The logic used to decide whether to modify a subarray and how to do it is flawed and does not guarantee the maximum possible sum.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
