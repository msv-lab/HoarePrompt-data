### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided code and the original assessment based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`
- This function is intended to handle the case where the subarray from index `l` to `r` needs to be modified to maximize the sum.
- If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not zero. If not, it sets `a[l]` to zero and records the operation.
- For the general case (`l < r`), it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`. After returning from the recursion, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1` (which is supposed to be the MEX of the subarray). If not, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
- The flaw here is that `r - l + 1` is not necessarily the MEX of the subarray. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, which might be smaller than `r - l + 1`.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a)`
- This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
- It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
- The issue here is that `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which leads to undefined behavior.

#### Function 3: `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`
- This function is supposed to recursively maximize the sum of the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
- It calculates the sum of the subarray and checks if it is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` to modify the subarray and sets all elements to `r - l + 1`.
- Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of the maximum element.
- The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a reliable way to determine whether the subarray needs modification. Also, `func_1` is called incorrectly since it expects `ops` to be passed as an argument.

#### Function 4: `func_3()`
- This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
- The function summary indicates that `func_3` handles input and output correctly, but the underlying functions have issues.

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The functions do not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray. They simply assign `r - l + 1` to the subarray, which is not necessarily the smallest missing non-negative integer.
2. **Incorrect Use of `ops`**: The `ops` list is not properly passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, leading to undefined behavior.
3. **Flawed Logic for Maximizing Sum**: The logic used to decide whether to modify a subarray and how to do it is flawed and does not guarantee the maximum possible sum.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying these issues. The program does not correctly compute the MEX and does not handle the operations list properly, leading to incorrect results.
