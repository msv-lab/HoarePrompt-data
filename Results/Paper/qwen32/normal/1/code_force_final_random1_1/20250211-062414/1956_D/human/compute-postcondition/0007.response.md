To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `a` is a list of integers.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.
4. `ops` must contain at least two tuples.
5. `l` is `l_next` (the first element of the second tuple in `ops`).
6. `r` is `r_next` (the second element of the second tuple in `ops`).

Given this, we need to focus on the second tuple in `ops` because `l` and `r` are derived from it. Specifically:
- `l` is the first element of the second tuple in `ops`.
- `r` is the second element of the second tuple in `ops`.

The `print` statement outputs `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Since we do not have the exact values of `ops`, we can only describe the output in terms of the values of `l` and `r` derived from `ops`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l is the first element of the second tuple in ops and r is the second element of the second tuple in ops)**
