Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a). `s` is the sum of the elements from index l to r (inclusive) in the list a, and s > (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1]. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.**
