To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, m)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and analyze the components:

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.

Since the function `func_2` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `s` and `m` without knowing what `func_2` does. However, we can describe the output in terms of what `func_2` returns.

Given that `s` and `m` are returned by `func_2(a)`, the `print(s, m)` statement will output the values of `s` and `m` as they are determined by the function `func_2`.

Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **s, m (where s and m are the values returned by func_2(a))**
