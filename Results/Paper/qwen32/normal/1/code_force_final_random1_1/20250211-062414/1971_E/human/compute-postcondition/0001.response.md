In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the variable `t`, which is described as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\). The loop head contains only the variable `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use within the loop body.

To ensure that the loop executes, the value of `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` is already described as being between 1 and \(10^4\), it inherently satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` or any other variable outside of the loop head since they are not part of the loop's control mechanism. The loop will execute as long as `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**

Since no further adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute, the state remains as described, with the only relevant variable being `t`.
