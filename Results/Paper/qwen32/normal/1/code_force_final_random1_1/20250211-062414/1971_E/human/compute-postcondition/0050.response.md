Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input where `q` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input; `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input; `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `bd` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `b`; `i` is 1; `v` is a list containing the elements `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`; `l` is 1; `m` is 0; `ql` is an input integer; `s` is the index found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program does nothing further regarding the if-else block.**
