To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Input Values:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `n`, `k`, `q`: Integers where `q` > 0.
   - `a`: A list starting with 0 followed by `n` integers read from the input.
   - `b`: A list starting with 0 followed by `n` integers read from the input.
   
2. **Derived Lists:**
   - `ad`: Differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
   - `bd`: Differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
   
3. **Other Variables:**
   - `i`: Set to 1.
   - `v`: A list containing the ratios of corresponding elements of `ad` and `bd` starting from index 1.
   - `l`: Set to 1.
   - `m`: Set to 0.
   - `ql`: An input integer.
   - `s`: The index found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, which is the position where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order.

### Key Focus:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(b[s], end=' ')
```

This statement prints the element at index `s` of the list `b`.

### Determining the Output:
- **Index `s`:** This is determined by `bisect_left(a, ql)`. It means `s` is the smallest index in `a` such that `a[s] >= ql`.
- **Element `b[s]`:** Since `s` is the index found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, the element `b[s]` is the corresponding element in the list `b` at the same index `s`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the element at the index `s` of the list `b`, where `s` is the position found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.

Given the information provided, the precise output cannot be computed without specific values for `a`, `b`, and `ql`. However, based on the logic described, the output will be the element of `b` at the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`.

Thus, the output is:
Output: **b[s] (where s is the index found by bisect_left(a, ql))**
