To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant computations step-by-step:

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
2. `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input, with `q > 0`.
3. `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input.
4. `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input.
5. `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
6. `bd` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
7. `i` is initialized to 1.
8. `v` is a list containing the elements `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`.
9. `l` is initialized to 1.
10. `ql` is initially set to `q`.
11. `s` is the index found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.
12. `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
13. `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

### Calculation of `m`:
- `s` is determined by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, which finds the position in `a` where `ql` would fit in a sorted order.
- `m` is then computed as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

### Final Print Statement:
- The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement converts `m` to an integer and prints it, followed by a space.

### Explanation of Variables:
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers starting with 0.
- `ad` and `bd` are lists of differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, respectively.
- `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` fits.
- `m` is a computed value based on the elements of `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `ql`.

### Output:
Given the above steps, the output of the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will be the integer part of `m`, which is calculated based on the specific values of `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `ql`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `ql` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the integer part of `m`.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
