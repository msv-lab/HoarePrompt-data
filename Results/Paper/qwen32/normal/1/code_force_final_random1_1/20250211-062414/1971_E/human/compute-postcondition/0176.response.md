To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant computations step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t > 0`: A positive integer, but its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement.
   - `n`, `k`, `q` are integers read from input, with `q > 0`.
   - `a` is a list with at least two elements.
   - `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by integers read from input.
   - `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with `0`.
   - `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, starting with `0`.
   - `i` is initialized to `1`.
   - `v` is a list of ratios `ad[j] / bd[j]` for `j` from `1` to `len(a) - 1`, starting with `0`.
   - `l` is set to `q - 1`.
   - `m` is updated based on the formula `m = m + b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.
   - `ql` is a new integer read from input, then subtracted by `a[s - 1]`.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order.
   - If `a[s] == ql`, a certain condition is met, otherwise, no further changes occur.

2. **Key Variables for Print Statement:**
   - `m`: This variable is the primary focus of the print statement. It is updated based on the formula involving `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`.

### Calculation of `m`

Given the formula:
\[ m = m + b[s - 1] + \left(\frac{bd[s] \cdot ql}{ad[s]}\right) \]

- `b[s - 1]`: The element in list `b` at index `s - 1`.
- `bd[s]`: The element in list `bd` at index `s`.
- `ql`: A newly read integer minus `a[s - 1]`.
- `ad[s]`: The element in list `ad` at index `s`.

### Determining the Output

The value of `m` depends on the specific values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`. Since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output

The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m` followed by a space.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as m + b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s]))**
