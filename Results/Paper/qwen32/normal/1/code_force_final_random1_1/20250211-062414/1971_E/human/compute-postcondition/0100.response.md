Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the new integers read from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the new integers read from the input, `ad` is [0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]], `bd` is [0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]], `i` is 1, `v` is [0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]], `l` is `q`, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is undefined, `q` must be greater than 0**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ql` is now set to an integer input from the user. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
