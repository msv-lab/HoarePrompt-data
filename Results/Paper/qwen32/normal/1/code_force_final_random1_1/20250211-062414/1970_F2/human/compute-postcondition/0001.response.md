The given code attempts to assign the values of `b` to `dx` and `dy`. However, since `b` is an integer and not a sequence (like a tuple or list), this assignment will result in a `TypeError`. Given the task constraints, we'll assume the intention was to assign `b` to both `dx` and `dy`, which is a common misunderstanding when dealing with single values.

Thus, `dx` and `dy` will both take the value of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer representing the number of rows (N) in the field such that 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd, `b` is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd, `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is equal to `b`, `dx` is equal to `b`, `dy` is equal to `b`.**
