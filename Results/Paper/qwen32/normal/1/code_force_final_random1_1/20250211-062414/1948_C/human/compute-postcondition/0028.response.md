To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to but not including `n` with a step of 2.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, and `a` and `b` are strings input by the user.
- The loop breaks if `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to `<`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to `<`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume that the loop did not break during the previous iteration. Therefore, the conditions for breaking the loop were not met, and we need to update `i` accordingly.

### Step-by-step Adjustment:
1. **Adjust `i`:** Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration, we need to add 2 to the current value of `i`.
2. **Check `n`:** The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Since `i` is incremented by 2, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` is still less than `n`.

### Example Calculation:
If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3 (1 + 2).

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, `i` is 3**

This state assumes that the loop did not break during the previous iteration and that `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` had a different value at the end of the previous iteration, you would simply add 2 to that value to get the new `i` for the start of the next iteration, ensuring it remains less than `n`.

If `i` was already at a value such that `i + 2` would be equal to or greater than `n`, the loop would not execute another iteration, and the state would reflect that the loop has ended. However, based on the provided information, we assume the loop continues, and thus `i` is incremented by 2.
