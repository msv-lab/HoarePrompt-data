The code assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `a`. This means `a` will hold the value entered by the user as a string. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is still an input integer.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string input by the user.**
