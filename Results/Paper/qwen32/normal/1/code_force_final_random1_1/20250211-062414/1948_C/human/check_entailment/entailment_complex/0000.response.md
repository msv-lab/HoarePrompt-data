### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem requirements to determine if the code correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to determine if a robot can navigate from the starting point (1, 1) to the target point (2, n) in a 2xN grid, following specific movement rules:
1. The robot can move left, right, down, or up.
2. After moving, it must follow the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands on.

The provided code attempts to solve this problem by checking certain conditions related to the arrows in the grid. However, the logic in the code seems flawed because it only checks for specific patterns of arrows at every other column (i.e., columns 1, 3, 5, etc.) and does not fully simulate the robot's movements according to the problem rules.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of why the code might be incorrect:

- The code iterates through the columns in steps of 2 (i.e., `for i in range(1, n, 2)`).
- Inside the loop, it checks if there are two '<' arrows in consecutive columns (either in the same row or across different rows) and breaks if such a pattern is found, printing 'No'.
- If no such pattern is found, it prints 'Yes'.

However, this approach does not account for:
- The possibility of the robot moving up or down between rows.
- The requirement to reach the exact target cell (2, n).
- Other potential configurations of arrows that could allow the robot to reach the target.

A correct solution would need to simulate the robot's movements step-by-step, considering all possible moves and ensuring that the robot can indeed reach the target cell (2, n).

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
