The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` with a step of 2. This means `i` starts at 1 and increases by 2 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value that satisfied the loop condition. Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, to proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be the next odd number after its current value.

Given that the loop runs with `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, if `i` was 1 in the first iteration, it would be 3 in the second iteration, then 5, and so on.

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 2`.

Since the loop condition is `i in range(1, n, 2)`, `i` must be less than `n` and odd. Therefore, the next value of `i` must also satisfy this condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a string of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'; `b` is a string; `i` is the next odd number after its current value, ensuring `i` is still less than `n`.** 

To be more specific, if `i` was 1 at the end of the first iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3. If `i` was 3, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 5, and so on.

Let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. The state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a string of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'; `b` is a string; `i` is `x + 2`, where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `i` is still less than `n`.**

For concreteness, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a string of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'; `b` is a string; `i` is 5.**
