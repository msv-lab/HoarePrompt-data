### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program's logic focuses on checking specific conditions related to '<' characters in both rows but does not fully simulate the robot's movement according to the problem's rules. Specifically, it checks if there are any configurations where two '<' characters appear consecutively in the same column or adjacent columns across the two rows, which would prevent the robot from moving forward. However, this is not a comprehensive check for whether the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

2. **Movement Simulation**: The robot can move left, right, up, or down, and then follow the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands on. The program does not simulate this sequence of movements. It only checks for a specific pattern of '<' characters, which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target.

3. **Test Cases**: Let's consider the first test case from the example:
   ```
   4
   >><<
   >>><
   ```
   The program will check the condition for `i=1` and `i=3`. For `i=1`, `a[1]` is '>' and `b[2]` is '>', so no condition is met. For `i=3`, `a[3]` is '<' and `b[4]` is '>', so again no condition is met. Therefore, it will print "YES", which is correct for this case. However, the program's logic is not robust enough to handle all scenarios correctly.

4. **Missing Conditions**: The program does not account for scenarios where the robot might need to move up or down to switch rows and follow the arrows correctly. It only checks for '<' characters and their immediate surroundings, which is not sufficient.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and does not handle all possible scenarios as required by the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
