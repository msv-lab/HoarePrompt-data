Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function returns "YES" if it is possible to pair each '<' in the first string with a '>' in the second string such that each pair is aligned vertically and no two pairs overlap; otherwise, it returns "NO".**
