Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a string of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'.
- `b` is a string.
- `i` is 7.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`) mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
