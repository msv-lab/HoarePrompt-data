The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'No'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they do not affect the execution of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
