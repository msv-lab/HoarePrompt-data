Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` has been decremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is greater than 1: This means `n` is at least 2.
- `a` and `b` are strings input by the user.
- Either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both `<` with `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `<`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`. The conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not reference any of these variables or conditions. The print statement is hardcoded to output `'No'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
