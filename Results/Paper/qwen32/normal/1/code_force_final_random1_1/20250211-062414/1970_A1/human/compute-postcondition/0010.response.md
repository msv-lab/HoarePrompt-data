To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The variable `n` represents the length of the string `s` and does not change throughout the iterations. The variable `i` is the loop index that increments with each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `balance_info` is a list containing one `BalanceInfo` object with `balance` as either 1 or -1, `i` as the current index, and `s[i]` as the character at position `i` in `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current index being processed. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Increment `i`:** Since `i` is the loop index, it needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next character in the string `s`.
2. **Check if the loop can continue:** The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. Given that `n` is the length of the string `s`, the loop will stop when `i` equals `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing one `BalanceInfo` object with `balance` as either 1 or -1, `i` as the current index + 1, and `s[i]` as the character at position `i+1` in `s`.**
