To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Balance Calculation**: For each character in the string, we need to calculate the balance of the prefix up to that character.
2. **Sorting Criteria**: The characters should be sorted based on their prefix balances in ascending order. If two characters have the same balance, they should be sorted based on their positions in descending order.
3. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the characters should be joined to form the final balanced shuffle sequence.

### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function seems intended to provide a comparison for sorting based on the criteria mentioned above. However, it is not used in the provided code.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function performs the required operations:
  - It calculates the balance for each prefix.
  - It stores the balance, position, and character in a list.
  - It sorts the list based on the balance and position criteria.
  - It constructs the final sequence from the sorted list.

### Code Review:
- The sorting key in `func_2` is correctly set to `(x.balance, -x.position)`, which matches the problem's sorting criteria.
- The `BalanceInfo` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code, as it is used to store balance, position, and character information.
- The final result is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted list, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors in the implementation.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
