### Reasoning:

1. **Class Definition (`BalanceInfo`)**:
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is correctly defined to store three attributes: `balance`, `position`, and `character`. These attributes represent the balance of the prefix up to a certain position, the position itself, and the character at that position, respectively.

2. **Sorting Logic (`func_1`)**:
   - The `func_1` function is designed to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects (`infoA` and `infoB`). It first compares the `balance` attribute. If they differ, it returns the difference, which will be used for sorting in ascending order of balance.
   - If the `balance` values are the same, it compares the `position` attribute in reverse order (i.e., descending order of position). This ensures that when there are ties in balance, the character that appears later in the original sequence comes first in the sorted sequence.

3. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The `func_2` function processes the input string `s` to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, where each object holds the balance, position, and character of each position in the string.
   - It calculates the balance incrementally as it iterates through the string, adding 1 for each '(' and subtracting 1 for each ')'.
   - After constructing the list of `BalanceInfo` objects, it sorts them using the `func_1` logic (via a lambda function that specifies the sorting criteria).
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the `character` attributes of the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints this string.

4. **Execution States**:
   - The program correctly computes the prefix balance for each character in the input string.
   - It sorts these balances according to the specified criteria.
   - It constructs the final shuffled string from the sorted list of characters.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` aligns perfectly with the requirements to perform the balanced shuffle operation as described.

### Conclusion:

The provided Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation for a balanced parentheses sequence.

**Correctness: True**
