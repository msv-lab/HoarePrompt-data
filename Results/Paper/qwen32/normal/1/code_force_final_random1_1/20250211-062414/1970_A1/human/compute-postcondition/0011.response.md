The code appends a new `BalanceInfo` object to the `balance_info` list. The new `BalanceInfo` object contains the current `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`. 

Since the initial state specifies that `balance_info` is a list containing one `BalanceInfo` object, after the append operation, `balance_info` will contain two `BalanceInfo` objects.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects, the first with the initial `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`, and the second with the current `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`.**
