The given Python code snippet decrements the `balance` variable by 1. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `balance_info`) remain unchanged unless their values depend on `balance`. Since the problem specifies the exact structure of `balance_info` and mentions that it contains `BalanceInfo` objects with specific attributes, we need to consider how the decrement of `balance` affects these objects.

Given:
- `s` is a string of balanced parentheses.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `balance_info` is a list of three `BalanceInfo` objects:
  - The first object has the initial `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`.
  - The second object has the current `balance`, `i + 1`, and `s[i + 1]`.
  - The third object has the current `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`.

After executing `balance -= 1`, the `balance` in the second and third `BalanceInfo` objects will be updated to reflect the new `balance` value.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing three `BalanceInfo` objects, the first with the initial `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`, the second with the current `balance - 1`, `i + 1`, and `s[i + 1]`, and the third with the current `balance - 1`, `i`, and `s[i]`.**
