The code snippet increments the `balance` variable by 1. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `balance_info`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects, the first with the initial `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`, and the second with the current `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`; `balance` is increased by 1.**
