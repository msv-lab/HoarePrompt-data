Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects, the first with the initial `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`, and the second with the current `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is '(', then `balance` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is ')', then `balance` is decreased by 1.**
