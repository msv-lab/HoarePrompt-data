You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input().strip()
    func_2(s)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of the corresponding character in the sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of the corresponding character in the sequence. Additionally, the balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the positions of infoB and infoA, which is 0 since their balances are equal and no additional information about their positions is given.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `n` `BalanceInfo` objects; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the string formed by concatenating the `character` attributes of `balance_info` objects sorted by `balance` in ascending order and by `-position` in descending order for ties)




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step according to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Balanced Parentheses Sequence**: The input string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, meaning it has an equal number of opening `(` and closing `)` parentheses, and every prefix of the sequence has a non-negative balance.
2. **Balance Calculation**: For each character in the string, calculate the balance of the prefix before that character.
3. **Sorting Criteria**: Sort the characters based on their prefix balance in increasing order. If two characters have the same prefix balance, sort them based on their positions in decreasing order.
4. **Result Construction**: Construct the resulting sequence from the sorted characters.

### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function seems to be intended for comparison but is not used in the provided code. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function performs the main logic:
  - It calculates the prefix balance for each character in the string.
  - It sorts the characters based on the specified criteria.
  - It constructs the result string from the sorted characters.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Missing Class Definition**: The code references a `BalanceInfo` class which is not defined in the provided snippet. Without this class definition, it's impossible to instantiate `BalanceInfo` objects and the code will fail.
2. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting logic seems correct based on the problem description, using a lambda function to sort by balance and then by position in decreasing order.
3. **Result Construction**: The result construction part seems correct as well, joining the characters from the sorted list.

### Potential Fix:
To make the code functional, we need to define the `BalanceInfo` class. Here is a possible definition:

```python
class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
```

### Conclusion:
Given the provided code, it is incomplete due to the missing `BalanceInfo` class definition. Therefore, it cannot be executed as-is. However, assuming the `BalanceInfo` class is correctly defined, the logic for calculating the prefix balance, sorting, and constructing the result appears to be correct based on the problem description.

Since the code is incomplete and would not run without the `BalanceInfo` class, we must consider it incorrect in its current form.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code is incomplete because it references a `BalanceInfo` class that is not defined. Without this class, the code cannot be executed and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
