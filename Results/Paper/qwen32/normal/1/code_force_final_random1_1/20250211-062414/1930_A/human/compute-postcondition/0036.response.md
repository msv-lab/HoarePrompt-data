Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and the loop has executed exactly t times. For each of the t test cases, n is an input integer, l is a sorted list of integers derived from the corresponding input, and score is the sum of elements at even indices from 0 to 2*(n-1) in the list l. The final output consists of t scores, one per line.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` test cases, where for each test case, it calculates the score as the sum of elements at even indices of a sorted list of `2n` integers. The result is `t` scores, each printed on a new line.
