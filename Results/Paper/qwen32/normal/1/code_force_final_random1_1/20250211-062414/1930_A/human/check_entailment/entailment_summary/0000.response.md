### Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available numbers together. This ensures that we are maximizing the contribution of smaller numbers to the score, which are otherwise lost if paired with larger numbers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it sorts the list of integers. Sorting helps in easily picking the smallest available numbers.
3. **Score Calculation**: After sorting, the program iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, ...). These elements represent the minimum of each pair when the list is divided into pairs of consecutive elements.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

By sorting the list and summing up the elements at even indices, the program effectively pairs the smallest numbers together, thereby maximizing the score as per the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

**Correctness: True**
