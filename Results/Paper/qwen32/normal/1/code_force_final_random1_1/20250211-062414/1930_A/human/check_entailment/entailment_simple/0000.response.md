### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest available numbers in each pair, as the score is incremented by the minimum of the two chosen numbers. Sorting the list of numbers ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which maximizes the total score.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Score Calculation**: The program iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from index 0. This means it picks the smallest number in each pair of numbers, as the list is sorted.
4. **Output**: The score for each test case is printed.

By sorting the list and summing up the elements at even indices, the program effectively pairs the smallest numbers together, ensuring the maximum possible score.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the correctness of the program using the example test cases provided:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `1`, `2 3`
   - Sorted List: `[2, 3]`
   - Score: `2` (choosing `2` and `3`, score is `min(2, 3) = 2`)
   - Output: `2`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `2`, `1 1 2 1`
   - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
   - Score: `1 + 1 = 2` (choosing `1` and `1` first, then `1` and `2`, score is `min(1, 1) + min(1, 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`)
   - Output: `2`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Score: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (choosing `1` and `1` three times, score is `min(1, 1) + min(1, 1) + min(1, 1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`)
   - Output: `3`

All the outputs match the expected results, confirming that the program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score by always pairing the smallest numbers together. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

**Correctness: True**
