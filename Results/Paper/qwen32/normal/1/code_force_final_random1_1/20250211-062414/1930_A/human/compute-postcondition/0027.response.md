The given code snippet resets the value of `score` to 0. This means that regardless of its previous value (which was the sum of elements at even indices in the list `l`), `score` is now set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is 0.**
