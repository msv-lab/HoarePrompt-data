### Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the smaller of the two to our score. The optimal strategy involves sorting the list of integers and then summing up the elements at even indices. This works because, after sorting, the smallest elements are paired together, ensuring that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Sorting**: By sorting the list of integers, we ensure that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list. This allows us to always pick the smallest possible number when forming pairs.

2. **Pairing and Summing**: After sorting, we iterate through the list, taking every second element starting from index 0. These elements represent the minimum values of each pair (since the list is sorted, the element at index `i` is always less than or equal to the element at index `i+1`).

3. **Summing Even Indices**: By summing the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2), we effectively sum the minimum values of each pair, which maximizes the score.

The annotated program correctly implements this strategy. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading `n` and the list of `2n` integers, sorts the list, and then sums the elements at even indices. Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score, and the annotated states accurately describe the behavior of the program. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
