The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the value of `l[i]` to the current value of `score`. Given that `i` is the next even number and `score` is initially `l[i]`, after executing the code, `score` will be `l[i] + l[i]`, which simplifies to `2 * l[i]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is the next even number, `score` is `2 * l[i]`**.

This means that `score` has been doubled because it now includes two instances of `l[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
