The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 2 (since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time). The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

Given that `i` was 2 units smaller at the start of the previous iteration, we need to increase `i` by 2 to get the correct state at the start of the next iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the current iteration, `i` would have been `i_end - 2`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 2`.

The variable `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

Therefore, if `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 2`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i_end` is the value of `i` right before the increment. If `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 2`.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i_end`, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is `l[i]`, `i` is `i_end + 2` where `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

To provide a concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

So, assuming `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is `l[4]`, `i` is 4**

But in general form without specific `i_end`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is `l[i]`, `i` is `i_end + 2`**
