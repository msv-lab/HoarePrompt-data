To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next even number, and `score` is `2 * l[i]`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current even number being processed.
2. **Loop Progression**: In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 2 (as per the `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`).
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2 from its current value.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `i + 2`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Given that `i` is currently the next even number, adding 2 to it will give us the next even number in the sequence.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is the next even number + 2, `score` is `2 * l[i + 2]`**

However, since `score` is recalculated within the loop based on the new `i`, we should reflect only the changes to `i` and `n` in the state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is the next even number + 2**
