To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `k` is initially `k - n + 1`, but its value is recalculated as `k - n + 1` if `k` is not 0.
- `l` is the result of `func_3(1, l)`.
- `c` is 2.
- The function returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`.

Since the function always executes `return func_2(c, k, l)`, we need to consider the values of `c`, `k`, and `l`:

- `c` is directly given as 2.
- `k` is recalculated as `k - n + 1` unless it is 0. Since the problem does not specify the initial value of `k`, we assume it is recalculated as `k - n + 1` and used in the return statement.
- `l` is the result of `func_3(1, l)`, which means `l` is whatever `func_3` returns when called with `1` and the initial `l`.

Therefore, the output of the function is determined by `func_2(2, k - n + 1, func_3(1, l))`.

Output State: **The program returns the result of `func_2(2, k - n + 1, func_3(1, l))`**.
