To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n - 4`.
- `k` is `k - n + 3`. However, there's no initial value for `k` provided, so this calculation doesn't affect our final output.
- `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`. Since we don't have any information about `func_3` or the initial value of `l`, we'll consider `l` as the result of this function call.
- `c` is 3. This variable is not used in the code snippet provided.

Code Snippet:
```python
return l
```

Given that the code returns `l`, and `l` is defined as the result of `func_3(2, l)`, we can conclude that the program returns whatever `func_3(2, l)` computes. Since we don't have details about `func_3`, we can only say that the program returns the result of this function call.

Output State: **The program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`**.
