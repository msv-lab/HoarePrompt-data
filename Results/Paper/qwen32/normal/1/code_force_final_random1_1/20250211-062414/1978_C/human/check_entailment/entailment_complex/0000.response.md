### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem as per the provided annotations and descriptions.

#### Function `func_4`:
- This function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
- It checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value must be even.
- It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` based on whether `n` is odd or even.
- If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`.
- Otherwise, it returns the tuple `(n, k)`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
- It starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- It iterates from `n` down to `1` in steps of `-2`, adjusting the permutation and reducing `k` accordingly.
- If `k` becomes `0` during the iteration, it returns the current permutation.
- If `k` is less than `i - 1` at some point, it calls `func_2` to make the necessary adjustments and returns the result.
- If the loop completes without returning, it continues with further adjustments using `func_3`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function swaps two elements in the permutation to adjust the Manhattan value.
- It swaps the elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function swaps the `c`-th element with the `c`-th last element in the list `l`.

#### Function `func_5`:
- This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l`.

#### Function `func_6`:
- This function orchestrates the process.
- It calls `func_4` to validate the input.
- If `n` is `0`, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_5` to print it.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.
- It ensures that the Manhattan value `k` is even and within the feasible range.
- The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` work together to construct the permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
- The program outputs "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid permutation exists, otherwise it outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists.

**Correctness: True**
