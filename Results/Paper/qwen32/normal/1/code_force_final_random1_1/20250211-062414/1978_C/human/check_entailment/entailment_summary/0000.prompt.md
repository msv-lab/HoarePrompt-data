Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    112 777
    
    5 12

    Yes
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7

    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    func_6()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        k = k - i + 1
        l = func_3(c, l)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` generates a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` based on the given Manhattan value `k`. Depending on the value of `k`, it either returns a simple list of integers from 1 to `n`, or it calls other functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) to compute and return a modified permutation.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(c, k, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[-c - k])
    (l[-c], l[-c - k]) = (y, x)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` takes three parameters: two non-negative integers `c` and `k`, and a list `l` of integers with at least `c + k + 1` elements. It swaps the elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l` and returns the modified list.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(c, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[c - 1])
    (l[c - 1], l[-c]) = (x, y)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function takes a positive integer `c` and a list `l` of integers with at least `c` elements, and returns the list `l` with the `c`-th element and the `c`-th last element swapped.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input. If `k` is not an even integer, or if `k` exceeds the maximum possible value based on `n`, the function returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns the tuple `(n, k)`.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is distinct and within the range from 1 to `n`. It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` on the same line, separated by spaces, and then prints a newline. The function returns `None`.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (n, k) = func_4()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` determines whether a permutation of length `n` with a specific Manhattan value `k` can be constructed. If `n` is zero, it prints 'NO' and does not return any value. Otherwise, it processes the inputs using other functions (`func_1` and `func_5`) and ultimately returns `None`.
