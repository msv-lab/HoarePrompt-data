To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem of finding a permutation of length `n` with a specific Manhattan value `k`, or determining that no such permutation exists.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the Manhattan value \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| = k \).
   - If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \) if `n` is even, and \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) if `n` is odd.
   - If `k` is greater than this maximum value, no such permutation exists.
   - The Manhattan value must be even because swapping two elements in the permutation changes the Manhattan value by an even amount.

3. **Analyzing the Program:**

   - **Function `func_4`:**
     - Reads input values `n` and `k`.
     - Checks if `k` is odd; if so, returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
     - Computes the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` based on whether `n` is even or odd.
     - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, returns `(0, 0)`.
     - Otherwise, returns `(n, k)` indicating a potential solution exists.

   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - Divides `k` by 2 (since the Manhattan value change due to swaps is always even).
     - Initializes a list `l` as the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - Iterates over indices in reverse order, adjusting the permutation to increase the Manhattan value.
     - Calls `func_2` or `func_3` to perform specific swaps based on the remaining `k`.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - Performs a swap between elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`.

   - **Function `func_3`:**
     - Swaps elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`.

   - **Function `func_5`:**
     - Prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l`.

   - **Function `func_6`:**
     - Calls `func_4` to check if a solution exists.
     - If no solution exists (`n == 0`), prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and prints it using `func_5`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly checks if `k` is achievable based on the maximum possible Manhattan value and whether `k` is even.
   - The logic for generating the permutation involves strategic swaps to achieve the desired Manhattan value, which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a permutation with the specified Manhattan value exists and generates such a permutation when possible.

**Correctness: True**
