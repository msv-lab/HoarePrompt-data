Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `k`, a non-negative integer. It returns a list of integers from 1 to `n` rearranged based on the value of `k`. Depending on `k`, the list can be returned in its original order, with `n` moved to a specific position, or with elements reordered in a particular pattern.**
