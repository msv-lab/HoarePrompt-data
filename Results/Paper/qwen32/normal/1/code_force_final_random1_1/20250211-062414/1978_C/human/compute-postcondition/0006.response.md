The code snippet provided calls `func_5(l)`, where `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`. This function call does not directly modify the variables `n`, `k`, or `l`; it only executes the function `func_5` with `l` as its argument. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`. `n` is not equal to 0; `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)` and `func_5(l)` has been called.**
