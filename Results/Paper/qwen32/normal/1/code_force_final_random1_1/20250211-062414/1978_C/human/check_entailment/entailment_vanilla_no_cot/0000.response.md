To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to n such that the Manhattan value equals k. If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length n is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \) (or \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) if n is odd).
   - The Manhattan value must be even because each swap operation (which is used to construct the permutation) changes the Manhattan value by an even amount.
   - The function `func_4` checks if k is even and if it is within the bounds of the maximum possible Manhattan value.

3. **Analyzing the Functions**:
   - `func_1`: This function attempts to construct the permutation by iteratively making swaps to increase the Manhattan value until it reaches k.
   - `func_2`: This function performs a specific swap to adjust the permutation when the remaining k is less than the current index difference.
   - `func_3`: This function performs another type of swap to continue adjusting the permutation.
   - `func_4`: This function reads input values and checks if a valid permutation can exist.
   - `func_5`: This function prints the permutation if found.
   - `func_6`: This function orchestrates the process by calling other functions.

4. **Testing the Program**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem statement.
   - It checks if k is even and within the permissible range before attempting to construct a permutation.
   - The logic for constructing the permutation seems to be based on swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem according to the provided description and examples.

Therefore, the response is:
Correctness: **True**
