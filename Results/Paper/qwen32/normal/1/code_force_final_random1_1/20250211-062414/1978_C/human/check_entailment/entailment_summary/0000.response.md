### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that it meets the problem requirements for all valid inputs. Let's break down the logic and verify if the functions work as intended.

#### Key Points:
1. **Manhattan Value Calculation**: The Manhattan value of a permutation \( p \) is defined as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).
2. **Constraints**: 
   - \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \)
   - \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^{12} \)
3. **Objective**: For each test case, find a permutation of length \( n \) with a Manhattan value of \( k \), or determine that no such permutation exists.

#### Function Analysis:
1. **func_4**: This function reads the input values \( n \) and \( k \). It checks if \( k \) is even and if it is within the feasible range for the given \( n \). If not, it returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.
2. **func_1**: This function generates a permutation based on the given \( n \) and \( k \). It handles the case when \( k \) is zero by returning the identity permutation. For non-zero \( k \), it iteratively modifies the permutation by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
3. **func_2**: This function performs a swap operation between two specific elements in the list to adjust the permutation.
4. **func_3**: This function swaps the \( c \)-th element with the \( c \)-th last element in the list.
5. **func_5**: This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid permutation is found.
6. **func_6**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to validate inputs, `func_1` to generate the permutation, and `func_5` to print the result.

#### Verification:
- **Even \( k \)**: The problem specifies that the Manhattan value must be even. `func_4` correctly checks this condition.
- **Feasibility Check**: `func_4` ensures that \( k \) does not exceed the maximum possible Manhattan value for a given \( n \).
- **Permutation Generation**: `func_1` uses a strategy to incrementally build a permutation that achieves the desired Manhattan value. It leverages `func_2` and `func_3` to make precise adjustments.
- **Output Handling**: `func_5` correctly formats the output as required.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all specified conditions and constraints correctly. The functions work together to generate a valid permutation or determine that no such permutation exists.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided code and the explanation of the functions, the program correctly solves the problem for all valid inputs.

**Correctness: True**
