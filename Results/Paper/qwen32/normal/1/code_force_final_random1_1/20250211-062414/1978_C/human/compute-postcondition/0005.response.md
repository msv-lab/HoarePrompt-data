The code assigns the result of the function call `func_1(n, k)` to the variable `l`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the outputs from `func_4()` and are used as inputs to `func_1()`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `l` and retains the original conditions for `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`. `n` is not equal to 0; `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`.**
