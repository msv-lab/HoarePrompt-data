To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the effect of the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `results` is an empty list.

Code Snippet:
```python
winner = func_1(a, b)
```

This line of code calls a function named `func_1` with `a` and `b` as arguments and assigns the return value to the variable `winner`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `winner`. However, we know that `winner` will hold whatever value `func_1(a, b)` returns.

The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged, and `results` is still an empty list.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.**
