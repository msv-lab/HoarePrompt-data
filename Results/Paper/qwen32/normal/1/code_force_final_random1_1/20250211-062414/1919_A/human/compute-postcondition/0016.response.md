Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input during the last iteration.
- `t` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case.
- `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is attempting to print a variable named `result`.
- However, there is no variable named `result` mentioned in the initial state. There is a variable named `results`, which is a list, but it is not the same as `result`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, there seems to be a typo in the print statement. It should likely be `results` instead of `result`. Since the variable `result` does not exist based on the initial state, we cannot determine what will be printed.

However, if we assume the intention was to print the `results` list, the output would be the list of results from each test case.

### Final Output:
Since the variable `result` does not exist, the code will raise a `NameError`. But if we assume the intention was to print `results`, the output would be:

Output: **results (where results is a list containing t elements, each being the return value of func_1(a, b) for each corresponding test case)**

But strictly adhering to the given precondition and the actual print statement, the correct output considering the error would be:

Output: **NameError: name 'result' is not defined**
