You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Output

    Bob
    Alice

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the solution provided.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who start with `a` and `b` coins respectively. They take turns, and in each turn, a player can either swap their wallet with the opponent's or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the game essentially reduces to a Nim game with a single pile of coins, and the player who starts with an odd number of coins can always force a win.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on the sum of `a` and `b`.
2. `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by reading input, calling `func_1`, and printing the results.

Let's examine `func_1`:
- It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it returns "Bob".
- If the sum is odd, it returns "Alice".

This logic aligns perfectly with our analysis of the problem. The sum of the coins determines the winner based on the parity.

### Verification

We need to verify if there are any edge cases or scenarios that the program might not handle correctly. Given the simplicity of the logic and the fact that the sum of two integers can only be either even or odd, there do not seem to be any edge cases that would cause the program to fail.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. It handles all possible cases of `a` and `b` within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. There are no edge cases or scenarios that the program fails to handle correctly.
