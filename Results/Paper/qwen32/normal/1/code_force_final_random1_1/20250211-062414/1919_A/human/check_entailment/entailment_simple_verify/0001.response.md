### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their current wallet. They can also choose to swap wallets before removing a coin. The player who cannot make a move loses. The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).

- **Even Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always lose if both play optimally. This is because Alice starts the game, and each move reduces the total number of coins by one, alternating between odd and even. When the total number of coins reaches 1, it will be Alice's turn, and she will lose since she cannot remove the last coin without leaving Bob with no coins to remove.
  
- **Odd Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally. After Alice's first move, the total number of coins becomes even, putting Bob in the same position as Alice was initially. Therefore, Bob will eventually be left with no coins, and Alice wins.

#### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic:
- It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
- If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

The function `func_2` handles the input/output operations correctly:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
- It calls `func_1` to determine the winner and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints all the results.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes the input and applies the logic in `func_1` to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The states described in the annotations match the expected behavior of the program.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program correctly determines the winner by checking the parity of the total number of coins, which aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. The annotations support this conclusion.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
