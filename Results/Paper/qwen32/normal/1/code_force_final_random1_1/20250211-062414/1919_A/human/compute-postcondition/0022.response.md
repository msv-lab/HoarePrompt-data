Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, with the constraints 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9. The function does not explicitly take `a` and `b` as arguments but is expected to utilize them. The function returns the total number of coins combined from both Alice's and Bob's wallets.**
