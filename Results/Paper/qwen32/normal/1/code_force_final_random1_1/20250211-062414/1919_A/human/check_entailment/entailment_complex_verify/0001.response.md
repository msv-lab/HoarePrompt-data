### Reasoning

The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
- The game revolves around the parity (odd/even) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
- If `a + b` is even, Bob wins.
- If `a + b` is odd, Alice wins.

#### Program Analysis Recap:
- `func_1(a, b)`:
  - Checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
  - Returns `'Bob'` if true (even sum).
  - Returns `'Alice'` if false (odd sum).
- `func_2()`:
  - Reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, reads `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result.
  - Prints the results for all test cases.

#### Annotations Recap:
- The annotations confirm that `func_1` correctly evaluates the sum of `a` and `b` and returns the appropriate winner based on the parity.
- The state of variables is correctly tracked throughout the execution of `func_2`.

#### Edge Cases Considered:
- The constraints `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` ensure that the sum `a + b` will always be within a manageable range for integer operations.
- The program correctly handles the minimum and maximum possible values for `a` and `b`.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. There are no discrepancies between the expected behavior and the actual behavior as described by the annotations.

### Final Evaluation
