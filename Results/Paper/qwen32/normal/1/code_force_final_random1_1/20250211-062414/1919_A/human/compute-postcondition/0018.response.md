To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input during the last iteration.
- `t` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, representing the number of test cases.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case.
- `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case.
- `result` is the next element in the `results` list.

Given this information, the `result` variable is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the current test case being processed. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` for the current test case are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`.

However, we can describe `result` precisely in terms of the function `func_1` and the inputs `a` and `b` for the current test case.

Therefore, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the current test case.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the current test case)**
