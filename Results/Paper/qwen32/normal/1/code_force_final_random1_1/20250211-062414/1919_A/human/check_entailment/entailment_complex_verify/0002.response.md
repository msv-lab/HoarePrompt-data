Let's analyze the problem and the provided program in detail to verify the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis:
The game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins between Alice and Bob. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

- **If the total number of coins (a + b) is even**, Alice will always lose if both play optimally. This is because every time Alice makes a move, she will reduce the total number of coins by 1, making it odd. Bob will then make a move, reducing it back to even. Eventually, when there is only 1 coin left, it will be Alice's turn to take it, leaving Bob with no coins and thus Bob wins.
  
- **If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd**, Alice will always win if both play optimally. This is because after Alice's first move, the total number of coins becomes even, putting Bob in the same position as Alice was in the previous scenario. Thus, Bob will eventually be left with no coins, and Alice wins.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic:
- It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
- If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

The function `func_2` handles the input/output operations correctly:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
- It calls `func_1` to determine the winner and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints all the results.

### Annotations:
The annotations confirm the behavior of the functions:
- In `func_1`, the annotations correctly describe the conditions and the return values based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
- In `func_2`, the annotations correctly describe the states of variables and the flow of the program.

### Verification Against Example Cases:
Let's verify the program against the example cases provided in the problem description:

1. **Test Case: 1 1**
   - Total coins: 2 (even)
   - Expected: Bob
   - Program Output: Bob

2. **Test Case: 1 4**
   - Total coins: 5 (odd)
   - Expected: Alice
   - Program Output: Alice

3. **Test Case: 5 3**
   - Total coins: 8 (even)
   - Expected: Bob
   - Program Output: Bob

4. **Test Case: 4 5**
   - Total coins: 9 (odd)
   - Expected: Alice
   - Program Output: Alice

5. **Test Case: 11 9**
   - Total coins: 20 (even)
   - Expected: Bob
   - Program Output: Bob

6. **Test Case: 83 91**
   - Total coins: 174 (even)
   - Expected: Bob
   - Program Output: Bob

7. **Test Case: 1032 9307**
   - Total coins: 10339 (odd)
   - Expected: Alice
   - Program Output: Alice

8. **Test Case: 839204 7281**
   - Total coins: 846485 (odd)
   - Expected: Alice
   - Program Output: Alice

9. **Test Case: 1000000000 1000000000**
   - Total coins: 2000000000 (even)
   - Expected: Bob
   - Program Output: Bob

10. **Test Case: 53110 2024**
    - Total coins: 55134 (even)
    - Expected: Bob
    - Program Output: Bob

All the test cases match the expected outcomes, confirming that the program works correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, which aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
