### Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to verify whether the logic implemented in the functions aligns with the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Game Analysis:**
   - The game revolves around the total number of coins `(a + b)`.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the sum of coins.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns `'Bob'`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `'Alice'`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`a` and `b`).
   - It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner for each test case.
   - It stores the result in a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

4. **Verification Against Examples:**
   - Let's verify the first few examples provided in the problem statement.
     - For `a = 1` and `b = 1`, `a + b = 2` (even), so `func_1(1, 1)` should return `'Bob'`. This matches the expected output.
     - For `a = 1` and `b = 4`, `a + b = 5` (odd), so `func_1(1, 4)` should return `'Alice'`. This matches the expected output.
     - For `a = 5` and `b = 3`, `a + b = 8` (even), so `func_1(5, 3)` should return `'Bob'`. This matches the expected output.
     - For `a = 4` and `b = 5`, `a + b = 9` (odd), so `func_1(4, 5)` should return `'Alice'`. This matches the expected output.
   - All the examples match the expected outcomes based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in both functions correctly determines the winner based on the total number of coins, and the program handles multiple test cases as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
