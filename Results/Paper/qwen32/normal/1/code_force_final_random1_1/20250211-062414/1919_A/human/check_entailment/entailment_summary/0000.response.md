### Reasoning:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify that the logic implemented in the functions aligns with the rules of the game and the expected outcomes.

The key insight in this game is that the player who starts with an odd total number of coins (across both wallets) will always win if both players play optimally. This is because the game essentially reduces to a Nim game with one pile where the pile size is the sum of coins in both wallets. In Nim, the player who faces a position with an even number of coins in total will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Here's a breakdown of the functions:

- **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly determines the winner based on whether the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd or even. If the total is even, it returns 'Bob', and if the total is odd, it returns 'Alice'. This aligns with the optimal strategy derived from the game theory analysis.

- **Function `func_2()`**: This function handles the input/output operations. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the results. Finally, it prints out the results for each test case. This part of the code is correctly structured to handle multiple test cases and produce the required output format.

Since both functions work as intended and the logic is consistent with the problem description, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
