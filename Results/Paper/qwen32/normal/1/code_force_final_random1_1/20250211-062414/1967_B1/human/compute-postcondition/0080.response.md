Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are the input integers where `m` must be greater than 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1`; `i` is 1; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `int(n / 3)`. There is no change to the variables regardless of whether `g < countmins` is true or false since there is no else part to modify the variables.**
