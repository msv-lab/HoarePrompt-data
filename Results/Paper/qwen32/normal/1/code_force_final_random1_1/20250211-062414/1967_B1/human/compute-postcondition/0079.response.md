The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop or switch block. Since there is no loop or switch block in the provided context, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are the input integers where `m` must be greater than 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1`; `i` is 1; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `int(n / 3)`**
