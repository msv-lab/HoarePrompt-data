The `break` statement does not affect any of the variables directly; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop or switch block. Since there is no loop or switch block shown in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no impact on the variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are the input integers where `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `i` is 1; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n // 2`. Additionally, `g` is less than `countmins`.**
