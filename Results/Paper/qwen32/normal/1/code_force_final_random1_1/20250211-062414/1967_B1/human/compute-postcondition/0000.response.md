`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not mentioned in the provided code snippet. The precondition about the constraints on `t`, `n`, and `m` still holds.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
