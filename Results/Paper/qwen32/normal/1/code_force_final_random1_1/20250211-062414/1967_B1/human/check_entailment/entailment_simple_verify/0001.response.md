### Reasoning

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem requirements and compare them with the program's implementation and annotations.

#### Problem Requirements Recap

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be written as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

Let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\). Then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[ dx + dy = k \cdot dy \cdot d \]
\[ dx + dy = k \cdot d^2 y \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot d y \]
\[ x = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot y \]

For \(x\) to be a positive integer, \(k \cdot d - 1\) must be a positive integer. Additionally, \(x\) must satisfy \(1 \leq x \leq \frac{n}{d}\) and \(1 \leq y \leq \frac{m}{d}\).

#### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program and its annotations step-by-step:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

**Annotations:**
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are read.
- `count` starts at 2 and goes up to `m`.
- `ans` is initialized to `n`.
- `countmins` is `count - 1`.
- `g` is calculated as `n // count`.
- If `g < countmins`, the loop breaks.
- `g` is updated to `g - countmins`.
- `ans` is incremented by `int(g / count) + 1`.
- Finally, `ans` is printed.

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The initial value of `ans` is set to `n`, which is incorrect. It should start from 0 because we need to count all valid pairs, including those where `b > 1`.
2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs:** The logic used to count valid pairs is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the gcd condition. Specifically, it does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Handling of `b = 1`:** The program does not handle the case when `b = 1` properly. When `b = 1`, any \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) is valid, so there should be `n` valid pairs for `b = 1`.

#### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The initialization of `ans` to `n` and the flawed logic for counting valid pairs are significant issues.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
