Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if `n` is less than `m`, it returns "n is less than m"; if `n` is greater than `m`, it returns "n is greater than m"; and if `n` is equal to `m`, it returns "n is equal to m".**
