Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are the input integers where `m` must be greater than 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1`; `i` is 1; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `int(n / 3) - 2`.**

Natural Language: The value of `g` is updated to be `int(n / 3) - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
