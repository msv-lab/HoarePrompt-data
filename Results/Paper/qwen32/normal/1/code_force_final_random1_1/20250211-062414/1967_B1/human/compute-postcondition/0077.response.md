Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are the input integers where `m` must be greater than 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1`; `i` is 1; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n // 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `countmins` is updated to `int(count - 1)`, which means `countmins` is now `2` since `count` was `3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
