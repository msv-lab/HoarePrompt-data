In this task, the initial state describes how the variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` remains unchanged. However, the `print` statement does not involve these variables `i` and `n` directly. Instead, it simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **NO**
