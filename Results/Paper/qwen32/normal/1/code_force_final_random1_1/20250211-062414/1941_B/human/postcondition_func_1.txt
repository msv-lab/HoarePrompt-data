The function `func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` (where `3 <= n <= len(list)`). It modifies the first `n-2` elements of the list to zero under certain conditions, then checks a condition using `func_1`. Depending on the result of `func_1`, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'. The final state of the list is that the first `n-2` elements are zero, and the last two elements remain unchanged.
