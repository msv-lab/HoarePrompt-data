You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    7
    
    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1
    
    5
    
    0 1 3 3 1
    
    6
    
    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the parity and values of the first two and last two elements of the list `a`. It prints 'YES' if the conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The current implementation only checks if the first two or last two elements satisfy certain conditions, which is insufficient to solve the problem.

Here's a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
For the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, it is indeed possible to make all elements zero using the described operations. Here's how:

1. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 1, 0, 1]`
2. Apply the operation at `i=3` again: `[1, 1, -1, 1, 1]` (This step is invalid as we cannot have negative numbers, so let's try another approach)
3. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`
4. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[0, 0, -1, 0, 2]` (Again, invalid)
5. Instead, let's try applying the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`
6. Finally, apply the operation at `i=3`: `[0, 0, -1, 1, 0]` (Invalid)

Let's try another valid sequence:
1. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`
2. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, -1, 2, 0, 1]` (Invalid)
3. Let's try another approach:
4. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 2, 1, 0, 0]`
5. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 1, -1, 1, 0]` (Invalid)

Another valid sequence:
1. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 1]`
2. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Thus, the array can be made zero, but the program incorrectly outputs "NO".

The program needs a more comprehensive approach to verify if the array can be transformed into zeros using the allowed operations. It should check if the array can be balanced through a series of valid operations, not just the initial and final elements.
