Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `i + 1`: This indicates that `i` is being incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact value before this operation.
- `n` is an integer read from input such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\): This tells us the range within which `n` lies, but it does not affect the print statement directly.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'NO'`. The values of `i` and `n` do not influence the output of this specific print statement because the string `'NO'` is explicitly provided.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
