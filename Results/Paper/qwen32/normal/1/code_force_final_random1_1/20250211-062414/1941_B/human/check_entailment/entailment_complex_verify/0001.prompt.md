You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

    #State: A sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the parity and values of the first two and last two elements of the list `a`. It prints 'YES' if the conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the requirements of the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem states that we need to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) and perform the following changes:
- Decrease \( a_{i-1} \) by 1.
- Decrease \( a_i \) by 2.
- Decrease \( a_{i+1} \) by 1.

The key observation here is that the operation affects three consecutive elements, and the total change in the sum of the array due to this operation is -4. Therefore, for it to be possible to make all elements zero, the sum of the array must be divisible by 4.

However, the given program does not check the sum of the array. Instead, it checks two conditions related to the parity of the first and last elements and their neighbors:
- If the first element is odd and the second element is not exactly 2 more than the first, it prints "NO".
- If the last element is odd and the second-to-last element is not exactly 2 more than the last, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Evaluation of the Given Program
The logic implemented in the program is flawed because:
1. It does not consider the sum of the array, which is a crucial factor in determining whether the array can be reduced to all zeros.
2. The conditions checked by the program do not cover all necessary cases for the feasibility of reducing the array to all zeros. For instance, the program might incorrectly return "YES" for arrays where the sum is not divisible by 4, or it might incorrectly return "NO" for arrays where the sum is divisible by 4 but does not meet the specific parity conditions.

### Conclusion
Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as per the requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
