### Reasoning:
The provided code snippet attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions related to the first and last elements of the array `b`. However, these conditions do not fully capture the requirements of the problem.

The key operation described in the problem involves modifying three consecutive elements of the array at a time. Specifically, for an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`), the operation modifies `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` as follows:
- `a[i-1] = a[i-1] - 1`
- `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
- `a[i+1] = a[i+1] - 1`

The goal is to determine if it's possible to reduce all elements of the array to zero using this operation any number of times.

The current implementation checks whether the first element `b[0]` is odd and the second element `b[1]` is not equal to `b[0] + 2`, or whether the last element `b[-1]` is odd and the second-to-last element `b[-2]` is not equal to `b[-1] + 2`. These checks are insufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the entire array can be transformed into zeros through the described operations. This typically involves ensuring that the sum of the array elements is even (since each operation reduces the total sum by 4) and that the array can be balanced through a series of operations.

Given the current implementation only checks the first and last elements, it fails to account for the necessary conditions for the entire array. Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.
