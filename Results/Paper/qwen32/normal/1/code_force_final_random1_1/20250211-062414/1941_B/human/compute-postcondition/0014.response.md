In this task, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. Since `_` does not hold any significant state that needs to be adjusted, the state of other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`) remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration to the start of the next iteration.

Given that the loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`, the only thing that changes is the implicit counter managed by the `range` function. However, since `_` is not used within the loop, its value does not affect the state of the program in terms of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration with respect to the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the first element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second element minus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second-to-last element minus 2, then the if block's postcondition holds. Otherwise, the else block's postcondition holds, which is identical to the initial state.**
