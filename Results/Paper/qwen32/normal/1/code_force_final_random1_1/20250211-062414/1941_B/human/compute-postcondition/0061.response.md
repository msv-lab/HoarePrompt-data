The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. Given the initial state, `a[i]` is specified to be 0. Therefore, `opNum` will be updated to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0 and `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is 0; `stop` is True if `a[i]` was less than 0, otherwise `stop` remains False; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` was less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
