The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `b`. This means that the variable `b` is updated to reflect the new list of integers obtained from the input.

The initial state mentioned conditions about the elements of `b` (specifically the first and last elements and their relationships with adjacent elements). However, these conditions do not affect the execution of the given code snippet itself, which only updates the value of `b`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `b` based on the input, while the other variables (`t` and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
