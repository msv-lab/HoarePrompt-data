The given code snippet modifies the element at index `i` in the list `a` by subtracting `opNum` from it. The other variables remain unchanged unless specified.

Given:
- `_` is incremented by 1 (though its exact value or usage is not clear from the snippet)
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1
- `n` is at least 3
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input
- `opNum` is `a[i]`
- `stop` remains False unless `a[i] < 0` (not checked in this snippet)

The operation performed is:
```
a[i] -= opNum
```

This means the element at index `i` in the list `a` is updated to be its current value minus `opNum`.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is now `a[i] - opNum`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `stop` remains False unless `a[i] < 0` (which is not checked in this snippet).**

In simpler terms: The element at index `i` in the list `a` has been reduced by its own value, making `a[i]` equal to 0. All other variables retain their original values.
