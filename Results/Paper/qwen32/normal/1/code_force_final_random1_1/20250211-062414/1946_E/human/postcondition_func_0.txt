The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. It computes and returns a tuple `(x, y)` that represents the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, i.e., `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. Specifically, it returns `(1, 0)` if `b` is zero, and otherwise returns coefficients such that the linear combination of `a` and `b` equals their greatest common divisor (GCD).
