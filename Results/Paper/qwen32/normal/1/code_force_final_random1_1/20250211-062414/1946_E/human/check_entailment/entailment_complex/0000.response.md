### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy specific conditions regarding their prefix and suffix maximums. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly addresses the problem:

1. **Precomputation of Factorials**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to `200002` modulo `1000000007` (denoted as `facts`). This is necessary for efficiently calculating combinations later in the program.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m1`, and `m2` (the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively).
   - It also reads the indices of the prefix maximums (`p`) and the suffix maximums (`s`).

3. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, if the first prefix maximum index is `1`, and if the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, the program outputs `0` because no valid permutation exists under these circumstances.

4. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - The program calculates the number of valid permutations by considering the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It uses a helper function `func_2` to compute modular inverses and combinations efficiently.
   - The program iterates through the suffix maximums and prefix maximums, updating the count of valid permutations by multiplying the current count by the appropriate combinations.

5. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program outputs the final count of valid permutations modulo `1000000007`.

### Analysis of Functions:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity for two integers `a` and `b`. It returns a tuple `(x, y)` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
  - This function is used to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007` in `func_2`.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - This function computes `(a * b^-1) % 1000000007`, where `b^-1` is the modular inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`.
  - It uses `func_1` to find the modular inverse and then multiplies it by `a` to get the result.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to count the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions. It handles edge cases appropriately and uses efficient techniques to compute combinations and modular inverses. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
