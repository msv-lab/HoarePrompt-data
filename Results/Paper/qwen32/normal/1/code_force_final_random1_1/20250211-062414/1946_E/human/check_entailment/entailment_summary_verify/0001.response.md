### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code is incomplete and does not address the core problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of permutations of length `n` where certain indices are prefix and suffix maximums. This involves combinatorial counting and possibly dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of valid permutations.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This is useful for performing division under modular arithmetic.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses `func_1` to compute `(a / b) % 1000000007`, which is essential for handling divisions in modular arithmetic.

3. **Missing Components**:
   - The code lacks the logic to parse the input and process each test case.
   - There is no implementation to count the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The core algorithm to solve the problem is missing.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are utility functions for modular arithmetic, which are necessary but not sufficient to solve the problem.
   - Since the main logic to count permutations is absent, the program cannot be considered correct for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incomplete and does not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
