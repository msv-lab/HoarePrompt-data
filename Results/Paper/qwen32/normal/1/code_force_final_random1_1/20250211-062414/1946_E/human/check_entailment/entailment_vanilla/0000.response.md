To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to understand what the program is supposed to do and how it does it. The problem requires us to calculate the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums, and then output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Prefix and Suffix Maximums:**
   - A prefix maximum at index `i` means that the element at index `i` is greater than all previous elements.
   - A suffix maximum at index `i` means that the element at index `i` is greater than all subsequent elements.

2. **Constraints and Input Processing:**
   - We have multiple test cases, each with a permutation length `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - We also receive two lists: one for the indices of prefix maximums and another for the indices of suffix maximums.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The position of the maximum element in the permutation is crucial because it affects both the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - If there are overlapping indices between prefix and suffix maximums, the element at these positions must be the largest in their respective segments.

4. **Algorithmic Approach:**
   - To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The problem can be reduced to counting the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements while respecting the constraints.
   - This often involves combinatorial mathematics, specifically calculating binomial coefficients and factorials.

5. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the results can be very large, we need to perform calculations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) seem to be related to modular arithmetic, possibly for computing modular inverses or other operations needed for combinatorial calculations.

6. **Analysis of Provided Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` appears to compute the extended Euclidean algorithm, which can be used to find modular inverses.
   - `func_2(a, b)` uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it by `a`.

### Evaluation of the Program:

- The provided code does not directly implement the logic for counting permutations based on the given constraints.
- The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are related to modular arithmetic but are not sufficient alone to solve the problem.
- The core logic for counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums is missing.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided code is incomplete and does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
