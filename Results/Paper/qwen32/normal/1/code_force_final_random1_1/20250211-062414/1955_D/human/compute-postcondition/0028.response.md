The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 2**
