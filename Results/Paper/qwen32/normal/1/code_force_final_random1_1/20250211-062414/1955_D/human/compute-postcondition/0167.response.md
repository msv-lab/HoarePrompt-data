The provided code snippet only reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. None of the other variables (`b_values`, `ans`, `curr`, `cnt_b`, `i`, `a`, `b`) are modified by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, while the rest of the variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `curr` is the count of elements in the last sliding window of size `m` from `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing, `cnt_b` has its counts set to 0 for all elements in `b_values`, `n`, `m`, `k` are the values read from the input, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `i` has iterated through all elements in `b_values`.**
