Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `curr` is the count of elements in the last sliding window of size `m` from `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing, `cnt_b` has its counts set to 0 for all elements in `b_values`, `n`, `m`, `k` are the values read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` has iterated through all elements in `b_values`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    cnt_b[b[i]] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `curr` is the count of elements in the last sliding window of size `m` from `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing, `cnt_b` has its counts incremented by 1 for the element `b[i]`, `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` has iterated through all elements in `b_values`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `curr` is the count of elements in the last sliding window of size `m` from `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing, `cnt_b` has its counts incremented by 1 for the element `b[0]`, `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `curr` is the count of elements in the last sliding window of size `m` from `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing, `cnt_b` has its counts incremented by 1 for the element `b[0]` and `b[1]`, `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
