The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which takes values from the iterable `b_values`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `i` changes and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue executing.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element of `b_values` that was processed, and `cnt_b[i]` was set to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `b_values` to process.

Since `b_values` must contain at least two elements, and we've just processed one of them, there must still be at least one more element left in `b_values` for the loop to continue. The variable `i` will take the value of the next element in `b_values`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next element in `b_values`.

State: **`b_values` must contain at least two elements; `cnt_b[i]` is 0; `i` is the next element in `b_values`**
