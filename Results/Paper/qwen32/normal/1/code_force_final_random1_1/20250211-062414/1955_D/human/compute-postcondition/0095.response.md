The code snippet `b_values = set(b)` updates the `b_values` variable to be a set containing unique elements from the list `b`. This means that any duplicate elements in `b` are removed in `b_values`.

The other variables (`ans`, `curr`, `cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop; `curr` is the final count of valid matches between the last window of `a` (from `a[n-m]` to `a[n-1]`) and `b_values`; `cnt_b` reflects the final counts of elements from `b` after processing all windows of `a` with `cnt_b[b[i]]` incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
