Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is 2 if `curr - 2` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 3 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 1 otherwise. `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `b_values` remain unchanged. `i` is `x + 1`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and `curr` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0.**
