Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is 2 if `curr - 2` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 3 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 1 otherwise. `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `b_values` remain unchanged. `i` is `x + 1`. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1.**
