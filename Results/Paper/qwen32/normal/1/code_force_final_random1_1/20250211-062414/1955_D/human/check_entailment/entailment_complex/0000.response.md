### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by efficiently counting the number of subarrays of length `m` in array `a` that have at least `k` elements matching those in array `b`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach and correctness verification:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_val` is set to 1,000,000, which is the maximum possible value for elements in `a` and `b`.
   - `cnt_b` is an array of size `max_val + 1` initialized to zero. This array keeps track of the count of each element in `b`.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read.
   - Arrays `a` and `b` are read.

3. **Counting Elements in `b`**:
   - For each element in `b`, its count is incremented in `cnt_b`.

4. **Processing the First Subarray**:
   - A set `b_values` is created from `b` for quick membership checking.
   - The first subarray of length `m` in `a` is processed:
     - If an element in this subarray is in `b_values`, its count in `cnt_b` is decremented, and if the count remains non-negative, `curr` (current count of matching elements) is incremented.
   - If `curr` is at least `k`, `ans` (the count of good subarrays) is incremented.

5. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - For each subsequent subarray (obtained by sliding the window one position to the right), the following steps are performed:
     - If the element that is sliding out of the window was in `b_values`, its count in `cnt_b` is incremented, and if the count becomes positive, `curr` is decremented.
     - If the new element that is sliding into the window is in `b_values`, its count in `cnt_b` is decremented, and if the count remains non-negative, `curr` is incremented.
     - If `curr` is at least `k`, `ans` is incremented.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all subarrays for a test case, the count of good subarrays (`ans`) is printed.
   - `cnt_b` is reset for the next test case by setting counts of elements in `b_values` back to zero.

### Verification:

- **Efficiency**: The algorithm uses a sliding window technique, ensuring that each element of `a` is processed at most twice (once when entering and once when exiting the window). Thus, the time complexity is O(t * n), which is efficient given the constraints.
- **Correctness**: The algorithm correctly maintains the count of matching elements using the `cnt_b` array and updates it efficiently as the window slides. The use of a set `b_values` ensures that membership checks are fast.
- **Edge Cases**: The algorithm handles edge cases such as `k = m` (all elements must match) and `k = 1` (at least one element must match).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and efficient for the problem at hand.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
