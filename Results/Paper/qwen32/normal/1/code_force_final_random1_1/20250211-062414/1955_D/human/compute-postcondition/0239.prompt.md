Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `curr` is the total number of elements in `a` that are in `b` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b` after decrementing; `cnt_b` reflects the decrements for elements found in `a`; `n`, `m`, `k` are the values read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is 2 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than or equal to 0 before the decrement. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` are the values read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was initially non-negative. Otherwise, `ans`, `curr`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged. `ans` is 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 3 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 1 otherwise. `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `b_values` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is either 2, 3, or 4 depending on its initial value before the if statement. `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `b_values` remain unchanged. `i` is `x + 1`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` could be 2, 3, or 4 based on its initial value; otherwise, `ans` remains as initially determined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
