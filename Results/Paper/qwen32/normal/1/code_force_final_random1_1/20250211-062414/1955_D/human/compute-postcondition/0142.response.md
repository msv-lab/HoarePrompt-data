Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1; `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was initially non-negative; `ans` is unchanged; `n` is greater than `m`; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1.**
