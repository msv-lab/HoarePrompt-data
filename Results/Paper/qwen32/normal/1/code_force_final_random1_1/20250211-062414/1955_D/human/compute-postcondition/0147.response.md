The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. Given that `i` is 4, the specific element being incremented is `a[4]`.

Here's the updated state:

- `cnt_b[a[4]]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`b_values`, `curr`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `curr` is unchanged; `ans` is unchanged; `n` is greater than `m`; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is 4; `cnt_b[a[4]]` is incremented by 1.**
