The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5. Additionally, `m` must be greater than 5 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 5, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[4]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is 5**
