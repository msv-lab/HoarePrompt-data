### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by using a sliding window approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cnt_b` is initialized to keep track of the count of each element in array `b`. This helps in determining how many times each element of `b` appears in the current window of `a`.
   - `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It increments the count of each element in `b` in the `cnt_b` array.
   - It initializes `ans` to count the number of good subarrays and `curr` to keep track of the current number of matches in the initial window of size `m`.

3. **Initial Window Check**:
   - The program checks the first window of size `m` in `a` and updates `curr` accordingly.
   - If `curr` (number of matches) is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program slides the window one element to the right at a time.
   - It adjusts the counts in `cnt_b` and `curr` based on the element that exits the window (`a[i]`) and the element that enters the window (`a[i + m]`).
   - After adjusting the counts, it checks if the new `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it increments `ans`.

5. **Resetting for Next Test Case**:
   - After processing each test case, it resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to zero for the next test case.

### Verification Against Provided States:
- The program correctly processes multiple test cases.
- It uses a sliding window to efficiently check each subarray of length `m` in `a`.
- It correctly updates the count of matches (`curr`) as the window slides.
- It resets the necessary counters between test cases to avoid interference.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described and verified against the provided states.
