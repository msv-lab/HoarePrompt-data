Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `curr` is the count of elements in the last sliding window of size `m` from `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing, `cnt_b` has its counts incremented by 1 for the element `b[0]` and `b[1]`, `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1**

Natural Language Explanation: The count of the element `b[1]` in `cnt_b` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
