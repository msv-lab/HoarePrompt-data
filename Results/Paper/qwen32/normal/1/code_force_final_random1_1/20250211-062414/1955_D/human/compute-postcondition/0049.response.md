Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `curr` is the total number of valid matches between elements in `a` and `b_values` after considering the counts in `cnt_b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0, `curr` is incremented by 1 and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` or `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is 0, `curr` and `cnt_b` remain unchanged. `n` must be greater than `m`.**
