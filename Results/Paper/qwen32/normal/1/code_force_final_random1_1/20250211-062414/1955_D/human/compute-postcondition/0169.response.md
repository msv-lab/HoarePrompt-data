The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. This operation does not affect the other variables listed in the initial state.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `curr` is the count of elements in the last sliding window of size `m` from `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing, `cnt_b` has its counts set to 0 for all elements in `b_values`, `n`, `m`, `k` are the values read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` has iterated through all elements in `b_values`.**
