Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `a[4]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[4]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[4]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[4]]` and `curr` remain unchanged. `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` is updated to the third integer from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. `i` is 4. `cnt_b[a[4 + m]]` is decremented by 1. Since the condition `cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0` is always true (as `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 in the precondition), `curr` is incremented by 1. `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
