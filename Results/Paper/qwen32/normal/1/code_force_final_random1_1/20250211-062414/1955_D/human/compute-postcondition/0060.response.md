Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0. `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged. `n` is greater than `m`. `i` is `i + 1`. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative; counts of other elements in `cnt_b` remain unchanged.**
