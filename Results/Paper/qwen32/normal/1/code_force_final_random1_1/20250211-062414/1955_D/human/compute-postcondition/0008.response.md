The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's assume it is `i-1` since it was incremented at the end of the previous iteration), and `m` is the number of iterations the loop should run, which is given and must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `i-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` was `i-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `i` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is [value of i from the previous iteration] + 1**.

To generalize, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is 4** (assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration).

However, without knowing the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is [previous value of i] + 1**

Given the information, the most accurate representation would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is 4** (if `i` was 3 previously).

But in general terms:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is [previous value of i] + 1**

Since we don't have the exact previous value of `i`, we can say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is 4** (assuming `i` was 3 previously).

However, the most general answer without specific values is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is [previous value of i] + 1**

Given the examples, let's assume `i` was 3 previously, so:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is 4**

So the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and the count of `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1, `i` is 4**
