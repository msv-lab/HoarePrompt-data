Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n`. It also receives two lists: `a` containing `n` integers and `b` containing `m` integers, with each element in the lists satisfying `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
