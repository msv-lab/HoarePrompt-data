Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 2 if `curr - 2` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 3 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 1 otherwise; `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `b_values` remain unchanged; `i` is `x + 1`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `curr` is decremented by 1, affecting the conditions for determining `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
