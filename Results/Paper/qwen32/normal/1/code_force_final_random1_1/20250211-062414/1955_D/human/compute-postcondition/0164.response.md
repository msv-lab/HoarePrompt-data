Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing at least one element, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `curr` is the count of elements in the last sliding window of size `m` from `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing, `cnt_b` has its counts decremented for each occurrence of elements from `a` that are in `b` during the loop except for `cnt_b[i]` which is now 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is the next element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**.

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `cnt_b[i]` has been explicitly set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged, including `b_values`, `ans`, `curr`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `i`.
