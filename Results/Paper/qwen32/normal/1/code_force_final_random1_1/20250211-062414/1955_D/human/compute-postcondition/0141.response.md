Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1; `curr` is `curr + 1`; `ans` is unchanged; `n` is greater than `m`; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `curr` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
