The code initializes a list `cnt_b` with zeros, having a length of `max_val + 1`. Given that `max_val` is 1,000,000, the list `cnt_b` will have 1,000,001 elements, all set to 0.

No other variables are affected by this line of code. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `max_val` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `max_val` is 1000000; `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, all initialized to 0.**
