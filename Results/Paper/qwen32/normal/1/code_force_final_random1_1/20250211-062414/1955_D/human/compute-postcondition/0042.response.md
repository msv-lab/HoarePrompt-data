Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `curr` is the total number of valid matches between elements in `a` and `b_values` after considering the counts in `cnt_b`. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1. `cnt_b` is updated to reflect the remaining counts of elements from `b` with `cnt_b[a[i]]` incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `m`; `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
