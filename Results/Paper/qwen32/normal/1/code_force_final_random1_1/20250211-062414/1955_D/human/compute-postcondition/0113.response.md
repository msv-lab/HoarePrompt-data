Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is either 0 or 3; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, `curr` is updated to 1; otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.**
