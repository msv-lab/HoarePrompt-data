Correctness: **False**

The provided program includes several utility functions (`func_1` through `func_9`) but does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. The core logic for determining the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array is missing. To correctly solve this problem, the program should implement an algorithm that calculates the desired result based on the input data.
