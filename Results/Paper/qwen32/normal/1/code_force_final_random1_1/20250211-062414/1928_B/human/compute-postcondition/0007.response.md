The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `tem` is `arr[1] * arr[0]` and `ans` initially contains only `arr[1]`. After appending `tem` to `ans`, `ans` will now contain two elements: `arr[1]` and `arr[1] * arr[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is a list containing `arr[1]` and `arr[1] * arr[0]`, `tem` is `arr[1] * arr[0]`, `i` is `0`**.
