The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from the last index of `arr` down to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was used to access the current element of `arr`, and the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used to access an element in `arr`, and since the loop decrements `i` by 1, we need to decrement `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given that `i` was used to access `arr[i]` in the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i - 1`.

Since the loop runs from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`, if `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have terminated. Therefore, `i` must have been greater than `0` at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, where `k > 0`. Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize that `i` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

So, if `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `0`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]`, `tem` is `arr[i]`, `i` is `i - 1`**

To provide a concrete example, let's assume `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is a list containing `arr[1]`, `tem` is `arr[1]`, `i` is `0`**

But since we are not given the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the most accurate generalization is:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]`, `tem` is `arr[i]`, `i` is `i - 1`**

Given the requirement to provide a specific state, let's assume `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration for concreteness:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is a list containing `arr[1]`, `tem` is `arr[1]`, `i` is `0`**
