The code multiplies the variable `tem` by the element at index `i` of the list `arr`. Given that `tem` is initially 1, `tem` will now hold the value of `arr[i]`. The values of `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is `arr[i]`**.
