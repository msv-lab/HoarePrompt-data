To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` step-by-step using the provided initial state.

### Given Variables and Conditions:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is 1
- `a` is 1
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`
- `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`

### Expression Breakdown:
We need to evaluate `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.

1. **Value of `a`:**
   - `a` is explicitly given as 1.
   
2. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   
3. **Value of `b`:**
   - `b` is defined as `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`.
   - We do not have explicit values for `r` and `l`, but we can express `b` in terms of these variables.
   
4. **Expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`:**
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 = 1 * 2 + b * 2 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 2b + 2 = 4 + 2b
     \]
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to `4 + 2b`.

### Determining `b`:
- Since `b` depends on `r` and `l`, and these are not explicitly provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `b`.
- However, we can express the final output in terms of `b`.

### Final Output:
Given the expression `4 + 2b`, where `b` is defined as `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`, the output will be `4 + 2b`.

Output: **4 + 2b (where b is (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1))**
