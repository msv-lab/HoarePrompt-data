The code appends `0` to the list `B`. Since the initial state does not specify the initial contents of `B`, we assume `B` was initially empty or had some unspecified values. After appending `0`, `B` now contains `[0]`.

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `j`, `j_old`, `i`) are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`, `B = [0]`**.
