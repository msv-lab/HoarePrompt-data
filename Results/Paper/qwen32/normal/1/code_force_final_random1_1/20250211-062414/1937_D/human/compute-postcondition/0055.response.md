The code appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given that `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`, the new state of `idx_B` will depend on whether it was initially empty or not.

If `idx_B` was initially empty (`len(idx_B) == 0`), then `B` was `[0]` and `idx_B` was `[]`. After appending `i`, `idx_B` becomes `[i]` and `B` remains `[0]`.

If `idx_B` was not initially empty, then `x` was `20` and `B` was `[20]`. After appending `i`, `idx_B` becomes `[20, i]` and `B` remains `[20]`.

Since the problem does not specify the initial length of `idx_B`, both scenarios are possible. However, we can describe the updated state in a general form:

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` is greater than `j_old + 2`, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`, `idx_B` is either `[i]` or `[20, i]`, `B` is either `[0]` or `[20]`.**
