To determine the new value of `b` after executing the given line of code, let's break down the expression:

Given:
- `b` is initially `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)]`
- The line of code modifies `b` as follows: `b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`

We need to compute the new value of `b` using the given formula.

First, let's express the new value of `b`:
\[ b_{\text{new}} = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) \times (x + 1) \]

Where:
- `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)]`
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`
- `idx_B[x]` is the element at index `x` in the list `idx_B`
- `idx_B[r - 1]` is the element at index `r - 1` in the list `idx_B`

Since `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, we can substitute this into the equation:
\[ b_{\text{new}} = (B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)]) - (idx_B[r - (l + 2)] - idx_B[r - 1]) \times (r - (l + 2) + 1) \]

Simplifying further:
\[ b_{\text{new}} = (B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)]) - (idx_B[r - (l + 2)] - idx_B[r - 1]) \times (r - l - 1) \]

Given the initial state, we know the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B`. However, since `l` and `r` are not specified, we cannot compute exact numerical values for `b` and `b_new`. But we can express the new value of `b` in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is `A[l]` where `l` is an undefined index, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `(B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)]) - (idx_B[r - (l + 2)] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - l - 1)`**
