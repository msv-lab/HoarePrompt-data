To determine the output state, let's evaluate the given code snippet:

Given:
- Initial State: `A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is not equal to 0, `a = 3`
- Code Snippet: `a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`

First, identify the values used in the equation:
- `a` is initially 3.
- `l` is 0, but since `l - 1` is used, we need to consider `idx_A[-1]`. In Python, `idx_A[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `idx_A`, which is 5.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, but it is used in the equation. Since `i` is not specified, we cannot compute a numerical value for `a`. However, we can express the new value of `a` in terms of `i`.

The equation becomes:
\[ a = 3 + (i - 5) \times 0 \]

Since any number multiplied by 0 is 0, the equation simplifies to:
\[ a = 3 + 0 \]
\[ a = 3 \]

Thus, the value of `a` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is not equal to 0, `a = 3`**

In natural language, the output state remains the same as the initial state because the value of `a` does not change due to the given operation.
