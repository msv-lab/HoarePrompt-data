The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. This means that `idx_A` will now contain its previous elements plus the new element `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `A` is either an empty list, a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`, or a list with three elements `[a_0, x, 0]` if `idx_A` was empty, or `[a_0, x, x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)]` if `idx_A` was not empty.
- `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

After executing `idx_A.append(i)`, the only variable that changes is `idx_A`, which now includes the new element `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` is either an empty list, a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`, or a list with three elements `[a_0, x, 0]` if `idx_A` was empty, or `[a_0, x, x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A) - 1]` if `idx_A` was not empty; `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
