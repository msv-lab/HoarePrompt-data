The code calculates the value of `x` using the formula `r - (l + 2)`. Given the initial values `l = 0` and `r = 3`, the calculation proceeds as follows:

\[ x = 3 - (0 + 2) \]
\[ x = 3 - 2 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

Therefore, `x` is assigned the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is `'>'`, `a = 0`, `x = 1`**
