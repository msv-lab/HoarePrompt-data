The given code snippet increments the variable `l` by 1. This change affects only the variable `l`, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `l < r`, then `a` is `A[l]` where `l` is an undefined index, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l >= r`, then if `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. `l` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The list `A`, list `idx_A`, list `B`, list `idx_B`, the condition that `n` is greater than 0, the condition that `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, and the increment of `i` remain unchanged. The value of `l` is increased by 1. The conditions involving `l` and `r` for determining `a`, `x`, and `b` remain as described in the initial state.
