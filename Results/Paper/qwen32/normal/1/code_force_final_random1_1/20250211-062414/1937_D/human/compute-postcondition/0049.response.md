To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration: `A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`. If `s[i] == '<'`, then `idx_B` includes the newly appended value `i`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Let's analyze the state adjustments:

1. **Variable `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `j_old`.
   - At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `j_old + 1`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than `j + 1`.
   - Since `j` is now `j_old + 1`, the condition becomes `n > (j_old + 1) + 1` or `n > j_old + 2`.

Other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `i`, `s`, `idx_B`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be modified based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than `j_old + 2`, `j` is `j_old + 1`**
