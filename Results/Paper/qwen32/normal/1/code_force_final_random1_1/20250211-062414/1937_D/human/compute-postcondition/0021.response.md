The code appends `0` to the list `A`. Given the initial state, `A` could have been an empty list, a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`, or a list with three elements `[a_0, x, 0]` or `[a_0, x, x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A) - 1]`.

After appending `0` to `A`, the possible states of `A` become:
- If `A` was initially an empty list, it becomes `[0]`.
- If `A` was initially `[a_0, x]`, it becomes `[a_0, x, 0]`.
- If `A` was initially `[a_0, x, 0]`, it becomes `[a_0, x, 0, 0]`.
- If `A` was initially `[a_0, x, x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A) - 1]`, it becomes `[a_0, x, x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A) - 1, 0]`.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `idx_A`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` is either `[0]`, `[a_0, x, 0]`, `[a_0, x, 0, 0]`, or `[a_0, x, x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A) - 1, 0]`; `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'; `i` is [previous value of i] + 1.**
