Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is either decreased by 1 or set to 1, `a` is either `0` or `1` depending on the new value of `r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]` where `1 <= l <= 3`. Specifically, if `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `r` is set to 1 and `b` is 1. Otherwise, `r` is simply decreased by 1.**
