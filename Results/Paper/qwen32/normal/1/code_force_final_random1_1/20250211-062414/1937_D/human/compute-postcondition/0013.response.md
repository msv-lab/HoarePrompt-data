The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value, and since the loop is about to start again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `A` is either an empty list or a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`.
- `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is either an empty list or a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`, and `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>', `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` is the only variable we can adjust, and it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, we update `i` accordingly.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is either an empty list or a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`, `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>', `i` is `i + 1`**

To make it clear, let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Now, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is either an empty list or a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`, `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>', `i` is `k + 1`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is either an empty list or a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`, `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>', `i` is incremented by 1**
