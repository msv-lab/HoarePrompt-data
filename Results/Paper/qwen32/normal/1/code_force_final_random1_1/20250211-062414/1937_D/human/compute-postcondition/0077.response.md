The code snippet `b = A[l - 1]` attempts to access an element in list `A` using the index `l - 1`. Given that `l` is 0, `l - 1` evaluates to `-1`, which in Python accesses the last element of the list.

Given the initial state, `A = [0, 1, 3]`, the last element (at index `-1`) is `3`. Therefore, `b` is assigned the value `3`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the updated state is:

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is `'>'`, `a = 3 - 3 * i`, `b = 3`**
