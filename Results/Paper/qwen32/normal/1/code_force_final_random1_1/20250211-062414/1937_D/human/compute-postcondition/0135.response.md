Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `r` is not equal to 0, then `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**
