Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is either an empty list, a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`, or a list with three elements `[a_0, x, 0]` if `idx_A` was empty, or `[a_0, x, x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)]` if `idx_A` was not empty, `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>', and `i` is incremented by 1.**
