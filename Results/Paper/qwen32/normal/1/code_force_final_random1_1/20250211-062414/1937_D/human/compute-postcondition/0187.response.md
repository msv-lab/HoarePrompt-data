Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1. If `r - l >= 0`, then `r` is decreased by 1 and `b` is set to 3. Otherwise, `r` and `b` remain unchanged. `a` is `-2` if `l` is 1, `a` is `-6` if `l` is 2, `a` is `-12` if `l` is 3.**
