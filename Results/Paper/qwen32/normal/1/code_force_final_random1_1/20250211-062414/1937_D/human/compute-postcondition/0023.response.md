Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` is updated with its last element as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` and a new element `x` appended; `idx_A` remains the same list; `i` is [previous value of i] + 1; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `A` now includes an additional element, which is the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `A`, which has grown by one element.
