To determine the new value of `b`, we need to evaluate the expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` and add it to the current value of `b`.

Given:
- `b` is initially `3`.
- `l` is `0`.
- `r` is `3`.
- `idx_A` is `[3, 4, 5]`.
- `i` is not explicitly given, but it's part of the expression.

Since `l` is `0`, `l - 1` would be `-1`, which is an index out of bounds for `idx_A`. However, since the problem statement mentions that the condition `l - r > 0` is false and the state remains unchanged, we should assume that the code does not execute due to potential out-of-bounds access or some other control flow mechanism not shown here.

However, if we hypothetically proceed with the calculation assuming no runtime errors:

- `idx_A[l - 1]` would be `idx_A[-1]`, which is `5`.
- The expression becomes `(i - 5) * 3`.
- Adding this to `b` results in `b = 3 + (i - 5) * 3`.

Since `i` is not specified, we cannot compute a numerical value for `b`. But based on the problem statement, the state remains unchanged because of the condition `l - r > 0` being false.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is `'>'`, `a = 3 - 3 * i`, `b = 3`**.
