Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
a = B[r]
```

Since `r` is decreased by 1 before this line, we need to consider the value of `r` just before executing this line. Let's assume `r` was initially some value `k`. After `r` is decreased by 1, `r` becomes `k-1`.

Given that `B = [0, 1, 3]`, the value of `a` will depend on the value of `r` (which is now `k-1`). Since `r` is decreased by 1, we need to consider the possible values of `k` such that `k-1` is within the bounds of the list `B`.

If `r` was initially 3 (meaning `k` was 4), then `r` becomes 2, and `a = B[2] = 3`.
If `r` was initially 2 (meaning `k` was 3), then `r` becomes 1, and `a = B[1] = 1`.
If `r` was initially 1 (meaning `k` was 2), then `r` becomes 0, and `a = B[0] = 0`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact initial value of `r`, we can only express `a` in terms of `r` after it has been decreased by 1. However, we know that `r` must be a valid index for the list `B`, which means `r` could be 2, 1, or 0 after being decreased by 1.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `r` was initially 3, making `r` equal to 2 after the decrement. Thus, `a = B[2] = 3`.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `r` is 2, `a` is 3**.
