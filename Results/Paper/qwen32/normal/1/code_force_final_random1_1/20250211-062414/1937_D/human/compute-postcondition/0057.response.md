To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the conditions under which `B` and `idx_B` are modified.

### Analysis:
- The loop runs `n` times.
- In each iteration, `i` is calculated as `n - 1 - j`.
- If `s[i] == '<'`, the following operations occur:
  - If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is initialized with `[0]`.
  - Otherwise, a new element is appended to `B` using the formula `x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.
  - `idx_B` appends the current `i`.

### Given Information:
- Initial State: `A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = []`, `idx_B = []`
- The string `s` is not explicitly given, but we can infer its structure from the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

### Inferences:
- After 1 iteration, `B` becomes `[0]` and `idx_B` becomes `[i]` if `s[i] == '<'`.
- After 2 iterations, `B` remains `[0]` and `idx_B` becomes `[i1, i2]` if both `s[i1]` and `s[i2]` are `'<'`.
- After 3 iterations, `B` could be `[0, x]` and `idx_B` could be `[i1, i2, i3]` if all `s[i1]`, `s[i2]`, and `s[i3]` are `'<'`.

### Generalizing:
If `s[i] == '<'` for all `i` from `n-1` down to `0`, `B` and `idx_B` will grow accordingly. Let's assume `s[i] == '<'` for all iterations for simplicity, as no other information is provided.

### Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 3` for simplicity (since we have data for 3 iterations).

- Iteration 1 (`j = 0`, `i = 2`):
  - `s[2] == '<'`: `B = [0]`, `idx_B = [2]`

- Iteration 2 (`j = 1`, `i = 1`):
  - `s[1] == '<'`: `x = 0 + (2 - 1) * 1 = 1`, `B = [0, 1]`, `idx_B = [2, 1]`

- Iteration 3 (`j = 2`, `i = 0`):
  - `s[0] == '<'`: `x = 1 + (1 - 0) * 2 = 3`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`

### Final Output State:
Given the pattern and assuming `s[i] == '<'` for all `i`, the final output state after all iterations would be:

Output State: **A = [0, 1, 3], idx_A = [3, 4, 5], B = [0, 1, 3], idx_B = [2, 1, 0]**

This means that if the string `s` consists entirely of `'<'` characters, `B` will contain the cumulative values calculated as described, and `idx_B` will simply be the indices in reverse order from `n-1` to `0`.
