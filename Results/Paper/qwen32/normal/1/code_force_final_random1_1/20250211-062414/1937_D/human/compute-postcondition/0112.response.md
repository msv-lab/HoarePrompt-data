Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 2`, `a = 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `l` is greater than `r` (False), `r` is not equal to `0`, and if `l - r - 1 > 0` is True, then `b` is set to 1. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.**
