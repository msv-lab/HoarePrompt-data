To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
```

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `A` is either an empty list or a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`.
- `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Let's break down the calculation of `x`:
- `A[len(A) - 1]` refers to the last element of `A`. Since `A` can be either empty or contain two elements, if `A` is not empty, `A[len(A) - 1]` would be `x` (if `A` has two elements) or `a_0` (if `A` has one element).
- `(i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1])` calculates the difference between the current index `i` and the last element in `idx_A`.
- `len(idx_A)` gives the number of elements in `idx_A`.

Given these points, let's consider the different scenarios:

1. **If `A` is not empty**:
   - `A[len(A) - 1]` is `x` (if `A` has two elements) or `a_0` (if `A` has one element).
   - `x` is updated to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.

2. **If `A` is empty**:
   - The operation cannot be performed directly because `A[len(A) - 1]` would raise an `IndexError`. However, since the problem specifies that `A` is either an empty list or a list with two elements, we assume `A` is not empty when this line is executed.

Let's assume `A` is not empty and proceed with the calculation:

- If `A` has two elements `[a_0, x]`, then `A[len(A) - 1]` is `x`.
- If `A` has one element `[a_0]`, then `A[len(A) - 1]` is `a_0`.

Since the problem does not specify which case we are in, we'll consider both possibilities:

1. **Case 1**: `A` has two elements `[a_0, x]`
   - `x` is updated to `x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.

2. **Case 2**: `A` has one element `[a_0]`
   - `x` is updated to `a_0 + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.

However, since `x` is being reassigned in both cases, we'll consider the general form:

- `x` is updated to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, and `i`) remain unchanged except for `x`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` is either an empty list or a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`; `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'; `i` is incremented by 1; `x` is updated to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.
