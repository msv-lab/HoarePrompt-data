Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: A = [0, 1, 3], idx_A = [3, 4, 5], B = [0, 1, 3], idx_B = [2, 1, 0], l = 0, r = 3
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`. If `s[i]` is `'>'`, then `l` is set to 1, and if `l < r`, `r` remains 3, `a` is set to `0` if `r` is 3, otherwise `a` is set to `3 - 3 * i`, and `b` is set to `3`. If `s[i]` is not `'>'`, then if `l` is 0 and `r` is greater than 0, `r` is set to 2. If `l` is not 0 and `r` is greater than 0, `l` remains 0, `r` is set to 2, `a` is set to 3, and `b` is set to `2 * i`. If `r` was initially 0, `r` remains 0, and `l` is not greater than `r`. Otherwise, `r` is set to 2, `a` is set to 3, `l` is not greater than `r`, `r` is not equal to 0, and `b` is set to `(i - 3) * 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] == '>'`, then if `l < r`, `a` is set to `A[l]`, `x` is set to `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is set to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l >= r`, and `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. `l` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] != '>'`, then `r` is decreased by 1 unless `r` was initially 0 or `l > r`, in which case `r` remains 0 or is set to 1. If `l <= r`, `a` is set to `i - 3` if `l = 1`, `2i - 7` if `l = 2`, `3i - 12` if `l = 3`, and `b` is updated to `(B[r] - B[r - l]) - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0` or `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l < 0`. If `l > r`, `a` is either `0` or `1` depending on the new value of `r`, and `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1`. If `s[i] == '>'`, then `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, and `b` remains unchanged. If `s[i] != '>'`, then if `l <= r`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is not 0, `b` is set to 3 and `a` is set to `-2` if `l` is 1, `a` is set to `-6` if `l` is 2, `a` is set to `-12` if `l` is 3. If `l > r`, then if `r` was 0, `r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `r` is set to 2 and `b` is set to -11.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
