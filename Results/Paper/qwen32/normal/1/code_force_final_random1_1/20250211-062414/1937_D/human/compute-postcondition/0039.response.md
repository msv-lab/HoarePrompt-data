The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given the initial conditions, `idx_B` could either be empty or non-empty. 

If `idx_B` was initially empty, then `B = [0]` and `idx_B = []`. After appending `i` to `idx_B`, `idx_B` will no longer be empty but will contain the single element `i`.

If `idx_B` was initially non-empty, it will now contain all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i`.

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `s[i]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i = n - 1 - j`, `s[i] == '<'`, `B = [0]` if `len(idx_B)` was initially 0, otherwise `B` remains unchanged, `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i`.**
