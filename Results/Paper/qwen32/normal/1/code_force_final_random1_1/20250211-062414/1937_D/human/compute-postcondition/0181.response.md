To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the specific details about the variables involved:

- `A = [0, 1, 3]`: This is a list of integers.
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`: This is another list of integers.
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`: This is a list of integers identical to `A`.
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`: This is another list of integers.
- `n` is greater than 0: This indicates that `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`: This suggests that `s` is a list where each element at index `i` is either `'>'` or something else.
- `i` is 1: This means the current index `i` is set to 1.
- `r` is decreased by 1: This indicates that `r` was previously some value, and it has been decremented by 1. However, the exact value of `r` is not relevant to the current `print` statement.

The `print` statement in question is:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

Given that `i` is 1, we can substitute this value into the expression `i + 1`:
- `i + 1` evaluates to `1 + 1`, which is `2`.

The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that after printing the value, a space should be added instead of the default newline character.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the number `2` followed by a space.

Output: **2 **
