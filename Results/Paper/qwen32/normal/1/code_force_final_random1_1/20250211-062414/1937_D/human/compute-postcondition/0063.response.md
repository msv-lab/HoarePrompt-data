The code assigns the value of `A[l]` to the variable `a`. Given that `l` is 0 and `A` is `[0, 1, 3]`, the value of `a` becomes `0`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is `'>'`, `a = 0`.**
