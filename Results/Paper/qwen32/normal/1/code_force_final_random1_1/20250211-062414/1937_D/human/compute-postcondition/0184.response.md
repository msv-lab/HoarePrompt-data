Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State: 
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is 1
- `r` is decreased by 1
- `a` is `-2` if `l` is 1, `a` is `-6` if `l` is 2, `a` is `-12` if `l` is 3

Code Snippet:
```python
b = B[r]
```

Since `r` is decreased by 1, we need to consider the possible values of `r` before the decrement. However, the exact value of `r` before the decrement is not specified, only that it is decreased by 1. Let's denote the value of `r` before the decrement as `r_initial`. Therefore, after the decrement, `r` is `r_initial - 1`.

Given that `B = [0, 1, 3]`, the value of `b` will depend on the value of `r` after the decrement. Since `r` is now `r_initial - 1`, the possible values for `b` are:
- If `r_initial - 1` is 0, then `b = B[0] = 0`
- If `r_initial - 1` is 1, then `b = B[1] = 1`
- If `r_initial - 1` is 2, then `b = B[2] = 3`

Since the exact value of `r_initial` is not given, we cannot determine a single specific value for `b`. However, we know that `b` will be one of the elements in `B`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `-2` if `l` is 1, `a` is `-6` if `l` is 2, `a` is `-12` if `l` is 3, `b` is `B[r]` which is either `0`, `1`, or `3` depending on the value of `r` after the decrement.**
