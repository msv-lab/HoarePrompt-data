To determine the output state, let's break down the given code snippet and apply the initial conditions:

The code snippet is:
```python
b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
```

Given:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is 1
- `r` is `r - 1`
- `a` is `-2` if `l` is 1, `a` is `-6` if `l` is 2, `a` is `-12` if `l` is 3
- `b` is `3`

We need to compute the new value of `b`.

First, identify the value of `idx_B[r - l]`:
- Since `r` is `r - 1`, we need to know the value of `r` and `l` to proceed. However, we don't have specific values for `r` and `l`. We'll assume `r` and `l` are such that `r - l` is a valid index for `idx_B`.

Let's assume `r` and `l` are such that `r - l` is within the bounds of `idx_B` (i.e., `0`, `1`, or `2`).

Let's consider each possible case for `r - l`:

1. If `r - l` is `0`:
   - `idx_B[0]` is `2`
   - `b = 3 - (2 - 1) * 0 = 3 - 0 = 3`

2. If `r - l` is `1`:
   - `idx_B[1]` is `1`
   - `b = 3 - (1 - 1) * 1 = 3 - 0 = 3`

3. If `r - l` is `2`:
   - `idx_B[2]` is `0`
   - `b = 3 - (0 - 1) * 2 = 3 - (-1) * 2 = 3 + 2 = 5`

Since the exact values of `r` and `l` are not specified, we consider the possible outcomes. However, typically in such problems, we assume the simplest scenario unless otherwise specified. Here, we'll assume `r - l` results in a valid index, and the most straightforward calculation is when `r - l` is `0` or `1`, which does not change `b`.

Therefore, the most likely output state, assuming `r - l` is `0` or `1`, is:
Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3], idx_A = [3, 4, 5], B = [0, 1, 3], idx_B = [2, 1, 0], n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is `-2` if `l` is 1, `a` is `-6` if `l` is 2, `a` is `-12` if `l` is 3, `b` is 3**.

If `r - l` is `2`, then:
Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3], idx_A = [3, 4, 5], B = [0, 1, 3], idx_B = [2, 1, 0], n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is `-2` if `l` is 1, `a` is `-6` if `l` is 2, `a` is `-12` if `l` is 3, `b` is 5**.

Given the problem's context, the most probable output state is:
Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3], idx_A = [3, 4, 5], B = [0, 1, 3], idx_B = [2, 1, 0], n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is `-2` if `l` is 1, `a` is `-6` if `l` is 2, `a` is `-12` if `l` is 3, `b` is 3**.
