Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, and the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'. If `idx_A` is an empty list, then `A` contains the single element 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with two elements `[a_0, x]` and `idx_A` is not an empty list.**
