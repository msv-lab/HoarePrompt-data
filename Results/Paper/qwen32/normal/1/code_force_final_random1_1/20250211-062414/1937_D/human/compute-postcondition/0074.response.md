To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `l = 0`
- `r = 0`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is `'>'`
- `l` is not less than `r`
- The current value of `r` is 0

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
- `r` is 0.
- `l` is 0 and it is not less than `r`, which is consistent with the given information.
- `s[i]` is `'>'`, but this does not directly affect the calculation in the print statement.
- The variable `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we need to infer its value or consider if it's part of the context not provided.

However, since `i` is not defined in the initial state and there is no additional context to determine its value, we can only express the output in terms of `n` and `i`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the result of `n - i`, where `n` is a positive integer and `i` is an integer whose value is not specified in the initial state.

Output: **n - i (where n is a positive integer and i is an integer)**
