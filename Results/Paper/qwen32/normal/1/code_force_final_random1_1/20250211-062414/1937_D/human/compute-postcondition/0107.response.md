The code assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `r` is 2, and `B = [0, 1, 3]`. Therefore, `a` will be assigned the value `3`.

The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `l` is greater than `r`, and `r` is not equal to `0` are still valid.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 2`, `a = 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `l` is greater than `r`, and `r` is not equal to `0`**.
