Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than the current `j + 1`, `j` is incremented by 1

Code Snippet:
```python
i = n - 1 - j
```

Since `j` is incremented by 1 before this line, we need to consider the new value of `j`. Let's denote the old value of `j` as `j_old`. After the increment, `j` becomes `j_old + 1`.

The code assigns the value `n - 1 - j` to `i`. Since `j` is now `j_old + 1`, we can substitute `j` in the equation:

`i = n - 1 - (j_old + 1) = n - 2 - j_old`

Thus, `i` is calculated as `n - 2 - j_old`.

The lists `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged, and the condition `n` must be greater than the current `j + 1` is still valid, but now `j` is `j_old + 1`.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`**

In natural language: The list `A` remains `[0, 1, 3]`, and the list `idx_A` remains `[3, 4, 5]`. The variable `j` has been incremented by 1, making its new value `j_old + 1`. The variable `i` is now calculated as `n - 2 - j_old`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `j + 1` still holds true.
