To determine the output state, let's first identify the relevant variables and their values before executing the given line of code.

Given:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is 1
- `r` is 2
- If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `a` is 3 and `b` is -2. Otherwise, `a` is 3 and `b` remains 1.

The line of code to execute is:
```python
b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
```

We need to know the value of `l` to proceed. However, since `l` is not defined in the initial state, we'll assume `l` is a variable that could take any value. For the sake of this example, let's assume `l` is 3 (a reasonable assumption since `l` is used as an index for `idx_A`).

Let's calculate the new value of `b`:

1. Calculate `i - idx_A[l - 1]`:
   - Given `i` is 1 and `l` is 3, `idx_A[l - 1]` is `idx_A[2]` which is 5.
   - So, `i - idx_A[l - 1]` is `1 - 5` which equals `-4`.

2. Calculate `(r + 1)`:
   - Given `r` is 2, `(r + 1)` is `2 + 1` which equals `3`.

3. Calculate the entire expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`:
   - This is `-4 * 3` which equals `-12`.

4. Update `b`:
   - Given `b` is initially 1 (from the condition `Otherwise, a is 3 and b remains 1`), the new value of `b` is `1 + (-12)` which equals `-11`.

Therefore, the updated value of `b` is `-11`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `r` is 2, `b` is -11**.
