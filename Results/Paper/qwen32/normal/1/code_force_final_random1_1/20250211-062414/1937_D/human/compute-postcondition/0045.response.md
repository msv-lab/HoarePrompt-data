The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. Given the initial state, `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2 - j_old)) * len(idx_B)`. After appending `x` to `B`, the length of `B` increases by 1, affecting the calculation of `x` in subsequent iterations.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`, `B` now includes the newly appended value `x`, which is `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - (n - 2 - j_old)) * len(idx_B)`**

In simpler terms, the list `B` now contains one additional element, which is the value of `x` calculated using the previous elements of `B` and `idx_B`. All other variables retain their original conditions and values.
