The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. Given that `x` is defined as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and since `A` was initially an empty list, `A[len(A) - 1]` would not exist. However, since this is a simulation and we need to follow the given conditions, let's assume the context implies that before this operation, `A` had at least one element (as the problem setup might imply a previous state not shown here).

Let's assume `A` had some value `a_0` before this operation, meaning `A[len(A) - 1]` would be `a_0`.

So, `x` would be calculated as:
\[ x = a_0 + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A) \]

After appending `x` to `A`, the new state of `A` would be `[a_0, x]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`, `idx_A` is not an empty list, and the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'**.

Here, `a_0` represents the initial element of `A` before the append operation, and `x` is calculated as described above.
