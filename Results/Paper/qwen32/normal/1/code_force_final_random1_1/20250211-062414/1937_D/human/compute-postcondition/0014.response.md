The code snippet appends the value `0` to the list `A`. Given the initial state, `A` could either be an empty list or a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`. After appending `0`, if `A` was initially empty, it will now be `[0]`. If `A` was initially `[a_0, x]`, it will now be `[a_0, x, 0]`.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `idx_A`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is either `[0]` or `[a_0, x, 0]`, `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>', `i` is incremented by 1**.
