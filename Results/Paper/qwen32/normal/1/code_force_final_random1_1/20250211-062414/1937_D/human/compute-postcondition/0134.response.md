To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step-by-step.

### Given Information:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`
- `b = \text{previous\_value\_of\_b} + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Analysis:

1. **Variables `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`
   - `b` is calculated as `previous_value_of_b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`

2. **Dependencies:**
   - `r` and `l` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but they are used in the calculations of `a` and `b`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified.
   - `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, but it does not directly affect the calculation of `a` and `b`.

3. **Calculation of `a` and `b`:**
   - Since `r` and `l` are not defined, we cannot compute exact values for `a` and `b`.
   - `a` depends on `B[r - 1]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, `i`, and `r`.
   - `b` depends on `previous_value_of_b`, `i`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, and `r`.

4. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
   - Given the dependencies on `r`, `l`, `i`, and `n`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value.

### Conclusion:
Since `r`, `l`, `i`, and `n` are not fully specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b = previous_value_of_b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r, n is greater than 0, and i is incremented by 1)**
