The code appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given the initial state, `i` is calculated as `n - 2 - j_old`. After appending `i` to `idx_B`, the length of `idx_B` increases by 1.

Since the initial state does not specify the current length of `idx_B` or the values of `n` and `j_old`, we can only describe the change in `idx_B` in terms of the appended value `i`.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`, `idx_B` includes the newly appended value `i`.**
