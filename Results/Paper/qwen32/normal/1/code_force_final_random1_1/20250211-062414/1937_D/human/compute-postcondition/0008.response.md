To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
```

Here's what happens:
- `A` is an empty list, so `A[len(A) - 1]` would normally refer to the last element of `A`. However, since `A` is empty, this part of the expression is undefined in a practical sense. For the sake of this exercise, we'll assume that the problem intends for us to consider the theoretical case where `A` had elements before this operation.
- `idx_A` is not an empty list, so `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` refers to the last element of `idx_A`.
- `i` is the current index in the string `s`, and the current character at index `i` is '>'.
- `len(idx_A)` gives the number of elements in `idx_A`.

Given these points, let's denote:
- `A_last` as the last element of `A` (hypothetically, since `A` is empty).
- `idx_A_last` as the last element of `idx_A`.

The expression for `x` then becomes:
\[ x = A_{\text{last}} + (i - \text{idx\_A\_last}) \times \text{len(idx\_A)} \]

Since `A` is empty, `A_last` is undefined, but for the purpose of this task, we'll keep it as `A[len(A) - 1]`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is not an empty list, and the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.

In simpler terms, `x` is calculated based on the last element of `A` (which is undefined since `A` is empty), the last element of `idx_A`, the current index `i`, and the length of `idx_A`. All other conditions remain the same.
