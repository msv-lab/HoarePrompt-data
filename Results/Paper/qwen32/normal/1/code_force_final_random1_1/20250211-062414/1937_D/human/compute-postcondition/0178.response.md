Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1. If `l < r`, then `a` is 1 and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`. Otherwise, if `r` is 0, no changes are made to `a` and `b`. If `r` is greater than 0, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is updated to `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**
