To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given Python code snippet based on the initial state provided:

Initial State: 
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `n` must be greater than `j + 1`
- `j` is `j_old + 1`
- `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`

Given Code:
```python
x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
```

From the initial state, we know the values of `A` and `idx_A`. However, `B` and `idx_B` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their specific values. We also know the relationships between `n`, `j`, and `i`, but we don't have specific values for `n`, `j`, and `i`.

Let's assume `B` and `idx_B` are lists with known lengths and values. Since these are not provided, we'll represent the final expression in terms of the elements of `B` and `idx_B`.

Given:
- `x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`

We can express `x` in terms of the last elements of `B` and `idx_B`, and the value of `i`.

Since `i` is defined as `n - 2 - j_old`, and `j` is `j_old + 1`, we can substitute `i` into the equation.

Let's assume `B` has length `L_B` and `idx_B` has length `L_idx_B`. Then:
- `x = B[L_B - 1] + (idx_B[L_idx_B - 1] - (n - 2 - j_old)) * L_idx_B`

Since we don't have specific values for `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, and `j_old`, we can only express `x` in this form.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2 - j_old)) * len(idx_B)`**

This output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the addition of the calculated value of `x` in terms of the undefined lists `B` and `idx_B`.
