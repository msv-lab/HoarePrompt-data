The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `B[x]` from it. Given that `x` is 1 and `B[1]` is 1, `b` is updated to `3 - 1`, which equals 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is `'>'`, `a = 0`, `x` is a non-negative integer with the current value of 1, `b = 2`**.
