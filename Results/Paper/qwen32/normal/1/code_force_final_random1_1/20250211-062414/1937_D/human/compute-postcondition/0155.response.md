To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, we need to carefully consider the initial conditions and the effect of the operation on the variable `b`.

Given:
- Initial State: `A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is either decreased by 1 or set to 1, `a` is either `0` or `1` depending on the new value of `r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]` where `1 <= l <= 3`. Specifically, if `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `r` is set to 1 and `b` is 1. Otherwise, `r` is simply decreased by 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
```

Let's break down the components:
- `b` is initially `A[l - 1]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `idx_A[l - 1]` is the element at index `l - 1` in the list `idx_A`.
- `r` is either decreased by 1 or set to 1 based on the condition `l - r - 1 > 0`.

The new value of `b` is calculated as:
\[ b_{\text{new}} = b_{\text{old}} + (i - \text{idx\_A}[l - 1]) \times (r + 1) \]

Since the exact values of `i`, `l`, and `r` are not specified, we can express the new value of `b` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is either decreased by 1 or set to 1, `a` is either `0` or `1` depending on the new value of `r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**

In natural language, the output state is: `A` remains `[0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A` remains `[3, 4, 5]`, `B` remains `[0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B` remains `[2, 1, 0]`, `n` is still greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is either decreased by 1 or set to 1, `a` is either `0` or `1` depending on the new value of `r`, and `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
