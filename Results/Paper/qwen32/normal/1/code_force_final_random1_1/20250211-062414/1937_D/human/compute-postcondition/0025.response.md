The given code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. This means that the length of `idx_A` increases by one, and the new element added is the current value of `i`.

Given the initial state, `idx_A` can either be an empty list or contain previous elements plus a new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'. After executing the line `idx_A.append(i)`, `idx_A` will definitely have the new element `i` appended to it.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` is either `[0]`, `[a_0, x, 0]`, `[a_0, x, 0, 0]`, `[a_0, x, x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A) - 1, 0]`, or updated with its last element as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` and a new element `x` appended; `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i`; `i` is [previous value of i] + 1; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` if `idx_A` is not empty.**
