Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`. `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order. `group_a` contains the first `na` elements of `numbers`, `group_b` contains the next `nb` elements of `numbers`, `group_c` contains the last `nc` elements of `numbers`. `sum_a` is the sum of the first `na` elements of `numbers`, `sum_b` is the sum of the next `nb` elements of `numbers`, `sum_c` is the sum of the last `nc` elements of `numbers`. Additionally, `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to True.**
