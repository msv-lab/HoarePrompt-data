In the given task, the loop iterates over the `numbers` list. The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the `numbers` list is properly defined and contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of integers.
- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.
- `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.
- `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0.

To ensure the loop executes, the `numbers` list must contain at least one element since the loop iterates over `numbers`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, this condition is already satisfied as `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers.

However, to adhere strictly to the requirement of adjusting only the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `numbers`. Since `numbers` is already defined to have `n` elements and `n` is a positive integer, no further adjustment is needed for `numbers` itself in terms of ensuring the loop executes.

Therefore, the state remains as provided, with the understanding that `numbers` is correctly initialized with `n` elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0**.
