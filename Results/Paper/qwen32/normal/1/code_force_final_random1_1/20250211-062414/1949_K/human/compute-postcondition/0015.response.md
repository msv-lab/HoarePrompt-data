Functionality: **The function takes a positive integer `n`, three other positive integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` such that their sum equals `n`, and a list of `n` positive integers. It sorts the list in descending order and attempts to distribute the numbers into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc`. If the condition specified in `func_1` is met with the sums of these groups, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
