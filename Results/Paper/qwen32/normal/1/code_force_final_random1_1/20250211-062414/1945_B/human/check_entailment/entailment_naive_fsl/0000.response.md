Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Two installations launch fireworks at intervals `a` and `b` minutes respectively.
- Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
- We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of fireworks visible within a certain time frame (`mn = min(a, b) + m`). It then calculates how many fireworks from each installation would be visible within this timeframe and sums them up.

Here's the program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        mn = min(a, b) + m
        if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1):
            print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
        else:
            print(mn // a + mn // b)
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling Overlaps:** The program does not account for overlaps between fireworks from different installations. For example, if a firework from the first installation is launched at time `x` and a firework from the second installation is launched at time `y` such that `|x - y| <= m`, they will overlap and both will be visible at the same time.
2. **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle cases where `a` or `b` is 1, which means fireworks are launched every minute. This could lead to incorrect counts.
3. **General Calculation:** The program uses `min(a, b) + m` as the time frame to check for fireworks, but this might not be sufficient to capture all overlapping fireworks.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 3 4
```
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times: 2, 4, 6, 8, ...
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times: 3, 6, 9, ...
- Within the first 8 minutes, fireworks are launched at the following times:
  - First installation: 2, 4, 6, 8
  - Second installation: 3, 6, 9
- Fireworks launched at times 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 will be visible at various points in time, leading to overlaps.

The program calculates:
- `mn = min(2, 3) + 4 = 7`
- Number of fireworks from the first installation within 7 minutes: `7 // 2 = 3`
- Number of fireworks from the second installation within 7 minutes: `7 // 3 = 2`
- Total fireworks: `3 + 2 = 5`

However, the correct answer should be `6` because:
- Fireworks at times 2 and 3 overlap.
- Fireworks at times 4 and 3 overlap.
- Fireworks at times 6 and 6 overlap.
- Fireworks at times 8 and 6 overlap.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle overlaps and edge cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not account for overlaps between fireworks from different installations and may not handle edge cases properly.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to correctly calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks due to not considering overlaps between fireworks from different installations and not handling edge cases where `a` or `b` is 1.
