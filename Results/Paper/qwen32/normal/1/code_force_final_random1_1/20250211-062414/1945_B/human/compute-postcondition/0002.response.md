The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an input integer within a certain range, which is not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.**
