Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

The game revolves around the bitwise XOR of the numbers in the sequence. Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero, otherwise, Bob wins. Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to find the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve plays optimally.

#### Key Observations:
1. **XOR Properties**: 
   - XOR of two identical numbers is `0`.
   - XOR of a number with `0` is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers is zero.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero as often as possible by removing numbers strategically.

#### Strategy Breakdown:
- If there is an odd count of numbers that contribute to a non-zero XOR (i.e., 1s, 3s), Bob can win when all such numbers are removed, leaving an even count of them which results in a zero XOR.
- If there are an even count of 1s and 3s, Bob can win when pairs of these numbers are removed, leaving an even count of them which results in a zero XOR.
- Numbers 2 and 4 do not affect the parity of the XOR since `2 XOR 2 = 0` and `4 XOR 4 = 0`.

### Solution Analysis:

The provided solution attempts to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

#### Code Explanation:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

- `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`: This line attempts to convert the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s into even numbers by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2. However, this operation does not correctly reflect the logic needed for determining Bob's wins.
- `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)`: This checks if all three counts (1s, 2s, 3s) are odd. If they are, it adds 1 to the result, indicating that Bob can win once initially.
- `sum(p) // 2`: This calculates half the total count of numbers, which does not correctly represent the optimal strategy for maximizing Bob's wins.

### Correctness Evaluation:

The provided solution does not accurately implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Specifically:
- It incorrectly modifies the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
- It does not correctly account for the optimal removal strategy by Eve.

Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
