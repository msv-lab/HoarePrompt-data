To determine the new value of `cnt` after the code `cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` is executed, we need to consider the current value of `cnt` and the value of `math.floor(x / 2)`. 

Given:
- `cnt` is initially 1 if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
- `x` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `math.floor(x / 2)` will yield an integer value.

Let's denote `math.floor(x / 2)` as `k`, where `k` is an integer. The new value of `cnt` will be `cnt + k`.

Thus, the output state will depend on the initial value of `cnt` and the value of `k`.

If `cnt` was initially 1:
- New `cnt` = 1 + `k`

If `cnt` was initially 0:
- New `cnt` = 0 + `k`

Since `k` is an integer derived from `math.floor(x / 2)`, we can express the final state as:

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`**
