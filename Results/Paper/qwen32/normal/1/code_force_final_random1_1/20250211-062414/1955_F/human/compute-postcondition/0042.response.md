Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value based on whether the first three counts are equal and odd, and adds half the value of each count (rounded down) to this value. It then prints the result for each test case.**
