Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case consists of four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) (where \( 0 \leq p_i \leq 200 \)) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence respectively. The total number of test cases \( t \) satisfies \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
        cnt += 1
    for x in a:
        cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` (either 0 or 1 based on the condition) plus the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all `x` in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all `x` in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
