You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Function Summary: 
For each test case consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence, the function calculates and prints a value based on the parity of the first three counts and the total count of numbers, effectively determining a derived count related to these inputs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers where each integer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
- Eve removes one number at a time until the sequence is empty.
- We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Key Points
- XOR of a sequence is zero if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.
- XOR is non-zero if at least one bit position has an odd count.
- Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in binary are `01`, `10`, `11`, and `100` respectively.
- To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero as often as possible.

### Program Analysis
The program provided is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
2. **Processing Counts**:
   - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`: This line attempts to adjust the counts. However, the subtraction of `int(x) % 2` does not make logical sense in this context. It effectively makes all counts even, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3`: This checks if exactly three out of the first three counts (counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s) are odd. This condition alone is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - `sum(p) // 2`: This part sums up all the counts (after the adjustment) and divides by 2. The division by 2 does not align with the logic needed to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Issues Identified
- The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win.
- The adjustments made to the counts (`int(x) - int(x) % 2`) do not align with the problem's requirements.
- The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` is overly simplistic and does not consider the full logic required for the problem.
- The division by 2 in `sum(p) // 2` is also not logically sound for the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of Why It's Incorrect
The program fails to correctly determine the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins. It incorrectly adjusts the counts and uses overly simplistic conditions that do not align with the problem's requirements. There are multiple edge cases and scenarios where the program would not produce the correct result.
