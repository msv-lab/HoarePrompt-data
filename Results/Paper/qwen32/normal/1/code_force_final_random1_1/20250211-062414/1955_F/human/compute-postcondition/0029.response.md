The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. This means the previous value of `cnt` (which was the initial value of `cnt` plus the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all `x` in the old `a`) is overwritten by 0.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cnt` is 0.**
