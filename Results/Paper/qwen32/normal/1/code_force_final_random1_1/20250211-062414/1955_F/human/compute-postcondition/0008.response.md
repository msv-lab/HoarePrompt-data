Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `p` is a list of integers, each rounded down to the nearest even number from the new input values.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Lambda Function and Mapping**:
   - `map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])` applies the lambda function to the first three elements of the list `p`.
   - The lambda function checks if each element `x` in `p[:3]` is odd (`x % 2 > 0`). If `x` is odd, it returns `True` (which is equivalent to 1 when summed), otherwise it returns `False` (equivalent to 0).

2. **Summing the Results**:
   - `sum(list(...))` sums up the results of the mapped values.
   - Since each element in `p` is rounded down to the nearest even number, each element in `p` must be even (because rounding down an even number remains even, and rounding down an odd number results in the next lower even number).
   - Therefore, for any element `x` in `p`, `x % 2 > 0` will always be `False` (0).

3. **Condition Check**:
   - `(sum(...) == 3)` checks if the sum of the mapped values is equal to 3.
   - Since all elements in `p` are even, the sum of the mapped values (all 0s) will never be 3. Hence, this condition will always be `False` (which is equivalent to 0 when added).

4. **Sum of List `p` Divided by 2**:
   - `sum(p) // 2` calculates the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2.

5. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression `(sum(...) == 3) + sum(p) // 2` evaluates to `0 + sum(p) // 2` because the condition is always `False`.
   - Thus, the final result is `sum(p) // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the integer division of the sum of all elements in the list `p` by 2.

Output: **sum(p) // 2 (where sum(p) is the sum of all elements in the list `p`)**
