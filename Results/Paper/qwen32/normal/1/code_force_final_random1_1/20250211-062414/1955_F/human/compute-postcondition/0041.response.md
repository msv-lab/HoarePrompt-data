Functionality: **The function accepts four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence respectively. It processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of these four integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the counts provided.**
