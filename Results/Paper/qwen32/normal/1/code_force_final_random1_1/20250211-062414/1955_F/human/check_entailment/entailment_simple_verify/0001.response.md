### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game where they compute the bitwise XOR of a sequence of integers.
- Alice wins if the XOR is non-zero; Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve plays optimally.

#### Key Observations:
1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of two identical numbers is `0`.
   - XOR of a number with `0` is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.
   
2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers is zero.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
   - Eve should aim to make the XOR zero as often as possible by removing numbers strategically.

#### Strategy Breakdown:
- **Odd Counts of 1s and 3s**:
  - If there is an odd count of 1s or 3s, Bob can win when all such numbers are removed, leaving an even count which results in a zero XOR.
- **Even Counts of 1s and 3s**:
  - If there are even counts of 1s and 3s, Bob can win when pairs of these numbers are removed, leaving an even count which results in a zero XOR.
- **Numbers 2 and 4**:
  - These numbers do not affect the parity of the XOR since `2 XOR 2 = 0` and `4 XOR 4 = 0`.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution attempts to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

- **Line 2**: `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`
  - This line converts the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s into even numbers by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2. This operation does not correctly reflect the logic needed for determining Bob's wins.
  
- **Line 3**: `print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)`
  - `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if all three counts (1s, 2s, 3s) are odd. If they are, it adds 1 to the result, indicating that Bob can win once initially.
  - `sum(p) // 2` calculates half the total count of numbers, which does not correctly represent the optimal strategy for maximizing Bob's wins.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The provided solution does not accurately implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Specifically:
- It incorrectly modifies the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
- It does not correctly account for the optimal removal strategy by Eve.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Count the number of 1s and 3s.
2. Determine if the count of 1s and 3s is odd or even.
3. Calculate the number of times Bob can win based on the parity of the counts of 1s and 3s, and the total number of numbers.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p1, p2, p3, p4 = map(int, input().split())
        odd_count = (p1 % 2) + (p3 % 2)
        bob_wins = odd_count // 2 + (p2 + p4) // 2
        if odd_count % 2 == 1:
            bob_wins += 1
        print(bob_wins)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect.

### Final:
Final: **False**
