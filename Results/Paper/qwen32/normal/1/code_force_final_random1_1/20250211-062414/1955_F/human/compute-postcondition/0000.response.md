In the given task, the for loop iterates over the number of test cases, which is determined by the input `t`. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` to ensure that the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer, indicating the number of test cases.
2. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the execution of the loop.
3. To ensure the loop executes, `t` (the number of test cases) must be greater than 0.

Given this, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0. The other variables (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
