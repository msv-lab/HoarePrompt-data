Output State: **`s` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters with `char` inserted at the beginning, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `s`, `unique_chars`, and `j` remain unchanged.
