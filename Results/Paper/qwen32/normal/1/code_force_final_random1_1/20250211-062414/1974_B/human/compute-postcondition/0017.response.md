Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the strings of `s`. If `char` was already in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, and `j` is either `len(unique_chars) - 2` or `len(unique_chars) - 3`. If `char` was not in `unique_chars`, `char` has been inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`, making `unique_chars` still sorted, and `i` is either 1 or 2. `j` is either `len(unique_chars)` or `len(unique_chars) - 1` after the insertion. `char` is the next character in the list `s`.**
