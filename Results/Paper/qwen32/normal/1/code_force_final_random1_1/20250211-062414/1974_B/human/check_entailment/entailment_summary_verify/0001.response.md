### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
The task is to decode a string `b` that was encoded using a specific algorithm:
1. Create an auxiliary string `r` consisting of all distinct characters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
2. Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character from `r`.

To decode, we need to:
1. Identify the distinct characters in `b` and sort them alphabetically to get `r`.
2. For each character in `b`, find its symmetric character in `r` and replace it accordingly to reconstruct the original string `s`.

#### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to decode the string `b` but contains logical errors in the implementation of the decoding process.

#### Issues in the Provided Code
1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The code uses `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` inside the loop, which replaces all occurrences of `char` in `s` at once. This is incorrect because it modifies the string `s` during iteration, leading to incorrect replacements.
2. **Unnecessary Insertion**: The code includes logic to insert characters into `unique_chars` if they are not found, which is unnecessary since `unique_chars` should only contain distinct characters from `b`.
3. **Symmetric Character Mapping**: The code does not correctly map each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`. Instead, it incorrectly modifies the string `s` and `unique_chars` within the loop.

#### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary provided states:
- The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- It processes the string to identify all unique characters present in `s`.
- It returns a single string containing these unique characters sorted in ascending order.

This summary is accurate for the part of the function that identifies and sorts unique characters. However, it does not describe the full intended functionality of decoding the string `b` by mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly decode the string `b`, we need to:
1. Extract the distinct characters from `b` and sort them to form `r`.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
3. Use this mapping to transform `b` back into the original string `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))  # Step 1: Get distinct characters and sort them
    r = unique_chars
    n = len(r)
    mapping = {r[i]: r[n-1-i] for i in range(n)}  # Step 2: Create symmetric mapping
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)  # Step 3: Decode using mapping
    return decoded_str

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
