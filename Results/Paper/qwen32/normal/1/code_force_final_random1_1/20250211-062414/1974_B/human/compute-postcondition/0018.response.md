The only variable in the loop head is `char` from the list `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `s` and how `char` is being used in the loop.

Given:
- `s` is a list of strings.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the strings of `s`.
- `char` is the next character in the list `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `char` has been processed, and now we need to move to the next character in `s` for the next iteration.

Since `char` is the loop variable, it will automatically take the next value from the list `s` in the next iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `s` still contains elements to be processed.

State: **`s` is a list of strings with at least one more character to process, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the strings of `s`, `char` is the next character in the list `s`.**

Note: The state of `unique_chars` and the specific value of `char` do not need to be adjusted directly since they are consequences of the loop's execution rather than inputs to the loop head. The critical part is ensuring that `s` still has characters left to process.
