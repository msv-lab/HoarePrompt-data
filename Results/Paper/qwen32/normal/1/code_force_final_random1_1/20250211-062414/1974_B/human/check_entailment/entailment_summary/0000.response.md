Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. Let's break down why:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task requires decoding an encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The decoding process involves reversing the encoding steps:
   - First, identify the unique characters in `b` and sort them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - Then, replace each character in `b` with its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to perform the decoding.
   - It identifies unique characters in `b` and sorts them to form `r`.
   - However, the replacement logic is flawed. Instead of replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character in `r`, it attempts to replace characters in `b` with characters from `r` in reverse order but does so incorrectly by modifying the string `b` directly within the loop and adjusting the indices in a way that doesn't achieve the desired effect.
   - The code also includes an unnecessary and incorrect part where it inserts characters into `unique_chars` if they are not found, which is not needed for decoding.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify unique characters in `b` and sort them to form `r`.
   - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - Replace each character in `b` using this mapping to get the original string `s`.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly decode the string `b` to obtain the original string `s`.

Correctness: **False**
