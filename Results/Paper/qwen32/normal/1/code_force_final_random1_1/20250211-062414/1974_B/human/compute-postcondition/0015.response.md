The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 0 or 1, after the increment, `i` will be either 1 or 2. The values of `s`, `unique_chars`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters with `char` inserted at index `i`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either `len(unique_chars) - 1` or `len(unique_chars) - 2` before the insertion, and `char` is the next character in the list `s`.**
