### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Construct String `r`:** Create a string `r` consisting of all distinct letters of the encoded string `b`, sorted in alphabetical order.
2. **Decode Process:** For each character in the encoded string `b`, replace it with its symmetric character from the string `r`. Specifically, the first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
- It then calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string `b`.

#### Function `func_1(s)` Analysis:
- **Step 1:** Extract unique characters from `s` and sort them to form `unique_chars`.
- **Step 2:** Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to manage the replacement process.
- **Step 3:** Iterate through each character in `s`:
  - If the character is in `unique_chars`, replace it with the corresponding symmetric character from `unique_chars` (using `j` as the index).
  - If the character is not in `unique_chars`, insert it into `unique_chars` at position `i` and adjust pointers `i` and `j`.

#### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic:** The code attempts to replace characters in `s` directly within the loop, but this approach is flawed because `s` is being modified during iteration, leading to incorrect replacements.
2. **Incorrect Return Value:** The function returns `''.join(unique_chars)`, which is simply the sorted unique characters of the encoded string, not the decoded original string.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Construct `r`:** Extract unique characters from `b` and sort them to form `r`.
2. **Create Mapping:** Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
3. **Decode `b`:** Replace each character in `b` using the mapping to get the original string `s`.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis above, the provided program does not correctly decode the string `b` to obtain the original string `s`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
