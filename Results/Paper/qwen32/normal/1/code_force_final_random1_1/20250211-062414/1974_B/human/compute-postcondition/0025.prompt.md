Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a list of strings, where each string `b` in `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and represents the encoded result of some original string `s`, with the total length of all strings in `s` not exceeding 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the strings of `s`; `i` is 0; `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for char in s:
    if char in unique_chars:
        s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
        j -= 1
    else:
        unique_chars.insert(i, char)
        i += 1
        j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the strings of `s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either `len(unique_chars) - 1` or `len(unique_chars) - 2`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `i` is set to 0, and `j` is decreased by 1. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `char` is inserted at the beginning of `unique_chars`, `i` is set to 1, and `j` is updated to the new length of `unique_chars` minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the strings of `s`. If `char` was already in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, and `j` is either `len(unique_chars) - 2` or `len(unique_chars) - 3`. If `char` was not in `unique_chars`, `char` has been inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`, making `unique_chars` still sorted, and `i` is either 1 or 2. `j` is either `len(unique_chars)` or `len(unique_chars) - 1` after the insertion. `char` is the next character in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a list of strings with at least one more character to process, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the original strings of `s`, `char` is the next character in the list `s`. If `char` was already in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` are replaced with `unique_chars[j]` and `j` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `char` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
