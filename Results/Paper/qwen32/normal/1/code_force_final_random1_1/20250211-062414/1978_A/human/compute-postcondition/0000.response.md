`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
