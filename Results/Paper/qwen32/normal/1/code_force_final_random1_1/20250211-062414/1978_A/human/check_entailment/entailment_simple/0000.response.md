### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by always taking the largest book from the first \( n-1 \) books and adding it to the last book. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

To maximize the total number of pages Alice can read, she should aim to maximize the sum of the highest page count books from both piles. The optimal strategy involves sorting the list of books by their page counts and selecting the two highest values.

The current implementation fails to consider all possible ways to split the books into two non-empty piles and instead makes a greedy choice that may not yield the optimal result.

Let's consider the second test case from the example:

**Input:**
```
4
2 3 3 1
```

**Current Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
The program selects the maximum value from the first three books (which is 3) and adds it to the last book (which is 1), resulting in 4 pages.

**Optimal Output:**
```
6
```

**Explanation:**
The optimal way to divide the books is to put the two books with the highest page counts (3 and 3) into separate piles, allowing Alice to read 3 + 3 = 6 pages.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness:** **False**
