Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). For each test case, the function returns some output based on the provided list of integers.**
