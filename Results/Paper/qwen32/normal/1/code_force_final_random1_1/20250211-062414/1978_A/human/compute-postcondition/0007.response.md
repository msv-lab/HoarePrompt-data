The given code snippet reads a line of input from the user, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `nums`. This means that the value of `nums` changes based on the user's input.

Since `n` is already defined as the number of integers the user will input, and `t` is a predefined integer between 1 and 500, their values remain unchanged. The variable `_` (iteration count) is also not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the updated state will reflect the new value of `nums` based on the user's input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `_` is the current iteration count incremented by 1.**
