The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `nums`. The variables `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `_` is the current iteration count incremented by 1.**
This means that `nums` now holds the list of integers obtained from the user input, while `t` and `_` retain their original values.
