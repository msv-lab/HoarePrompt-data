The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This means the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the input provided. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` between 0 and 99. The variable `a` is mentioned to be greater than 0, but it is not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` must be greater than 0; `x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input.**
