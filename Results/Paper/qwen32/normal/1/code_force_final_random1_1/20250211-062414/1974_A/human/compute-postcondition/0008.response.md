To determine the output of the `print(z)` statement, let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the given initial state:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
   - `a` is greater than 0.
   - `z` is an integer such that 0 ≤ z ≤ 50.
   - `m` is initially calculated as `15 * z - 4 * y`.

2. **Condition Check and Update:**
   - If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to `z + (x + 4 * y + 14 - 15 * z) // 15`.

3. **Final Value of `z`:**
   - The final value of `z` depends on whether the condition `m < a` holds true.
   - If the condition is true, `z` is recalculated; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Let's analyze the update formula:
\[ \text{new\_z} = z + \left\lfloor \frac{x + 4y + 14 - 15z}{15} \right\rfloor \]

Here, the term inside the floor function can be simplified to:
\[ \text{term} = \left\lfloor \frac{x + 4y + 14 - 15z}{15} \right\rfloor \]

This term adjusts `z` based on the values of `x`, `y`, and the current `z`.

### Output Description:
- If `m < a`, `z` is updated using the formula above.
- Otherwise, `z` remains unchanged.

Given the constraints, the exact numerical value of `z` cannot be determined without specific values for `x`, `y`, `z`, and `a`. However, we can describe the final value of `z` based on the conditions provided.

### Final Output:
Output: **z (where z is updated to z + (x + 4 * y + 14 - 15 * z) // 15 if 15 * z - 4 * y < a, otherwise z remains unchanged)**
