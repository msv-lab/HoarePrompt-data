Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `_` is incremented by 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `b1` is `b // 2`.
- `b2` is `b // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. None of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `b1`, `b2`, or `_` are referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
