Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem according to the given requirements and examples.

### Analysis:

The problem requires determining whether a rectangle of dimensions `a x b` can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Even Dimensions:** If both `a` and `b` are even, we can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. For example, a `4x6` rectangle can be cut into two `2x6` rectangles and rearranged into a `4x3` rectangle.
   
2. **Odd Dimensions:** If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's impossible to form a new rectangle because cutting an odd-sized rectangle results in at least one dimension being odd, and rearranging two odd-sized rectangles will not result in a new rectangle with different dimensions.

3. **One Even, One Odd:** If one dimension is even and the other is odd, it's possible to form a new rectangle. For example, a `2x3` rectangle can be cut into two `1x3` rectangles and rearranged into a `2x3` rectangle, but since we can rotate the resulting rectangles, it can be considered as forming a `3x2` rectangle, which is different from `2x3`.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program checks if both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`). If true, it prints 'yes'.
- The program then checks conditions involving `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)`, which seem incorrect and do not align with the logic needed.
- It also checks if `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`. This condition is always true for non-zero `a` and `b`, making it ineffective.
- The `else` block prints 'no', which is not always correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. Specifically, the conditions involving `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are incorrect and the overall logic needs to be simplified and corrected.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
