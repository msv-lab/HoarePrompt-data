### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided code and the annotations against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. He then tries to form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Even Dimensions**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of equal size and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
2. **One Even, One Odd**: If one dimension is even and the other is odd, Bob can also form a new rectangle.
3. **Odd Dimensions**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because the resulting smaller rectangles will not have integer side lengths that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

#### Code Analysis:
Let's break down the logic in the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Condition for Even \(a\) and \(b\)**:
   - `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` is correct. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Odd Dimensions**:
   - `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect. This condition is syntactically incorrect and does not make logical sense in the context of the problem.
   - `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either `0` or `1`, and the condition will always evaluate to `True` for non-zero differences, which is not the intended logic.

3. **Missing Logic**:
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where one dimension is odd and the other is even, or when both dimensions are odd.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, print "Yes".
- If one of \(a\) or \(b\) is odd and the other is even, print "Yes".
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, print "No".

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues in the provided code. The code does not correctly handle the conditions for forming a new rectangle. The corrected approach aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
