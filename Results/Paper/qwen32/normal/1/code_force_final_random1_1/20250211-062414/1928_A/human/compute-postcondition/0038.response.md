The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but since its initial value is not specified, we only note that it changes.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The variables `a` and `b` are reassigned new values from the input, and `_` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `_` is incremented by 1.**
