Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample:

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Conditions:**
   - The condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` seems incorrect and doesn't make logical sense. It appears to be trying to check if `a` and `b` are equal but the syntax is wrong.
   - The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is also incorrect. This condition will always be true for any pair of integers `a` and `b` that are not equal, because the difference between two different integers is never zero.

2. **Missing Correct Logic:**
   - The correct logic should check if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, then the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, then it is impossible to form a new rectangle.

### Correct Logic:
- If `a` is even, cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles.
- If `b` is even, cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it is impossible to form a new rectangle.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the test case `3 3`:
- The current code will incorrectly print 'no' for this case because `(3 - 3) % 2 > 0 or (3 - 3) % 2 < 0` is false, and the previous conditions do not cover this scenario correctly.
- However, according to the problem statement, since both dimensions are odd, it is indeed impossible to form a new rectangle, so 'no' would be the correct output here. But the code's logic is flawed and could fail for other cases.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

func()
```

This implementation correctly checks if either dimension is even, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for forming a new rectangle.
