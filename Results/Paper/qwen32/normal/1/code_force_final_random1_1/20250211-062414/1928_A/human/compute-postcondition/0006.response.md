The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- `a` and `b` are integers, with at least one of them being odd.
- Either `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('no')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **no**
