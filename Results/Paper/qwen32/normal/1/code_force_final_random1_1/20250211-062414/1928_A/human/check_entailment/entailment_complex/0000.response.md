Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
Bob can form another rectangle if:
- He can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles.
- These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is not identical to the original (up to rotation).

### Conditions for Forming Another Rectangle:
1. If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
2. If the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, Bob can also form another rectangle. This is because he can always cut the larger dimension into two parts such that one part is an odd number and the other is the remaining part, allowing for the formation of a new rectangle.

### Analysis of the Code:
Here is the code provided:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect. It seems like an attempt to check if \(a\) and \(b\) are equal, but the syntax is wrong. It should simply be `a == b`.
2. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0 or 1 (or -1), so checking if it is greater than 0 or less than 0 doesn't make sense. Instead, we should check if `(a - b) % 2 != 0` to see if the difference is odd.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a == b:
            print('no')
        elif abs(a - b) % 2 != 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The original code has logical errors and incorrect syntax. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
