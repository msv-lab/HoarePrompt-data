#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it prints 'yes' if either both `a` and `b` are even, or if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.
