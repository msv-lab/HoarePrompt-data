The code assigns `b1` and `b2` the value of `b // 2`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged unless `a` was even and `a1` equaled `b`, which would have caused the program to continue differently. Since there's no else part and no further instructions given, only `b1` and `b2` are updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `_` is incremented by 1; `b1` is `b // 2`; `b2` is `b // 2`.**
