The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The variable `i` is mentioned to be incremented by 1 in the initial state, but the provided code does not affect `i`. Therefore, `i` remains unchanged.

Given that `a` and `b` are read from the input, their new values will be the integers provided in the input. Since the specific input values are not given, we denote them as the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The variables `a` and `b` now hold the integer values read from the input. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1.
