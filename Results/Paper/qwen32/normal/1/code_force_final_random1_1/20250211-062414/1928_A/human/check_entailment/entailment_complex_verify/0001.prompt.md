You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Input

    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it prints 'yes' if either both `a` and `b` are even, or if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:

Bob starts with a rectangle of size `a x b` and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. After cutting, he should be able to rearrange the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one (ignoring rotations).

### Key Observations:

1. **Cutting Possibilities:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle along the length (`a`), he gets two rectangles of size `(a/2) x b`.
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle along the width (`b`), he gets two rectangles of size `a x (b/2)`.

2. **Forming New Rectangles:**
   - To form a new rectangle, the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles must allow them to be rearranged into a rectangle with different dimensions.
   - This means that the total area remains the same (`a * b`), but the dimensions of the new rectangle must be different from `a x b`.

3. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of equal size and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - If either `a` or `b` is odd, Bob can still form a new rectangle unless the difference between `a` and `b` is such that the resulting smaller rectangles cannot be rearranged into a new rectangle with different dimensions.

### Analyzing the Provided Code:

Let's break down the logic in the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Code:

1. **Condition for Even `a` and `b`:**
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` is correct. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Odd Dimensions:**
   - The condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect. This condition seems to be checking something unrelated to the problem requirements.
   - The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either `0` or `1`, and the condition will always evaluate to `True` for non-zero differences, which is not the intended logic.

3. **Missing Logic:**
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where one dimension is odd and the other is even, or when both dimensions are odd.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

- If both `a` and `b` are even, print "Yes".
- If one of `a` or `b` is odd and the other is even, print "Yes".
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, print "No" unless the rectangle can be rearranged in a special way (which is not possible in this problem setup).

Given the above analysis, the provided code is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
