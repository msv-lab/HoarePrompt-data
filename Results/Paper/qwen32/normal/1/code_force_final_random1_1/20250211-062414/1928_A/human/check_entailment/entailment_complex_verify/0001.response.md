### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:

Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. After cutting, he should be able to rearrange the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one (ignoring rotations).

#### Key Observations:

1. **Cutting Possibilities:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle along the length (\(a\)), he gets two rectangles of size \((a/2) \times b\).
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle along the width (\(b\)), he gets two rectangles of size \(a \times (b/2)\).

2. **Forming New Rectangles:**
   - To form a new rectangle, the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles must allow them to be rearranged into a rectangle with different dimensions.
   - This means that the total area remains the same (\(a \times b\)), but the dimensions of the new rectangle must be different from \(a \times b\).

3. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of equal size and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is odd, Bob can still form a new rectangle unless the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is such that the resulting smaller rectangles cannot be rearranged into a new rectangle with different dimensions.

#### Analyzing the Provided Code:

Let's break down the logic in the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Code:

1. **Condition for Even \(a\) and \(b\):**
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` is correct. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Odd Dimensions:**
   - The condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect. This condition seems to be checking something unrelated to the problem requirements. It evaluates to a tuple and is not meaningful in this context.
   - The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either `0` or `1`, and the condition will always evaluate to `True` for non-zero differences, which is not the intended logic.

3. **Missing Logic:**
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where one dimension is odd and the other is even, or when both dimensions are odd.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, print "Yes".
- If one of \(a\) or \(b\) is odd and the other is even, print "Yes".
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, print "No" unless the rectangle can be rearranged in a special way (which is not possible in this problem setup).

Given the above analysis, the provided code is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
