Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If one of them is even, it further checks if splitting the even number into two equal parts results in a part that is not equal to the other number. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it directly prints 'No'.**
