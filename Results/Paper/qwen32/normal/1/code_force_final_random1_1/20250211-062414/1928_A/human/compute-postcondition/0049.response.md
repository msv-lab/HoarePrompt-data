Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- If `b` is even:
  - `b1` is set to `b // 2`.
  - `b2` is set to `b // 2`.
  - If `b1` is not equal to `a`, there are no further changes.
- If `b` is odd, there are no changes to `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, or `_`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('No')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `b1`, `b2`, or `_`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Conclusion:
Regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `b1`, `b2`, or `_`, the `print('No')` statement will always output the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
