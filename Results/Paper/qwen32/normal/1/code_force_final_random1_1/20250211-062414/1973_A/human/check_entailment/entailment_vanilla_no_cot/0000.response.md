Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Total Matches**: The condition `if total_matchs > 3` is incorrect. There is no inherent limit of 3 matches in the problem statement. The number of matches can be more than 3 depending on the scores.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws (`egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`) does not correctly account for the possible scenarios of wins and draws leading to the given scores.

3. **Test Case Error**: The third test case `(0, 2, 3)` in the `cas_de_test` list should be `(1, 1, 1)` according to the problem statement.

Let's correct these issues:

- We need to ensure that the total points are even, as each match contributes either 2 points (win/loss) or 2 points (draw).
- We need to check if the scores are achievable with a combination of wins and draws.
- We need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are valid.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible draws
        max_draws = min(p3 - p2, p2 - p1, total_points // 2 - (p3 - p1))
        
        # Check if the scores are achievable with the calculated draws
        remaining_points_after_draws = total_points - 2 * max_draws
        if remaining_points_after_draws == 2 * (p3 - p1):
            resultats.append(max_draws)
        else:
            resultats.append(-1)
    
    return resultats

# Test the corrected function
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))
```

This corrected function should produce the expected output for the given test cases.
