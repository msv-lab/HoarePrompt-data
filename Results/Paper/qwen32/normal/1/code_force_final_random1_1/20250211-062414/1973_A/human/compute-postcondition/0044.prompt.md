Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players in non-decreasing order for each test case; `resultats` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p1, p2, p3 in cas_de_test:
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    total_matchs = total_points // 2
    if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
    if egalites < 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
    else:
        resultats.append(egalites // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple. `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` and is odd. `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)` where `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in `cas_de_test`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` is a list containing the elements [-1, -1] if `total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is true, otherwise `resultats` is a list containing the element [-1], and an additional element `-1` is appended to `resultats`. If `egalites` is greater than or equal to 0, `resultats` is a list containing the elements [-1, -1, egalites // 2] if `total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is true, otherwise `resultats` is a list containing the element [-1, egalites // 2].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples, `total_points` is the sum of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` now includes `-1` at the end. Additionally, if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, the same conditions and variable states hold as described. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` now includes `-1` at the end. Otherwise, `resultats` now includes `egalites // 2` at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples, `total_points` is the sum of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` includes an additional element `-1`. If `total_matchs` > 3 or `p3` > `total_matchs`, `resultats` includes an additional element `-1`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` includes an extra `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` includes an additional element `egalites // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
