Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements:

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Total Points**: The sum of points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (if there's a winner) or 2 points (if it's a draw).
2. **Maximum Matches**: The total number of matches played cannot exceed 3, since there are only 3 players and each match involves 2 players.
3. **Individual Player Scores**: No player can have more points than the total number of matches played.
4. **Draw Calculation**: The maximum number of draws is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{draws} = \frac{\text{total\_points} - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p2}) - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p1})}{2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that the points are distributed correctly among wins and draws.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Total Points Check**: The code correctly checks if the total points are even.
2. **Total Matches Check**: The code calculates the total number of matches as `total_points // 2`. It then checks if this exceeds 3 or if `p3` exceeds the total number of matches. These checks ensure that the scores are feasible.
3. **Draw Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws is correct:
   \[
   \text{egalites} = \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p2}) - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p1})
   \]
   If the calculated number of draws (`egalites`) is negative, it means the scores are inconsistent, and the code correctly appends `-1` to the results.
4. **Appending Results**: The code correctly appends the calculated number of draws (or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent) to the results list.

### Testing the Code Against the Examples:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `(0, 0, 0)`
  - Total Points: 0 (even)
  - Total Matches: 0
  - Draws: 0
  - Result: 0 (correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `(0, 1, 1)`
  - Total Points: 2 (even)
  - Total Matches: 1
  - Draws: 1
  - Result: 1 (correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `(1, 1, 1)`
  - Total Points: 3 (odd)
  - Result: -1 (correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `(1, 1, 2)`
  - Total Points: 4 (even)
  - Total Matches: 2
  - Draws: 2
  - Result: 2 (correct)

- **Test Case 5**: `(3, 3, 3)`
  - Total Points: 9 (odd)
  - Result: -1 (correct)

- **Test Case 6**: `(3, 4, 5)`
  - Total Points: 12 (even)
  - Total Matches: 6 (exceeds 3)
  - Result: -1 (correct)

- **Test Case 7**: `(1, 1, 10)`
  - Total Points: 12 (even)
  - Total Matches: 6 (exceeds 3)
  - Result: -1 (correct)

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws or identify inconsistent scores. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
