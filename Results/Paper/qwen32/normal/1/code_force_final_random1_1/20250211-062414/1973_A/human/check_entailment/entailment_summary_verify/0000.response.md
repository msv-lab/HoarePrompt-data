### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The total points from all games is calculated as `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - Since each game awards either 2 points (win/loss) or 2 points (draw), `total_points` must be even. If not, the scores are inconsistent, and the function should return `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The total number of matches played is `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - The maximum number of matches that could have been played among three players is not necessarily 3. Instead, it depends on the scores and how they can be distributed among the players. The condition `total_matchs > 3` is too restrictive and incorrect.

3. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the difference in points between the highest and second-highest scores (`p3 - p2`) and between the highest and lowest scores (`p3 - p1`) must account for the wins and losses, leaving the remaining points as draws.
   - If `egalites` is negative, it means the calculated number of draws is invalid, and the function should return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the number of draws is `egalites // 2`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `total_matchs > 3` is incorrect. The maximum number of matches is not limited to 3 but depends on the scores.
- The condition `p3 > total_matchs` is also incorrect. The highest score `p3` can be equal to `total_matchs` if all games resulted in wins and losses.

#### Corrected Analysis:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Examples:
- **Input**: `(0, 0, 0)` -> **Output**: `0` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(0, 1, 1)` -> **Output**: `1` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(0, 2, 3)` -> **Output**: `-1` (Incorrect, should be `1`)
- **Input**: `(3, 3, 3)` -> **Output**: `-1` (Incorrect, should be `3`)
- **Input**: `(3, 4, 5)` -> **Output**: `6` (Incorrect, should be `3`)
- **Input**: `(1, 1, 10)` -> **Output**: `2` (Incorrect, should be `-1`)
- **Input**: `(0, 0, 6)` -> **Output**: `-1` (Incorrect, should be `3`)

#### Additional Edge Cases:
- **Input**: `(0, 0, 2)` -> **Output**: `1` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(1, 2, 3)` -> **Output**: `2` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(2, 2, 2)` -> **Output**: `3` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(0, 0, 4)` -> **Output**: `2` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(0, 3, 3)` -> **Output**: `-1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program fails several test cases and does not correctly handle all scenarios. Specifically, it incorrectly calculates the number of draws for certain inputs and does not properly validate all conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the number of draws for several inputs and does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it fails to correctly compute the number of draws for inputs like `(0, 2, 3)`, `(3, 3, 3)`, `(3, 4, 5)`, `(1, 1, 10)`, and `(0, 0, 6)`. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.

Final: **False**
