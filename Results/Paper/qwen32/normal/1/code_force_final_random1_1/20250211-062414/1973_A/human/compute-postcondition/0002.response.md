The code snippet calculates the sum of the three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the first tuple in the `cas_de_test` list and assigns this sum to the variable `total_points`. However, the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not defined in the given initial state. We can infer that these variables should be extracted from the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.

Let's assume the first tuple in `cas_de_test` is `(p_1, p_2, p_3)`. Then `total_points` will be `p_1 + p_2 + p_3`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, and `resultats` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `total_points`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple, `resultats` is an empty list, `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` (i.e., `total_points = cas_de_test[0][0] + cas_de_test[0][1] + cas_de_test[0][2]`).**
