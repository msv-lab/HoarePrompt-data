Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples, `total_points` is the sum of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` divided by 2, `egalites` is 3 times the difference between the sum of the first two elements and the third element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `resultats` now includes `-1` at the end.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop structure provided in the context, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or their values. Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
