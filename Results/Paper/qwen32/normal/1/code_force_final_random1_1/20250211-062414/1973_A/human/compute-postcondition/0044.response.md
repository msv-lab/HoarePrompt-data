To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the given loop and the initial state. The loop iterates over each tuple in the `cas_de_test` list, calculates certain values based on the scores of the three players, and appends the results to the `resultats` list according to specific conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the loop processes each tuple and what it appends to the `resultats` list:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers representing the scores of the three players in non-decreasing order.
   - `resultats` is an initially empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`:
     - Calculate `total_points` as the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
     - If `total_points` is odd, append `-1` to `resultats` and continue to the next tuple.
     - Calculate `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`.
     - If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, append `-1` to `resultats` and continue to the next tuple.
     - Calculate `egalites` as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
     - If `egalites` is less than 0, append `-1` to `resultats`.
     - Otherwise, append `egalites // 2` to `resultats`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After processing all tuples in `cas_de_test`, the `resultats` list will contain the results of each iteration based on the conditions above.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.
   - The `cas_de_test` list remains unchanged.

Given the initial state and the loop logic, the final output state will be:

- `t` remains the same as the initial value.
- `cas_de_test` remains the same as the initial list of tuples.
- `resultats` will contain the results of each iteration, which are either `-1` or a calculated value based on the conditions.

Since the exact values of `t` and `cas_de_test` are not provided, we can't specify the exact contents of `resultats`. However, we can describe the final state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `resultats` is a list containing the results of each iteration based on the conditions specified in the loop.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that `t` and `cas_de_test` remain unchanged, while `resultats` contains the computed results for each tuple in `cas_de_test` according to the loop's logic.
