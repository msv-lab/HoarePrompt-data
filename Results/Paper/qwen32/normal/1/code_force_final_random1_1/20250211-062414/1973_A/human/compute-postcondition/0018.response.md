The only variables in the loop head are `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, which are unpacked from the tuples in the list `cas_de_test`. To prepare for the next iteration of the loop, we need to move to the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple.
- `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` and is odd.
- `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.
- `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)` where `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and `p3`.

For the next iteration, we need to adjust `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to the values of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`. The other variables (`t`, `cas_de_test`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, `egalites`, and `resultats`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Let's assume that the current tuple being processed is the first one, and there is at least another tuple in `cas_de_test`. Therefore, the next tuple will be the second one in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples, `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` and is odd, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)` where `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and `p3`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the values of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`**.
