### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure it correctly determines the maximum number of draws or if the given scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games.

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The total points across all players is calculated as `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - Since each game awards either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw), the total points must be even. If not, it's impossible to have achieved those scores through valid games, and the program correctly appends `-1` to the results.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The total number of matches played is `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - The maximum number of matches possible among three players is 3 (since each match involves two players, and we can have at most 3 unique pairs among three players). If `total_matchs` exceeds 3, it means more than 3 matches were played, which is impossible, and the program correctly appends `-1` to the results.
   - Additionally, if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`, it implies that one player has more points than the total number of matches played, which is impossible, and the program correctly appends `-1` to the results.

3. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
     - `2 * (p3 - p2)` accounts for the points that must have come from wins/losses between the highest and second-highest scoring players.
     - `2 * (p3 - p1)` accounts for the points that must have come from wins/losses between the highest and lowest scoring players.
     - Subtracting these from `total_points` gives the points that could have come from draws.
   - If `egalites` is negative, it means the calculated points from draws are less than zero, which is impossible, and the program correctly appends `-1` to the results.
   - Otherwise, the number of draws is `egalites // 2`.

### Testing the Program with Given Examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `(0, 0, 0)`
  - `total_points = 0`, `total_matchs = 0`, `egalites = 0`
  - Result: `0` (correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `(0, 1, 1)`
  - `total_points = 2`, `total_matchs = 1`, `egalites = 2 - 2*(1-1) - 2*(1-0) = 0`
  - Result: `1` (correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `(0, 2, 3)`
  - `total_points = 5` (odd), so the result should be `-1` (correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `(3, 3, 3)`
  - `total_points = 9` (odd), so the result should be `-1` (correct)

- **Test Case 5**: `(3, 4, 5)`
  - `total_points = 12`, `total_matchs = 6` (exceeds 3), so the result should be `-1` (correct)

- **Test Case 6**: `(1, 1, 10)`
  - `total_points = 12`, `total_matchs = 6`, `egalites = 12 - 2*(10-1) - 2*(10-1) = -12`
  - Result: `-1` (correct)

- **Test Case 7**: `(0, 0, 6)`
  - `total_points = 6`, `total_matchs = 3`, `egalites = 6 - 2*(6-0) - 2*(6-0) = -12`
  - Result: `-1` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the edge cases and calculates the maximum number of draws or identifies invalid score combinations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
