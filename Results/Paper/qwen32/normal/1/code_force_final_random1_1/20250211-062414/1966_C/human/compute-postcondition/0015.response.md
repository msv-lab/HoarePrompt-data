To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop. The loop condition is `tc > 0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` is now `tc - 1` (must still be greater than 0).
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`.
- `dp` is the result of the final evaluation of the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

Since `tc` is now `tc - 1` but must still be greater than 0, we need to ensure that before decrementing `tc`, it was at least 2. This way, after decrementing, it will still be greater than 0 and the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted such that `tc` is at least 2 before the decrement operation.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` must be at least 2, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`, `dp` is the result of the final evaluation of the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`**.
