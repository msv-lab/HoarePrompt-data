Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on a specific condition related to the differences between consecutive unique, sorted integers in the list. It outputs "Alice" if the condition is met for all consecutive pairs, otherwise it outputs "Bob".**
