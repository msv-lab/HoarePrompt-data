The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `x`. This means the initial value of `x` (which was a list of integers representing the initial positions of `n` monsters) is overwritten by the new list of integers read from the input.

Given the initial state, `a` remains unchanged as it is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `k` and `t` also remain unchanged as they are integer values read from the input.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` is the integer value read from the input, and `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
