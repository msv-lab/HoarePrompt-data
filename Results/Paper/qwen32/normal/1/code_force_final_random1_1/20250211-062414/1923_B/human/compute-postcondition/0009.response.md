The given code snippet reassigns the variable `x` to a new list of integers read from the input. This means the original value of `x` is overwritten.

Given the Initial State:
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `x` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input.
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, decremented by 1 from its previous value.

After executing the code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))`, the variable `x` will now hold the new list of integers read from the input, replacing its previous value.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `x` is a new list of integers read from the input; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, decremented by 1 from its previous value.**
