To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state provided:

### Initial State Recap:
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input.
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement evaluates the return value of the function `func_1(a, x, k)`. If the function returns a truthy value, it prints `'YES'`; otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.

However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided initial state. Without knowing the implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact return value of `func_1(a, x, k)`. Therefore, we can only describe the output based on the possible outcomes of the function call.

### Conclusion:
Given that the behavior of `func_1(a, x, k)` is unknown, the output will depend on whether this function returns a truthy or falsy value.

Output: **'YES' if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns a truthy value, otherwise 'NO'**
