Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`; `x` is 1; `k` is `n`; `sorted_indices`, `pos` is `len(sorted_indices) - 1` or `len(sorted_indices)` depending on the initial value of `pos`; `distance` is incremented by 1; `rest` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `delta`; `delta` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.**

Explanation: The value of `pos` is incremented by 1. If `pos` was initially `len(sorted_indices) - 2`, it becomes `len(sorted_indices) - 1`. If `pos` was initially `len(sorted_indices) - 1`, it becomes `len(sorted_indices)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
