Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters after all possible shots have been fired; `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged; `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`; `distance` is incremented by 1; `rest` is `k`. If the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `distance`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return and continues execution.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters after all possible shots have been fired, with `a[sorted_indices[0]]` reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` (which is `a[sorted_indices[0]]` initially) is 0, then `pos` is set to 1; otherwise, `pos` remains 0. `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged; `distance` is incremented by 1; `rest` is `k - delta`; `delta` is `min(k, a[sorted_indices[0]])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters. `a[sorted_indices[0]]` is reduced by `delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged. `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `distance` is incremented by 1. `rest` is `k - 2*delta`. `delta` is `min(k - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters, `a[sorted_indices[0]]` is reduced by `delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged. `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `distance` is incremented by 1. `rest` is `k - 2*delta - delta` where `k - 3*delta > 0`. `delta` is `min(k - 2*delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
