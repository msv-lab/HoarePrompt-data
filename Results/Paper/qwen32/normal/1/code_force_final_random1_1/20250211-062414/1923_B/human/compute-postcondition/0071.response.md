Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters. `a[sorted_indices[0]]` is reduced by `delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged. `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `distance` is incremented by 1. `rest` is `k - 2*delta`. `delta` is `min(k - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**
