Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`. `x` is 1. `k` is `n`. `sorted_indices`, `pos` is `len(sorted_indices) - 1` or `len(sorted_indices)` depending on the initial value of `pos`. `distance` is incremented by 1. `rest` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `delta`. `delta` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was initially 0, the value of `pos` remains unchanged.**
