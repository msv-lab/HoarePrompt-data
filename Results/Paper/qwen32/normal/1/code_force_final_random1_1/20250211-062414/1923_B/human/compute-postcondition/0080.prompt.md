Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of monsters such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i, and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `sorted_indices` is a list of indices of `x` sorted by the absolute values of `x[i]`; `distance` is 0; `pos` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while pos != len(sorted_indices):
    if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
        return False
    rest = k
    while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
        delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
        rest -= delta
        a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
        if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
            pos += 1
    distance += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters after all possible shots have been fired; `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `pos`, and `rest` remain unchanged; `distance` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters after all possible shots have been fired; `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged; `pos` is `len(sorted_indices)`; `distance` is incremented by 1; `rest` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters after all possible shots have been fired; `pos` is the index of the first monster that has not been fully targeted or the length of `sorted_indices` if all monsters have been targeted; `rest` is the remaining number of shots, which could be 0 or some positive number if not all shots were needed; `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged; `distance` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
