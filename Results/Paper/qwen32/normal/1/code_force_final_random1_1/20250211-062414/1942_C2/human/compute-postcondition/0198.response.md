Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of iterations where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`, plus the sum of all `gaps` in `odd`, plus `gap` plus the next `gap` in `even`, plus `gap`; `odd`, `i`, `next_elem`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `st`, `even` retain their original values; `gap` remains the next element in `even` (i.e., `even[j+1]`).**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is increased by the current value of `gap`. All other variables retain their original values.
