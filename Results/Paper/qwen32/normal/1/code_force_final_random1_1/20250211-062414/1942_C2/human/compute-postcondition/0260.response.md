Postcondition: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is incremented by `2 * y` if `y < gap // 2`. `odd` contains at least one odd gap greater than 1 and is sorted, `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted, `gap` is the first element in `odd`. If `y < gap // 2`, `y` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
