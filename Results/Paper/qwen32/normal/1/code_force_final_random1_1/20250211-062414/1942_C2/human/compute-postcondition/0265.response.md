The code snippet assigns `0` to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `ans`, `odd`, `even`, or `gap`. Therefore, the only change is that `y` is now `0`.

Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is incremented by `gap` and then by `2 * y`, `odd` contains at least one odd gap greater than 1 and is sorted, `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `y` is 0**.
