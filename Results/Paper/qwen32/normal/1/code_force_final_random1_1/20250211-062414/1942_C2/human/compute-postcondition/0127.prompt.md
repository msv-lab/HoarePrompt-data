Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]
        ) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input with `y` potentially decremented; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `ans` is adjusted based on the loop conditions plus `y`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` was incremented by 1. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, and `y` was greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` includes `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` and `tmp` contains the half-differences of consecutive elements that met the second condition, plus the new value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. Additionally, `y` was decremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. `ans` is now `ans + y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: tt must be greater than 0; n, x, and y are integers obtained from the input; a is a sorted list of integers with len(a) > 1; ii is incremented by 1; tmp is a list containing all applicable half-differences. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then ans is the sum of x + y - 2 plus the increments due to differences of 2 and applicable even differences plus 1. Otherwise, if the sum of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` and `tmp` includes `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and ans is the sum of x + y - 2 plus the increments due to differences of 2 and applicable even differences plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged and `tmp` does not include `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`; `ans` is increased by `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` remains greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input, with `y` potentially reduced; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ii` is incremented by 2; `tmp` contains all valid `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` values; `ans` is adjusted based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and now `ans` is incremented by `y`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `tmp` includes the new value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` and `ans` includes this additional value, and `y` is reduced by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
