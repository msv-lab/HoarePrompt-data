Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of iterations where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`, plus the sum of all `gaps` in `odd`, plus `gap` plus the next `gap` in `even` plus `2 * y`; `odd`, `i`, `next_elem`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `st`, `even` retain their original values; `gap` is the next element in `even` (i.e., `even[j+1]`); `y` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
