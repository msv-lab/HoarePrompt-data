Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input with `y` potentially decremented; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `ans` is adjusted based on the loop conditions; `tmp` contains half-differences of consecutive elements that met the second condition; the sum of the first element of `a` plus `n` minus the last element of `a` is even and not equal to 2; `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**
