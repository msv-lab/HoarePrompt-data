Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `x` is at least 1, `n` and `y` are the values returned by `R()`, `l` is a sorted list returned by `R()` with at least two elements (including the additional element `n + l[0]` appended), `val` is a non-empty sorted list of `x` elements where each element is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x` (sorted first by evenness and then by value). If `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is the original count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 plus `y * 2`, and `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`. Additionally, `c` is `i // 2`. If `y` is not less than `c`, the values of `sx` and `cons` remain unchanged.**
