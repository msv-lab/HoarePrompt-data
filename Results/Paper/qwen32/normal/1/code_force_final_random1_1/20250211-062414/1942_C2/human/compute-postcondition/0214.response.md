Postcondition: **`ans` is `x - 1` if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x - 2`. `y` is updated to the value read from the input, `t` is decremented by 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `st` is a set of the elements in the list `a`, and `even`, `odd`, `i`, `next_elem`, `n`, `x`, `t1`, and `t2` retain their original values except as specified.**
