The code appends the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers and `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, the value being appended is half the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `len(a) > 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**
