The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `even`, `gap`, or `ans`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same for `even`, `gap`, and `ans` except for `y`.

Output State: **`even` contains at least one even number greater than 0 and is sorted; `gap` is the next value in the list `even` after the current `gap`; `ans` is increased by `2 * y`; `y` is 0.**
