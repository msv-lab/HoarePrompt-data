The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by `2 * y`. The values of `i`, `odd`, `even`, and `gap` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the given code snippet.

Given that `ans` was initially incremented by `gap`, and now it is further incremented by `2 * y`, the new value of `ans` would be its previous value plus `2 * y`.

Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is incremented by `gap` and then by `2 * y`, `odd` contains at least one odd gap greater than 1 and is sorted, `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted, `gap` is the next element in `odd`**.
