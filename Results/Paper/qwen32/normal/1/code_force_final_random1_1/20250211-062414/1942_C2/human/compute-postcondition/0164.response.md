The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` increases the value of `ans` by `2 * y`. The value of `y` is not modified by this operation, but `ans` is updated accordingly.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of iterations where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`, plus `gap`. If `y < gap // 2`, `ans` is further increased by `2 * y` and `y` is set to 0.
- `odd` contains at least one gap greater than 1 and odd.
- `even` contains all gaps greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order.
- `i` is `x - 1`.
- `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
- `gap` is the next element in `odd`.
- `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `st` retain their original values.
- `y` is `original_y - gap // 2`.

After executing `ans += 2 * y`, the new value of `ans` will be the original value of `ans` plus `2 * y`.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of iterations where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`, plus `gap`, plus `2 * (original_y - gap // 2)`; `odd` contains at least one gap greater than 1 and odd; `even` contains all gaps greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order; `i` is `x - 1`; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`; `gap` is the next element in `odd`; `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `st` retain their original values; `y` is `original_y - gap // 2`.**
