The code snippet provided resets the list `tmp` to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ii` is incremented by 2; `tmp` is an empty list; `ans` is `x + y - 2`.**
