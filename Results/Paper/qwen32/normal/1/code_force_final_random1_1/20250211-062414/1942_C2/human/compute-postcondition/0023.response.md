Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to its previous value.**
