Precondition: **s is an integer representing a starting vertex in the tree (1 <= s <= n), n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3), and u2vs is a dictionary or list of lists where u2vs[u] contains all vertices v directly connected to vertex u by an edge.**
