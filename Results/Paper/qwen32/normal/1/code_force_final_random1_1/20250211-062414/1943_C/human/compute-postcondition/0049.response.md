To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `ci`.

Given:
- `path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd.
- `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, 0)`.
- `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
- `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
- `i` is 0.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(ci + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine `ci`:**
   - Since the length of `path_ba` is odd, let's denote the length of `path_ba` as `L`.
   - Therefore, `ci = L // 2`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `i` needs to be adjusted from 0 to 1.
- No other variables in the loop head (`ci`) need to be adjusted because they are derived from the properties of `path_ba` and do not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, 0)`; `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`; `i` is 1.**
