To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i`.

Here's the given information:
- The loop runs as `for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`, and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the current value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.

2. **Understand the loop range:**
   - The loop starts at 1 and goes up to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` should be `1 + 2 = 3`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - Only `i` needs to be adjusted because it's the only variable in the loop head.
   - The other variables (`path_ba`, `ops`, `c2`, `c1`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1` and having a length greater than 2 and even; `ops` is a list containing two elements `[(c2 - 1, 1), (c2, 1)]`; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 3**.
