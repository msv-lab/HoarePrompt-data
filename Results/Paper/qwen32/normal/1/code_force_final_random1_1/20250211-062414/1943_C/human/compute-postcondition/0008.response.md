In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. The loop runs `n - 1` times. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to consider the loop counter.

Given:
- The loop runs `n - 1` times.
- The loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, so it does not affect the state.

Since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state, the only thing that needs adjustment is the implicit loop counter, which is managed internally by Python's `range` function. However, since we are only concerned with the state of variables mentioned in the loop head, and there are no such variables here, the state remains unchanged except for the implicit progress of the loop.

Let's break down the iterations:
- Initially, the loop would run from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive).
- After each iteration, the internal counter increases by 1.

Therefore, if we are at the end of the previous iteration, the loop counter would have just completed an iteration and is about to start the next one. Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state, the state of `u2vs` remains the same.

State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where the list at index `u` contains `v`, and the list at index `v` additionally contains `u`.**
