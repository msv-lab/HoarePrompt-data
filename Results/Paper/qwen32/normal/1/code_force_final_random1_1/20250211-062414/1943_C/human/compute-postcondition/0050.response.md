The code appends a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` is 1. Therefore, the new tuple added to `ops` will be `(c, 1)`. The values of `path_ba`, `ci`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`; `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`; `i` is 1.**
