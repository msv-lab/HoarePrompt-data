Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `u2vs`, which is a list of lists containing integers representing the neighbors of each vertex in a tree, and `n`, which is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. The tree is represented such that vertices are 0-indexed. The function does not perform any operations and simply returns `None`.**
