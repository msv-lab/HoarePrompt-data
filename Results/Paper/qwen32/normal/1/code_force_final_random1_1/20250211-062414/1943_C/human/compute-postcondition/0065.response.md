The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `i` is 5. Since `path_ba` has a length greater than 8 and even, `c2` must be an integer greater than 4. The new tuple added to `ops` will be `(c2, 5)`.

Therefore, the updated `ops` list will now contain six elements: `[(c2 - 1, 1), (c2, 1), (c2 - 1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2 - 1, 5), (c2, 5)]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1` and having a length greater than 8 and even; `ops` is a list containing six elements `[(c2 - 1, 1), (c2, 1), (c2 - 1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2 - 1, 5), (c2, 5)]`; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 5**.
