To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the range function parameters: `start=1`, `stop=len(path_ba) - c1`, and `step=2`.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Start Value (`start=1`)**: The loop starts at `i = 1`.
2. **Stop Value (`stop=len(path_ba) - c1`)**: The loop stops when `i` reaches this value.
3. **Step Value (`step=2`)**: The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration.

For the loop to execute at least once, the `start` value must be less than the `stop` value. Therefore, `1 < len(path_ba) - c1` must hold true.

Given the initial conditions:
- `len(path_ba)` is even.
- `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, so `c2 = len(path_ba) / 2`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`, so `c1 = (len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`.

Let's substitute `c1` into the inequality:
\[ 1 < len(path_ba) - \left(\frac{len(path_ba)}{2} - 1\right) \]
\[ 1 < len(path_ba) - \frac{len(path_ba)}{2} + 1 \]
\[ 1 < \frac{len(path_ba)}{2} + 1 \]
\[ 0 < \frac{len(path_ba)}{2} \]
\[ 0 < len(path_ba) \]

Since `len(path_ba)` is already given to be even and positive, the inequality holds true as long as `len(path_ba) > 2`. This is because if `len(path_ba) = 2`, then `c1 = 0` and the stop value becomes `2 - 0 = 2`, making the loop condition `1 < 2` true but resulting in no iterations since the range would be `range(1, 2, 2)` which is empty.

Therefore, the minimum length of `path_ba` for the loop to execute at least once is 4 (since it must be even and greater than 2).

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `path_ba` must have a length greater than 2 and must be even.
- `c2` should be half the length of `path_ba`.
- `c1` should be `c2 - 1`.
- `i` starts at 1, and the loop will execute as long as the length of `path_ba` is sufficient.

State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1` and having a length greater than 2 and even; `ops` is an empty list; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 1**
