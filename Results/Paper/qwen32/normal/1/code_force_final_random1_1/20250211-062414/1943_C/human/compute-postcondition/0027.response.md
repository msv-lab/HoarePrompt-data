The code snippet assigns the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to the variable `n`. Given that `path_ba` is a list containing a single element `b`, `path_ba[-1]` refers to `b`. Therefore, `n` is updated to the value of `previous[b]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `u2vs` remains a list containing `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices (as indices) that are directly connected to vertex `i`.
- `d` remains a list where `d[0]` is `0` and `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `0` to vertex `i` for all other vertices `i`, calculated using the doubled values in `a`.
- `previous` remains a list containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex `i`.
- `b` remains the return value of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` remains a list containing the single element `b`.
- `n` is now the value of `previous[b]`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices (as indices) that are directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list where `d[0]` is `0` and `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `0` to vertex `i` for all other vertices `i`, calculated using the doubled values in `a`; `previous` is a list containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex `i`; `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`; `n` is `previous[b]`.**
