#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input to construct an adjacency list representation of a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges. It then determines the longest path in the tree, finds its midpoint(s), and generates a specific set of operations based on whether the path length is odd or even. Finally, it prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, each operation consisting of a vertex index and a distance value. The function does not modify the input data and returns `None`.
