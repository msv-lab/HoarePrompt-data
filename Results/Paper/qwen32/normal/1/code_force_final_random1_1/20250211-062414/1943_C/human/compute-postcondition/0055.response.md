The code calculates the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and assigns it to `c2`. Since the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` will be an integer representing half the length of `path_ba`.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1`; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.**
