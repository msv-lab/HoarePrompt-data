Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices (as indices) that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree. Each connection is represented exactly once in both directions.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `u2vs` will represent the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices. Each entry in `u2vs` will contain a list of vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex. For example, if vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1 and 2, then `u2vs[0]` will be `[1, 2]`, and similarly, `u2vs[1]` will include `0`, and `u2vs[2]` will also include `0`. Each edge between two vertices will be represented exactly once in both vertices' adjacency lists.
