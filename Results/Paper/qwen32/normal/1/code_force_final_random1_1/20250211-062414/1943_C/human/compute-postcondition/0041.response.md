The code snippet appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Given the initial state, `path_ba` initially contains the elements `[b, n, n]`. After appending `n` again, `path_ba` will now contain `[b, n, n, n]`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices (as indices) that are directly connected to vertex `i`. `d` is a list where `d[0]` is `0` and `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `0` to vertex `i` for all other vertices `i`, calculated using the doubled values in `a`. `previous` is a list containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex `i`. `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, n, n, n]`. If `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
