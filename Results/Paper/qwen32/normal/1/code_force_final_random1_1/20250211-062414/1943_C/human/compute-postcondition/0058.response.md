The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c1` is `c2 - 1` and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `i` is 1, the tuple added to `ops` will be `(c2 - 1, 1)`. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1` and having a length greater than 2 and even; `ops` is a list containing one element `(c2 - 1, 1)`; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 1.**
