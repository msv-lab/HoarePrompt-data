The code appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. Given the initial state, the list at index `v` already contains `u` (and possibly other elements). After the operation, the list at index `v` will have `u` appended to it again.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where the list at index `u` contains `v`, and the list at index `v` contains `u` at least twice; `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input with `u` decreased by 1 and `v` decreased by 1.**
