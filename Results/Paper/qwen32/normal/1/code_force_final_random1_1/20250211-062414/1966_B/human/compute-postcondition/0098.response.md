To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables over time.

Here's a breakdown of the loop and its effects:
- The loop runs `n` times, as indicated by `for i in range(n)`.
- In each iteration, an input string is appended to the list `gr`.
- The variable `i` takes on the values from `0` to `n-1` during the loop iterations.
- The variable `j` retains its previous value and is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `tc` is incremented by 1, but since this increment is not tied to the loop iterations in the provided description, we'll assume it increments once per loop iteration, making it `tc = tc + n` after the loop completes.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, after the loop completes all `n` iterations, the state will be:
- `t` remains the same as the initial state.
- `n` remains the same as the initial state.
- `m` remains the same as the initial state.
- `gr` will contain `n` elements, each being an input string appended in each iteration.
- `i` will be `n-1` after the last iteration, but since the loop ends and `i` is not used afterward, its final value in the context of the loop completion is irrelevant.
- `j` retains its previous value.
- `tc` will be incremented by `n` (assuming it was incremented once per loop iteration).

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by `n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `gr` will have `n` strings, and `tc` will have increased by `n` from its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged or retain their previous values.
