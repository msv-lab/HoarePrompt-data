Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string), `i` is 0, `j` is `m-2`, `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)`, `ans` is 'YES' if the first character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, or the `m-1`-th character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the `m-1`-th character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'NO'. The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, and `impossible` is False if the first character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, or the `m-1`-th character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the `m-1`-th character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
