To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it depends on `m`. Therefore, the state of `m` is crucial for determining if the loop can execute.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `m - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `m` must be at least 2.
- The initial value of `j` is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition since `j` is initialized by the `range` function in each iteration. However, `j` retains its previous value outside the loop, which doesn't affect the loop's execution condition.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `m` is at least 2 to allow the loop to execute.
- Other variables (`t`, `n`, `gr`, `i`, `tc`, `ans`, `impossible`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by `n`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `impossible` is True**
