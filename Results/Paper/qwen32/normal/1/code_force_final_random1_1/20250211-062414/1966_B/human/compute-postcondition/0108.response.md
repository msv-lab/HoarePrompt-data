Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` is the value at the end of the previous iteration), `tc` is incremented by `n`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the character at position `j` in the first string of `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` in the first string of `gr`, or the character at position `j` in the last string of `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` in the last string of `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
