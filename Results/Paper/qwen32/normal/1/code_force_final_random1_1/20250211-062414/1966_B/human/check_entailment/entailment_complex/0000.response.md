### Reasoning:
The program checks whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. The logic is based on the observation that if the top-left corner and bottom-right corner of the grid have different colors, then it might be impossible to make the entire grid the same color unless the top row, bottom row, left column, or right column is uniform (i.e., all squares in these rows or columns are the same color).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initial Check**: If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have the same color, the answer is immediately "YES" because we can always make the entire grid that color by selecting appropriate pairs of squares.

2. **Check Rows and Columns**:
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, the program checks if the top row (`gr[0]`) or the bottom row (`gr[n-1]`) is uniform (all squares in the row are the same color).
   - Similarly, it checks if the first column (`gr[i][0]` for all `i`) or the last column (`gr[i][m-1]` for all `i`) is uniform.
   
   If either the top or bottom row is uniform, or either the first or last column is uniform, then it is possible to make the entire grid the same color by performing the specified operations. Otherwise, it is not possible.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the grid is a single cell (`n == 1` and `m == 1`), the answer is trivially "YES".
   - If the grid has only one row or one column, the answer is "YES" if that row or column is uniform, otherwise "NO".

The program correctly implements this logic, and the provided annotated state confirms that it processes each test case as described.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the given constraints and operations.
