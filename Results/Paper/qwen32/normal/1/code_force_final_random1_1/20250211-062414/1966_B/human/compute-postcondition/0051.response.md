The code appends a new input string to the list `gr`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the original input string and the newly appended input string), `i` is incremented by 1, `j` retains its previous value, `impossible` retains its previous value, `ans` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1.**
