The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (which we don't know exactly, but it's the value that allowed the previous iteration to occur), and `n` is greater than 0.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value. Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Given that we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote it as `i + 1` for the next iteration. However, we do know that `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing one line of `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Since we are not given the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing one line of `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

For clarity, if we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing one line of `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is x + 1**.

But since we don't know `x`, we simply say `i` is incremented by 1:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing one line of `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration. Then:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing one line of `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is 3**.

However, without knowing the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, the most accurate answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing one line of `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For simplicity in the final answer format:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing one line of `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is incremented by 1**.
