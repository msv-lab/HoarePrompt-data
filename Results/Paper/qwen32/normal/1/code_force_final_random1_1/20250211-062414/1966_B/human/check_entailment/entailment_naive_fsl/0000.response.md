Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an `n x m` grid the same color using the specified operations. The operations allow selecting two squares of the same color and coloring the entire subrectangle between them with that color.

### Program Analysis
The provided program checks the following conditions:
1. If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have different colors, it then checks if the top row and bottom row are uniform (all squares in the row are the same color).
2. Similarly, it checks if the first column and last column are uniform.
3. If either the top/bottom rows or the first/last columns are not uniform, it concludes that it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

### Potential Issues
The program only checks the top/bottom rows and first/last columns for uniformity. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that the entire grid can be made uniform. Here is a counterexample:

#### Counterexample
Consider the following grid:
```
2 3
WBB
BBW
```
Here, the top-left corner is `W` and the bottom-right corner is `W`, but the grid cannot be made uniform because there is no way to turn the middle column into a single color without affecting other parts of the grid.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. It incorrectly concludes that the grid can be made uniform based solely on the uniformity of the top/bottom rows and first/last columns.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The program fails to account for cases where the grid cannot be made uniform even if the top/bottom rows and first/last columns are uniform. The counterexample provided demonstrates such a scenario.
