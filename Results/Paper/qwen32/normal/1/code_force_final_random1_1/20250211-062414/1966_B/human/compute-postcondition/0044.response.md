Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. `n` is an integer greater than 0.
3. `m` is an integer greater than 0.
4. `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B'.
5. The variable `ans` is initially set to 'YES'.

The logic for determining the value of `ans` is as follows:
- If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then:
  - `i` is set to `n-2`.
  - `j` is set to `m-2`.
  - `impossible` is checked:
    - If any `gr[i][0]` is different from `gr[i+1][0]` or `gr[i][m-1]` is different from `gr[i+1][m-1]` for any `i` in the range `n-1`, then `impossible` is True.
    - Otherwise, `impossible` is False.
  - If `impossible` is True, then `ans` is set to 'NO'.
  - If `impossible` is False, then `ans` remains 'YES'.
- If `gr[0][0]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` remains 'YES'.

Given this logic, the final value of `ans` depends on the specific values of the grid `gr`.

However, since the exact values of `gr` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` definitively. But based on the conditions described, we can describe the possible outcomes:

- If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` could be either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the values along the first and last columns.
- If `gr[0][0]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is 'YES'.

Thus, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be either 'YES' or 'NO', based on the conditions described above.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'YES' if gr[0][0] equals gr[n - 1][m - 1] or if no differing adjacent values are found in the first and last columns; otherwise 'NO')**
