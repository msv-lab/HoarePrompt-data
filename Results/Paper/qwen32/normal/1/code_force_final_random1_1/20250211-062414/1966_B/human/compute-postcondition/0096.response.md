The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and still be less than `n`. However, since `i` is already equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop condition `i < n` would fail, and the loop would not execute again. Therefore, no further iterations are possible based on the current state.

However, if we consider the state right before the last iteration, `i` would have been `n-1`. So, to generalize for the next iteration before reaching the final state where `i == n`, we should set `i` to `n-1` and ensure `n` remains greater than `i`.

Given the task constraints and the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we adjust `i` to `n-1` for the next iteration to potentially satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the original string and the newly appended input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1**

But since the question asks for the state at the start of the next iteration and the loop would not execute again when `i` is `n`, the correct interpretation is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the original string and the newly appended input string), `i` is `n`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1** (indicating the loop has ended as `i` is no longer less than `n`). 

If the task is to show the state right before the loop ends, then:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the original string and the newly appended input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is not yet incremented** (right before `i` becomes `n` and `tc` is incremented). 

Given the problem's context, the most accurate state at the start of the next iteration (which doesn't exist because the loop has ended) is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the original string and the newly appended input string), `i` is `n`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1**
