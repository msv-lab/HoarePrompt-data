Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 2`. If `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` retains its original value. `ans` is 'NO'.**
