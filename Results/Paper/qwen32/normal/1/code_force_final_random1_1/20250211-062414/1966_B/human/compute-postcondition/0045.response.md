The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, which represents the current test case number in the range from `0` to `t-1`. Since the loop iterates over `range(t)`, the value of `tc` needs to be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `j`, `impossible`, and `ans`) should remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is True if any `gr[i][0]` is different from `gr[i+1][0]` or `gr[i][m-1]` is different from `gr[i+1][m-1]` for any `i` in the range `n-1`, otherwise `impossible` is False, and `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'. `tc` is the current test case number and it is incremented by 1.**

Since `tc` is the only variable that changes in the loop head, we increment it by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is True if any `gr[i][0]` is different from `gr[i+1][0]` or `gr[i][m-1]` is different from `gr[i+1][m-1]` for any `i` in the range `n-1`, otherwise `impossible` is False, and `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'. `tc` is incremented by 1.**

To be more precise:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is True if any `gr[i][0]` is different from `gr[i+1][0]` or `gr[i][m-1]` is different from `gr[i+1][m-1]` for any `i` in the range `n-1`, otherwise `impossible` is False, and `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'. `tc` is the current test case number + 1.**

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is True if any `gr[i][0]` is different from `gr[i+1][0]` or `gr[i][m-1]` is different from `gr[i+1][m-1]` for any `i` in the range `n-1`, otherwise `impossible` is False, and `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'. `tc` is incremented by 1.**

Final State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is `n-2` if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, `j` is `m-2` if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, `impossible` is True if any `gr[i][0]` is different from `gr[i+1][0]` or `gr[i][m-1]` is different from `gr[i+1][m-1]` for any `i` in the range `n-1`, otherwise `impossible` is False, and `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` or `impossible` is True, otherwise `ans` remains 'YES'. `tc` is incremented by 1.**
