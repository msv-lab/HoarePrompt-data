Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is 'NO', the first character of the first line (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the last character of the last line (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `j` is m - 2, and `impossible` is True.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` has been changed to 'NO'. All other variables retain their initial values.
