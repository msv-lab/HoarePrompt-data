Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. For each grid, it determines if it's possible to change all characters to the same color ('W' or 'B') by only changing characters in the first row or the last row, or the first column or the last column, while maintaining the condition that no two adjacent characters in the first or last row, or the first or last column, differ. It prints 'YES' if it's possible, otherwise 'NO'.**
