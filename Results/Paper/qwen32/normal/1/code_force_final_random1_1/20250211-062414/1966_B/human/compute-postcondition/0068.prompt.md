Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `impossible` is True, `ans` is 'YES', `tc` is incremented by 1, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m - 1):
    if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
        impossible = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `ans` is 'YES', `tc` is incremented by 1, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the character at position `j` of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` of the first string, or the character at position `j` of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` of the last string, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` retains its value of True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 'YES', `tc` is incremented by 1, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the character at position `j` of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` of the first string, or the character at position `j` of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` of the last string, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` retains its value of True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ans` is 'YES', `tc` is incremented by 1, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the character at position `j` of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` of the first string, or the character at position `j` of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` of the last string, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` retains its value of True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
