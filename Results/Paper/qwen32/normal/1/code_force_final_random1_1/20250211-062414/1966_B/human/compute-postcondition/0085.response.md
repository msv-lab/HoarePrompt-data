The provided code snippet does not actually change the value of `ans` since it is already set to `'NO'`. Therefore, no changes occur to the state of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `tc` is incremented by `n-1`, `impossible` is `True` indicating that at least one pair of consecutive strings in `gr` had differing first or last characters, and `ans` is 'NO'.**
