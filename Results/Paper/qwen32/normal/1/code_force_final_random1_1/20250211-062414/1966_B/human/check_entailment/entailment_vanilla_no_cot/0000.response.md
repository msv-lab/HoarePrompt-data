Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. The key insight is that if there exists a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid where all squares are the same color, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color. This is because we can use operations to propagate the color along this path.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are the same color. If they are different, it then checks if there is a horizontal path (from left to right) or a vertical path (from top to bottom) where all squares are the same color. If such a path exists, it concludes that it's possible to make the entire grid the same color; otherwise, it concludes that it's not possible.

However, this approach is not sufficient. Consider the following counterexample:

```
2 2
BB
WB
```

In this case, the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, but there is no horizontal or vertical path of the same color from the top-left to the bottom-right. However, it is still possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting the two 'B' squares and coloring the entire grid 'B'.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases. It fails to consider paths that are neither strictly horizontal nor strictly vertical but still connect the top-left to the bottom-right corners through squares of the same color.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
