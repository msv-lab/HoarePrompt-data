To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables and the conditions under which it changes them.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Loop Range:** The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates indices from `0` to `n-2`).
- **Condition Check:** For each iteration, the loop checks if the first character (`gr[i][0]`) or the last character (`gr[i][m-1]`) of the current string (`gr[i]`) is different from the corresponding character of the next string (`gr[i+1]`).
- **Effect on Variables:**
  - If the condition is met (`gr[i][0] != gr[i+1][0]` or `gr[i][m-1] != gr[i+1][m-1]`), `impossible` is set to `False`.
  - `ans` is set to `'YES'` if `impossible` is `False`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer from the input (number of strings).
- `m` is the second integer from the input (length of each string).
- `gr` is a list of `n` strings.
- `i` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `j` is initialized to `m-2`.
- `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)`.
- `ans` is initially `'NO'` if `impossible` is `True`.
- `impossible` is `True` if the first character of the first string is not equal to the last character of the last string.

### Iteration Analysis:
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `impossible` could change to `False` if the condition is met.
- This process continues until `i = n-2`.

### Final State:
- **`i` Value:** After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`.
- **`j` Value:** `j` remains `m-2` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`tc` Value:** `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)` once before the loop starts, and it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans` Value:** `ans` will be `'YES'` if any of the conditions in the loop were met (i.e., `impossible` became `False`). Otherwise, it remains `'NO'`.
- **`impossible` Value:** `impossible` will be `False` if any of the conditions in the loop were met. Otherwise, it remains `True`.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations, the final state of the variables is as follows:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `gr` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `j` is `m-2`.
- `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)` once before the loop starts.
- `ans` is `'YES'` if `impossible` became `False` during the loop; otherwise, it is `'NO'`.
- `impossible` is `False` if any of the conditions in the loop were met; otherwise, it is `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string), `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)`, `ans` is 'YES' if `impossible` is `False`, otherwise 'NO', and `impossible` is `False` if any of the conditions in the loop were met, otherwise `True`.**
