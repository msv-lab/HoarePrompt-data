The code appends a line of input to the list `gr`. Given that `m` is the number of columns and the input consists of `n` lines of `m` characters each, appending one line means that `gr` now contains one line of `m` characters, which are either 'W' or 'B'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing one line of `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'**.
