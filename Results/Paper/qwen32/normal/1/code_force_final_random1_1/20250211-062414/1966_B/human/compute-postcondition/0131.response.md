Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string). If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)`, and if `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO'; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'. If `gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `i` retains its value (`n-1`), `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by `n`, and `ans` remains 'YES'.**
