Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is equal to `n`, the first character of the first line (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the last character of the last line (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `j` is m - 2. If `impossible` is True, then `ans` is 'NO'. If `impossible` is False, then `ans` remains 'YES'.**
