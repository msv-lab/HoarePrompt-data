The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 because the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-2`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `m` is an integer greater than 1
- `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B'
- `i` is 0
- `j` is `m - 2`
- `impossible` is a boolean value (either True or False)
- `ans` is a string ('NO')

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 2`, `impossible` is a boolean value (either True or False), `ans` is 'NO'**
