Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by `n`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `impossible` is True.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is the introduction of the new variable `impossible` which is set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
