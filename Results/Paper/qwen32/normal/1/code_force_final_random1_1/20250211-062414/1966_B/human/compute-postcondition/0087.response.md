Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `j` is set to `m - 2`, `tc` is incremented by `n-1`, and if `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO'; otherwise, `ans` is also 'NO'. If `gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` remains 'YES' and other variables retain their previous values.**
