The given code snippet assigns the string `'NO'` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer greater than 1, gr is a list containing n lines of m characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', i is n-2, j is m-2, impossible is True, and ans is 'NO'.**
