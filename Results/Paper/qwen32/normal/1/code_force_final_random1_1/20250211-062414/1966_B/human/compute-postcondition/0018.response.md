The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `m - 2` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the stop value). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `n`, but since `i` is not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted. The same applies to `t`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `ans`, and `impossible`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was `m - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `m - 1`. However, since the range is exclusive of `m - 1`, the loop will not execute again if `j` is set to `m - 1`. Therefore, the loop will terminate after `j` reaches `m - 2`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the last valid iteration) should have `j` set to `m - 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first line (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the last character of the last line (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). If at least one of the following is true: `gr[0][j]` is different from `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is different from `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True, `j` is m - 2**
