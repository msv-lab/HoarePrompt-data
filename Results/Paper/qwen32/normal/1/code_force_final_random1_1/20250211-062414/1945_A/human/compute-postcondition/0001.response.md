The given code snippet is:
```python
a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
```

This line of code splits the string `s` into three parts, converts each part into an integer, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Given the initial state, `t` is at least 1, and the input contains `t` lines, each with three integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. However, the code snippet provided does not involve `t`. It only processes a single line of input represented by the string `s`.

After executing the code, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the integer values from the split string `s`. The initial state specifies the constraints on `a`, `b`, and `c`, which remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, and the input contains `t` lines, each with three integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers obtained from splitting the string `s`.**
