The code reads a line from the input, splits it into three parts, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since `s` is the next line in the input, it contains three integers separated by spaces. These integers are converted to integers and assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.

Given that `a` is unchanged, `b` is `b + c`, and `c` is unchanged in the initial state description, it seems there might be a misunderstanding because the provided code does not modify `b` by adding `c` to it. Instead, it simply assigns the values read from the input line to `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the integers read from the line `s`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, and the input contains `t` lines, each with three integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that 0 ≤ a, b, `c` ≤ 10^9; `a` is the first integer from the line `s`, `b` is the second integer from the line `s`, `c` is the third integer from the line `s`; `s` is the next line in the input.**
