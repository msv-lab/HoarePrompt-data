To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the code and the initial state step by step:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is at least 1.
- The input contains `t` lines, each with three integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that `0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9`.
- `s` is the next line in the input.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers obtained by splitting and converting `s`.
- `b` is then updated to `b + c`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

Let's break this down:

1. **Expression Inside the Print Statement:**
   - `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`
   - This is a tuple indexing expression. It evaluates to either `a - -b // 3` or `-1` depending on the condition `c < b % 3`.

2. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - `c < b % 3`
   - This condition checks if `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3.

3. **Indexing Based on Condition:**
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `-1`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `a - -b // 3`.

4. **Simplifying `a - -b // 3`:**
   - `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a + b // 3` because subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart.

### Final Expression:
- If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the output is `-1`.
- If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the output is `a + b // 3`.

### Output Description:
The output of the print statement depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input line. Specifically, it depends on whether `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3.

- If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the output is `-1`.
- If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the output is `a + b // 3`.

### Final Output Format:
Output: **-1 if c < b % 3 else a + b // 3 (where a, b, and c are the integers from the input line)**
