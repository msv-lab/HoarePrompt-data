The value of `b` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the value of `c`. The values of `a`, `c`, `t`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, and the input contains `t` lines, each with three integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that 0 ≤ a, b, `c` ≤ 10^9; `a` is the first integer from the line `s`, `b` is the second integer from the line `s` plus `c`, `c` is the third integer from the line `s`; `s` is the next line in the input.**
