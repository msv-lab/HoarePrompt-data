Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with some elements potentially set to `True`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[i]` and possibly other elements are `1`, and now `coef[4]` is `1`; `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is `True`; `ok` is updated to `ok or (bipartite and tot != 0)`; `i` is 4.**

In this output state, the variable `bipartite` has been explicitly set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions as described in the initial state.
