Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with some elements potentially set to `True`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[i]` and possibly other elements are `1`; `tot` is a potentially updated integer; `bipartite` is a potentially updated boolean; `ok` is updated to `ok or (bipartite and tot != 0)`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `visited[i]` was initially `False`, then `visited[i]` is now `True` and `coef[i]` is `1`.**
