The code snippet reassigns the variable `x` to be a new list of `None` values with a length of `n`. This overwrites the previous list `x` which contained the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `y` and `r` are lists of integers where `y[i]` are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk with -10^9 <= `y[i]` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `r[i]` <= 10^9 for all i in the range [0, n-1], `visited` and `coef` are lists of length `n` initialized to False and None respectively.**
