Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is `True`; `ok` is `False`.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is the assignment of `False` to the variable `ok`. All other variables retain their initial values.
