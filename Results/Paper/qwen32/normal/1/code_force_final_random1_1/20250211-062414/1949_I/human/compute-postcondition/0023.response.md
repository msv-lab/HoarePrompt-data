Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `i` set to `True` if `visited[i]` was initially `False`, otherwise unchanged; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[i]` which is `1` if `visited[i]` was initially `False`, otherwise unchanged; `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is `True`; `ok` is `False`.**
