The code snippet assigns the first three integer values from the input to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Since the specific index `i` is not provided, we assume `i` is a given index within the range of the lists.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `x[i]` which is an integer; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `y[i]` which is an integer; `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `r[i]` which is an integer; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.** 

This means that only the `i-th` elements of `x`, `y`, and `r` have been updated to integers, while all other variables remain unchanged.
