Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with some elements set to `True` including possibly `visited[4]`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[i]` and possibly other elements are `1`, and now `coef[4]` is `1`; `tot` is updated based on the DFS traversal; `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on the graph properties; `ok` is updated to `ok or (bipartite and tot != 0)`; `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The value of `ok` is updated based on the expression `ok or (bipartite and tot != 0)`. This means that if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not equal to `0`, then `ok` will be set to `True`. Otherwise, `ok` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their previous values.
