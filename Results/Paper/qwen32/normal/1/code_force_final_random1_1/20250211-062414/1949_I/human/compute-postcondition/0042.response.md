The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes various variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, `ok`, `i`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward.

Output: **NO**
