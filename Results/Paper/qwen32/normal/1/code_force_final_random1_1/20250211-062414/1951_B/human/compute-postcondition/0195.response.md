To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how the variables evolve throughout the iterations.

### Key Points:
- The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the following steps occur:
  1. Read `n` and `k`.
  2. Read the list `s` of `n` integers.
  3. Swap the first element `s[0]` with the element at index `k-1`.
  4. Initialize `h` as the new first element of `s` (which is originally `s[k-1]`).
  5. Determine `j` as the index of the first element in `s[1:]` that is greater than `h`. If no such element exists, `j` will be `len(s) - 2`.
  6. Calculate `ans` as the count of elements in `s[1:]` up to index `j` that are less than or equal to `h`.
  7. Restore the original order of `s[0]` and `s[k-1]`.
  8. Swap `s[p]` (where `p` is the value of `j`) with `s[k-1]`.
  9. Recalculate `ans1` as the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` based on specific conditions.
  10. Print the maximum of `ans` and `ans1`.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` iterations, the state of the variables outside the loop remains unchanged (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `s` for each iteration). However, the loop itself does not maintain any state across iterations except for the printed result for each test case.

The final output state is simply the sequence of printed results for each test case.

### Format:
Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

### Human-readable Description:
The output state after all iterations of the loop is a series of printed results, one for each test case. Each result is the maximum of two counts (`ans` and `ans1`) calculated based on the specific conditions described in the loop logic.

Since the problem asks for the output state in a specific format, and given that the output is a series of printed results, we can represent it as follows:

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the result of one test case.**

However, since we do not have the actual input values, we cannot provide the exact series of integers. The format indicates that the output is a sequence of results corresponding to each test case processed by the loop.
