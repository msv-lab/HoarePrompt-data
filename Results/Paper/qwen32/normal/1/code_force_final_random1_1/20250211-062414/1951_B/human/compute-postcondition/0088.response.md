Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the new list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` swapped and must have at least 2 elements; `h` is the value of `s[0]` after the swap; `j` is 3; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `h` is not less than `i`, and by 1 again if `h` is greater than or equal to `i`; `p` is -1; `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` (if `s[0] != h`) or less than or equal to `h` (if `z` was set to 1); `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` was encountered after the first element, otherwise 0; `i` is `s[2]`.**
