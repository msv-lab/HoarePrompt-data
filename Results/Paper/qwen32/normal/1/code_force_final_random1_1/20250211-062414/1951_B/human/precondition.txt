a is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, k, ratings) representing the number of cows, the index of the cow owned by the player, and a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows respectively. Here, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 is the number of test cases, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each rating a_i in ratings. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
