Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n), along with a list `a` of `n` distinct integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
