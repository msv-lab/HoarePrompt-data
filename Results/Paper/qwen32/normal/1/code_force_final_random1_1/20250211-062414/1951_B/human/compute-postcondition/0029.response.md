Postcondition: **`ind` is a list of indices of up to two cows with higher ratings than `x`, and `c` is the count of such cows (0, 1, or 2). Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list. If `k` equals 14, the state of `ind` and `c` remains as described, and all other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `ind` and `c` remains unchanged, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
