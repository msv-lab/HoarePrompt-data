To determine what will be printed by the `print(ind)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `ind` is a list of indices of up to two cows with higher ratings than `x`.
- `c` is the count of such cows (0, 1, or 2).
- `k` equals 14, but it is not used in the `print(ind)` statement.

Given this information, `ind` could be one of the following:
- An empty list `[]` if there are no cows with higher ratings than `x` (i.e., `c` is 0).
- A list with one index `[index1]` if there is exactly one cow with a higher rating than `x` (i.e., `c` is 1).
- A list with two indices `[index1, index2]` if there are exactly two cows with higher ratings than `x` (i.e., `c` is 2).

Since the specific values of `x` and the ratings of the cows are not provided, we cannot determine the exact indices in `ind`. However, we know the structure and possible contents of `ind` based on the count `c`.

Therefore, the output will be a list of indices that could be empty, contain one index, or contain two indices, depending on the value of `c`.

Output: **ind (where ind is a list of indices of up to two cows with higher ratings than x, and the length of ind is c, where c is 0, 1, or 2)**
