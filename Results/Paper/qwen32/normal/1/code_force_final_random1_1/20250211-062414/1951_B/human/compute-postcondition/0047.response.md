Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a list `a` containing multiple test cases. Each test case includes the number of cows `n`, the index `k` of the player's cow, and a list of distinct Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. For each test case, the function determines and returns a value based on the ratings relative to the player's cow. The return value can be `n - 1`, `k - 1`, or a calculated value derived from the indices of up to two cows with higher ratings than the player's cow.**
