Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following 2`t` elements describes a test case: the first element of each test case is a pair of integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`) representing the number of cows and the index of the cow owned by the player, respectively. The second element of each test case is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i` being distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `x` is the rating of the cow owned by the player for the current test case, which is `a[k]`. `ind` is an empty list. `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > x:
        ind.append(i)
        c += 1
    if c == 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the rating of the cow owned by the player for the current test case, which is `a[k]`. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` is a list containing the index `i` and `c` is 1. Otherwise, `ind` remains an empty list and `c` remains 0. Additionally, if `c` was equal to 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `x` is the rating of the cow owned by the player for the current test case, which is `a[k]`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, `ind` includes the current value of `i` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `c` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the rating of the cow owned by the player for the current test case, which is `a[k]`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, `ind` includes the new element `i` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `c` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
