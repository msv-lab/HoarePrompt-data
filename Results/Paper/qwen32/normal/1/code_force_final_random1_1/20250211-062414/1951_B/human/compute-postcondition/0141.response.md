Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` swapped with `s[k-1]` and must have at least two elements; `h` is the value of `s[0]`; `j` is 0; `ans` is 0; `p` is the value of `j`; `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` starting from the first occurrence of `h` in `s[1:]` (if any); `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `h` was encountered`; `h` is greater than or equal to `i`.**
