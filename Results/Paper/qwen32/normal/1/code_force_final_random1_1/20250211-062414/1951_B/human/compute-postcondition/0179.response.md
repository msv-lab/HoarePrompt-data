Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers read from the input with `s[p]` swapped with `s[k-1]` and must have at least one element; `h` is the value of `s[0]` (before the swap); `j` is the index of the last element compared to `h` before the loop breaks or completes, incremented by 1; `p` is the value of `j`; `i` is `s[j]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `j`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only additional information is that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
