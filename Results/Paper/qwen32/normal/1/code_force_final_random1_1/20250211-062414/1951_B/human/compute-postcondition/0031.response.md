Postcondition: **`ind` is a list containing exactly one index of a cow with a higher rating than `x`, and `c` is 1. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list. The current value of `ind[0]` is 0. If `k` equals 14, the state of `ind` and `c` remains as described, and all other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `ind` and `c` remains unchanged, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
