The code snippet `ind.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `ind`. This means that the list `ind` will now include the new value of `i` at the end of its existing elements.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4).
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x` is the rating of the cow owned by the player for the current test case, which is `a[k]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

After executing `ind.append(i)`, the only change is that the list `ind` now includes the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `x` is the rating of the cow owned by the player for the current test case, which is `a[k]`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `ind` includes the current value of `i`.**
