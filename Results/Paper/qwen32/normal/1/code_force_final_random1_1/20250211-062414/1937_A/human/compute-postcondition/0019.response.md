To determine the output of the `print(2 ** power)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relationships between the variables:

1. **Variable `t`:** An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not directly influence the calculation of `2 ** power` in the given context.
2. **Variable `n_cases`:** Mentioned to be greater than 0, but it is also not directly involved in the calculation of `2 ** power`.
3. **Variable `n`:** Defined as the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`. This implies that if the original `n` was some value, say `N`, then `n = \log_2(N)`.
4. **Variable `power`:** Initially defined as `power - 1`. This suggests that `power` is being decremented by 1 before being used in the expression `2 ** power`.

Given the above, we need to determine the value of `2 ** power` after `power` has been decremented by 1. However, the exact value of `power` before decrementing is not specified. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the decremented `power`.

Let's denote the original value of `power` as `P`. After the decrement, `power` becomes `P - 1`. Thus, the expression `2 ** power` evaluates to `2 ** (P - 1)`.

Since the exact value of `P` is not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **2 ** (power - 1) (where power is the original value of power decremented by 1)**
