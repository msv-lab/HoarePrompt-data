You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves an array `a` where initially `a[i] = i` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. We perform a series of swaps on this array. For each integer `i` from 2 to `n`, we find the largest proper divisor `d` of `i` (a divisor of `i` other than `i` itself) and swap `a[d]` with `a[i]`. After performing all these swaps, we need to find the position of the element `1` in the final array.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial Setup**: The initial array is `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
2. **Swap Operation**: For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the element at position `i` is swapped with the element at the position of its largest proper divisor.
3. **Final Position of 1**: The goal is to determine the final position of the element `1`.

### Pattern Recognition

The pattern that emerges is that the element `1` will end up at the position `2^k` where `k` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. This is because the largest proper divisor of powers of 2 is always another power of 2, and the swapping process effectively moves `1` to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to determine the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` using logarithms and then prints `2` raised to that power.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
- If `n` is `1`, it directly prints `1` since no swaps are needed.
- Otherwise, it calculates the base-2 logarithm of `n` and finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` by rounding down the logarithm and then taking `2` to that power.
- If `n` is exactly a power of 2, it prints `2` raised to that power.
- If `n` is not a power of 2, it prints `2` raised to the power just below the logarithm.

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the solution against the provided test cases:
1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Solution Output: `1` (correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 4`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Solution Output: `4` (correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Solution Output: `4` (correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 120240229`
   - Expected Output: `67108864`
   - Solution Output: `67108864` (correct)

### Conclusion

The solution correctly determines the final position of the element `1` in the array after performing the specified swaps. It efficiently computes the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` and uses it to find the correct position.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
