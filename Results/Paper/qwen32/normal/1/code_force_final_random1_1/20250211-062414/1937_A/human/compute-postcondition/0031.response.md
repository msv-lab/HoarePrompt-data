To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop condition, which are `power` and `n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(3 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n_cases` is greater than 0
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`
- `power` is 2
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not part of the loop condition)

The loop condition is:
```
while power < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`. Since `power` is incremented within the loop, we need to ensure that after the increment, `power` remains less than `n`.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `power` is 2.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `t`.

Since `t` is between 3 and \(10^4\), the range of `n` (base-2 logarithm of `t`) is approximately between 1.585 and 13.287 (since \(\log_2(3) \approx 1.585\) and \(\log_2(10^4) \approx 13.287\)).

For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`. Given that `power` starts at 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 2. Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `t`, `t` must be greater than \(2^2 = 4\).

So, the state should be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 4, which means `n` will be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(4 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
