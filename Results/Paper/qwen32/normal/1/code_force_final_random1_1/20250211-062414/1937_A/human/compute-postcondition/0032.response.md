Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(4 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is 3, `i` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The value of `power` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
