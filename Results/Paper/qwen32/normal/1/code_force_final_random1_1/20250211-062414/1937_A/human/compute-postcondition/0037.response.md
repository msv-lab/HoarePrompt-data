Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is not necessarily equal to `n` but has been decremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition `(power == n)` is false.**

Explanation: The value of `power` has been decreased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
