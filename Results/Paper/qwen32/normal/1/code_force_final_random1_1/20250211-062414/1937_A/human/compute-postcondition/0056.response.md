The given code snippet decrements the value of `power` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that the if condition `(power == n)` is false, this means `power` was not equal to `n` before the decrement operation. After decrementing `power`, it will still not be equal to `n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n_cases` is greater than 0.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`.
- `power` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is incremented by `n - 1`.
- The if condition `(power == n)` is false.

After executing `power -= 1`, `power` will be `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is `n - 1`, `i` is incremented by `n - 1`.**
