To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `power < n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n_cases` is greater than 0
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`
- `power` is 1

The loop condition is `power < n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `power` must be less than `n`.

Since `power` is initialized to 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

### Analysis:
- `n` is defined as the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`. Therefore, `n` is a value such that \( n = \log_2(\text{original } n) \).
- For `power < n` to be true when `power` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1.

### Conclusion:
The only variable we can adjust based on the loop condition is `n`. We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Thus, the state should be modified to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `power` is 1**
