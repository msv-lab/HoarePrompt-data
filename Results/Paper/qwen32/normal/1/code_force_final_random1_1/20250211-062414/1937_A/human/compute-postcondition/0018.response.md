The value of `power` is decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n_cases`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`, and `power` is now `power - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`, `power` is `power - 1`.**
