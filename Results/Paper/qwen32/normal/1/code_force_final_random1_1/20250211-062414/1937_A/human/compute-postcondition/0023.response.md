The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` based on user input. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `power`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `power` is either equal to `n` or decremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.
