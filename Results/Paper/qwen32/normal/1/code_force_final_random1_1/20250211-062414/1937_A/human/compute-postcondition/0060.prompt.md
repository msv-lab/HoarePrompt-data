Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is the integer read from the input representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        n = log2(n)
        while power < n:
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, and `n` is an integer. If the original value of `n` is 1, then `n` remains 1. Otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`, and `power` is either equal to `n` if it was already equal to `n`, or `power` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer if `n` is not equal to 1, otherwise `n` remains unchanged, `power` is either equal to `n` or decremented by 1 depending on its initial value, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is equal to 1, `n` becomes the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` equals 1, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `i` is incremented by `n - 1` in addition to the initial increment, and if `power` equals `n`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `power` is set to `n - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
