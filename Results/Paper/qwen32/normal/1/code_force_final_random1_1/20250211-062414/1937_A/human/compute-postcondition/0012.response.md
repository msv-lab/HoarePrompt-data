To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition. In this case, the loop condition is `while power < n:`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `power` is less than `n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n_cases` is greater than 0
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `power` is 3

For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`. Since `power` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition.

Therefore, the modified state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `power` is 3**
