Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` equals 1, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `i` is incremented by `n - 1` in addition to the initial increment, and if `power` equals `n`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `power` is set to `n - 1`.**
