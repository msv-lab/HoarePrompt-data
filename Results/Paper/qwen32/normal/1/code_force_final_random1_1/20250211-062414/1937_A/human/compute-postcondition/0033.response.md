To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses based on the given conditions and outputs.

The loop continues as long as `power < n`. Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. After the first iteration, `power` becomes 2.
2. After the second iteration, `power` remains 2 (as per the given output state, which seems to be a typo or misinterpretation, but we will proceed with the logical progression).
3. After the third iteration, `power` becomes 3.

From these observations, it's clear that `power` increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

Let's analyze the range of `t` and its corresponding `n` (base-2 logarithm of `t`):

- For `t = 3`, `n ≈ 1.585`.
- For `t = 4`, `n = 2`.
- For `t = 5`, `n ≈ 2.322`.
- For `t = 6`, `n ≈ 2.585`.
- For `t = 7`, `n ≈ 2.807`.
- For `t = 8`, `n = 3`.

Given that `power` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will run until `power` equals `n`. Therefore, if `t` is such that `n` is an integer, the loop will run exactly `n-1` times.

From the provided output states, we see that for `t = 4` (where `n = 2`), the loop runs once (`power` goes from 1 to 2). For `t = 8` (where `n = 3`), the loop runs twice (`power` goes from 1 to 3).

Thus, for the general case where `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `t` and `n` is an integer, the loop will run `n-1` times, and `power` will end up equal to `n`.

Therefore, the final output state of the loop, assuming `t` is such that `n` is an integer, will be:

- `power` will be equal to `n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state except for `power`.

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for `t`, we can generalize that the loop will terminate when `power` equals `n`, the base-2 logarithm of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the loop will finish when `power` equals the base-2 logarithm of `t`, and all other variables remain as initially stated except for `power`.
