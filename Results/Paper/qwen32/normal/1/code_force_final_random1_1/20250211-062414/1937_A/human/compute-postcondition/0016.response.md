Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n_cases` is greater than 0.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`.
- `power` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `power` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`.
- `n` is described as the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`. However, this seems to be a bit confusing because it suggests that `n` is both the logarithm and the original number. Let's assume that there was a typo and `n` is actually the result of taking the base-2 logarithm of some original number, say `original_n`. Therefore, `n` would be `log2(original_n)`.
- Given that `power` is equal to `n`, we have `power = log2(original_n)`.
- The expression `2 ** power` can be rewritten as `2 ** log2(original_n)`.
- By the properties of logarithms, `2 ** log2(original_n)` simplifies to `original_n`.

However, since the original number `original_n` is not provided in the initial state, we can only express the output in terms of `power` or `n`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `power` is equal to `n` and `n` is the base-2 logarithm of some original number, the expression `2 ** power` will return the original number. Since the original number is not explicitly given, we can only express the output as `2 ** power`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be `2 ** power`, which is equivalent to the original number `original_n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 ** power (where power is the base-2 logarithm of the original number)**

However, if we assume that `n` itself is the original number (which is a more straightforward interpretation given the problem statement), then the output would simply be `n`.

### Final Output (assuming n is the original number):
Output: **n**
