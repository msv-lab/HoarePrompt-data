To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information:

1. The loop condition is `while power < n`.
2. The variables involved in this condition are `power` and `n`.

From the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is greater than 0.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`.
- `power` is 2.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not part of the loop condition).

For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`. Since `power` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

Let's express `n` in terms of `t`: 
\[ n = \log_2(t) \]
So, for the loop to execute again:
\[ \log_2(t) > 2 \]
\[ t > 2^2 \]
\[ t > 4 \]

Thus, `t` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute one more time. 

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(4 < t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
