To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition. The loop condition is `power < n`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it does not need adjustment).
- `n_cases` is greater than 0 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it does not need adjustment).
- `n` must be greater than 1 (this variable is part of the loop condition).
- `power` is 2 (this variable is part of the loop condition).

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < n` must be true. Given that `power` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 2. Here is the modified state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 2**
