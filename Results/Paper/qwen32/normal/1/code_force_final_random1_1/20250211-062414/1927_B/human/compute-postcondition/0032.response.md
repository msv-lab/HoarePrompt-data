The code snippet provided reverses the `array` and assigns it to `rev_array`. Given that `rev_array` was already defined as the reverse of `array` in the initial state, executing this line does not change the value of `rev_array` since it is already the reverse of `array`.

Here's the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `l` is the new input integer; `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `rev_array` is the reverse of the new `array`; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `ans` is a list with `l` additional lowercase letters, each determined by the count of elements in the reversed new `array` starting from the corresponding index; `j` is `l`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The state remains the same because `rev_array` was already correctly defined as the reverse of `array`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.
