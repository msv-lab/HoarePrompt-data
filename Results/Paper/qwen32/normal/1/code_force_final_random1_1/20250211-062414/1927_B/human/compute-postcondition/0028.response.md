In the given task, the loop head only contains the variable `i` and the range function which takes an integer input. The loop iterates based on this input, and the state of other variables does not directly affect whether the loop can execute further.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4;
- `l` must be greater than or equal to the current value of `j` (which will be `l` after the loop ends);
- `array` is a new list of integers read from input;
- `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'];
- `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`;
- `ans` is a list with `l` additional lowercase letters, each determined by the count of elements in the reversed array starting from the corresponding index;
- `j` is `l`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses. The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `array`, `alp`, `rev_array`, `ans`, `j`) are not part of the loop head and thus their values do not change due to the loop itself.

Since the loop runs for `int(input())` iterations, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than this input value. After the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented, so we need to increment it again for the next iteration.

Let's assume the loop ran for `x` iterations previously, meaning `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

However, since we don't know the exact number of iterations that have already occurred, we can generalize that `i` should simply be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` must be greater than or equal to the current value of `j` (which will be `l` after the loop ends); `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list with `l` additional lowercase letters, each determined by the count of elements in the reversed array starting from the corresponding index; `j` is `l`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` must be greater than or equal to the current value of `j` (which will be `l` after the loop ends); `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list with `l` additional lowercase letters, each determined by the count of elements in the reversed array starting from the corresponding index; `j` is `l`; `i` is incremented by 1**

For simplicity and clarity, if we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` must be greater than or equal to the current value of `j` (which will be `l` after the loop ends); `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list with `l` additional lowercase letters, each determined by the count of elements in the reversed array starting from the corresponding index; `j` is `l`; `i` is `x + 1`**

Since we don't have the exact value of `x`, we can just say `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` must be greater than or equal to the current value of `j` (which will be `l` after the loop ends); `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list with `l` additional lowercase letters, each determined by the count of elements in the reversed array starting from the corresponding index; `j` is `l`; `i` is incremented by 1**

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` must be greater than or equal to the current value of `j` (which will be `l` after the loop ends); `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list with `l` additional lowercase letters, each determined by the count of elements in the reversed array starting from the corresponding index; `j` is `l`; `i` is incremented by 1**
