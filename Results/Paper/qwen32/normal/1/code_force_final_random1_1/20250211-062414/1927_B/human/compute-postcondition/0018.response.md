The code snippet `rev_array = array[::-1]` reverses the order of elements in the `array` and assigns the reversed list to `rev_array`. This means that the elements of `rev_array` are now in the opposite order compared to `array`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `rev_array`, which now holds the reversed version of `array`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `l` is the input integer; `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list containing `l` lowercase letters, where each letter is determined by the count of the corresponding element in `rev_array` minus one, used as an index for `alp`; `i` is incremented by 1**
