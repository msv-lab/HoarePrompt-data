The given code snippet only initializes a list `alp` containing the lowercase English alphabet. It does not modify the existing variables `t`, `l`, or `array`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `l`, and `array` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters.**
