Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm',
        'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
    rev_array = array[::-1]
    ans = []
    for j in range(l):
        ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
    print(''.join(map(str, ans)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is the length of the array; `array` is a list of integers; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list containing `l` lowercase letters, where each letter is determined by the count of the corresponding element in `rev_array` minus one, used as an index for `alp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` must be greater than or equal to the current value of `j` (which will be `l` after the loop ends); `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list with `l` additional lowercase letters, each determined by the count of elements in the reversed array starting from the corresponding index; `j` is `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is the length of the input list `array`; `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `rev_array` is the reverse of the new `array`; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters; `ans` contains `l` characters where each character is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for `j` from 0 to `l-1`; `j` is `l-1`; `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
