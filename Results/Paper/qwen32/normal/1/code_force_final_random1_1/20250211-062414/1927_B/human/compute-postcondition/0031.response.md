The given code snippet reassigns the variable `alp` to a list of lowercase English alphabet characters. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `l`, `array`, `rev_array`, `ans`, `j`, or `i`. The only change is that `alp` is reassigned to the specified list of alphabet characters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is the new input integer; `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `rev_array` is the reverse of the new `array`; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `ans` is a list with `l` additional lowercase letters, each determined by the count of elements in the reversed new `array` starting from the corresponding index; `j` is `l`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
