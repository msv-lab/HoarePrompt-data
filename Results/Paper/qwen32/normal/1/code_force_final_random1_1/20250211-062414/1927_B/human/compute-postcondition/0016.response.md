The given code snippet updates the `array` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into components, converting each component to an integer, and storing these integers in a list.

Given the initial state, `array` was previously defined as a list of integers, and `rev_array` was the reverse of `array`. However, after executing the new code, `array` is reassigned to a new list of integers derived from the input, which means `rev_array` is no longer the reverse of `array` unless recalculated.

The other variables (`t`, `l`, `alp`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `l` is the input integer; `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters; `rev_array` is no longer necessarily the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list containing `l` lowercase letters, where each letter is determined by the count of the corresponding element in `rev_array` minus one, used as an index for `alp`; `i` is incremented by 1**.
