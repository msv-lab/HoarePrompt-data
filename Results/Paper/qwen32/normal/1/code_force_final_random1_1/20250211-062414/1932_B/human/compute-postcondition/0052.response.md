Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `test_cases` contains at least three test cases.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21.
- `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element.
- `current_year` is 0.
- `current_year % ai` is not equal to 0 (where `ai` is an element of `a`).

Code Snippet:
```python
next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
```

Since `current_year` is 0, the expression `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` simplifies to `(0 // ai + 1) * ai`, which further simplifies to `1 * ai`, or simply `ai`.

Thus, `next_year` is assigned the value of `ai`.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases; `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21; `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element; `current_year` is 0; `next_year` is `ai`.**

In natural language: The value of `next_year` is set to the value of `ai`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
