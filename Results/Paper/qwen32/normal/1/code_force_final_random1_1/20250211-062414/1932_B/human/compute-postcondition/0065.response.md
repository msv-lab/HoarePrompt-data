To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies `current_year` based on the values in the list `a`. Let's break down the process step-by-step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `test_cases`: Contains at least three test cases.
- `results`: A list with two elements `[0, 21]`.
- `test`: The third test case in `test_cases`.
- `n`: An integer from the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `a`: A list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `current_year`: Initially set to `0`.

### Loop Execution Details:
The loop iterates over each element `ai` in the list `a`. For each iteration:
- If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`.
- Otherwise, `next_year` is set to the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
- `current_year` is updated to `next_year`.

### Given Output States After Iterations:
1. **After 1st iteration**:
   - `current_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `a[0]` that is greater than or equal to `0`.

2. **After 2nd iteration**:
   - `current_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `a[1]` that is greater than or equal to the result of the first iteration.

3. **After 3rd iteration**:
   - `current_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `a[2]` that is greater than or equal to the result of the second iteration.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue iterating through all elements in `a`. After all iterations, `current_year` will be the smallest common multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to `0`. This is essentially the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`.

### Conclusion:
The final `current_year` will be the LCM of the list `a`.

**Output State: **`current_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `a`.**

In natural language: After all iterations, `current_year` will be the smallest number that is a multiple of every number in the list `a`.
