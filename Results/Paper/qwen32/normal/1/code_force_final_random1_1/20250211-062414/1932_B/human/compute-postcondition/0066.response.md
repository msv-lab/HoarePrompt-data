The code appends the value of `current_year` to the list `results`. The value of `current_year` remains unchanged as it is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `a`. The only change is that `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element.

Output State: **`current_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `a`; `results` includes `current_year` as its last element.**
