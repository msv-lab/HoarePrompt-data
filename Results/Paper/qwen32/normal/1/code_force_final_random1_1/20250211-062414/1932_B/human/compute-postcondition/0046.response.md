The code snippet `n, a = test` assigns the first element of `test` to `n` and the second element of `test` to `a`. Given that `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` contains at least three test cases, `test` is a tuple where the first element is an integer (`n`) and the second element is a list of integers (`a`). 

Since `n` and `a` are updated to the values from `test`, the output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21, `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases`, `current_year` is 21. After execution, `n` is the integer part of the third test case, and `a` is the list part of the third test case.**
