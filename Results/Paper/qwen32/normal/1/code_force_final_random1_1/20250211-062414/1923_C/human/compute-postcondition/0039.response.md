Let's analyze the given Python code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n` and `m-1`: Integers read from the input with `m-1` being non-negative.
   - `l`: A list of integers read from the input.
   - `p`: A list starting with `[0]` followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`.
   - `c`: A list starting with `[0]` followed by cumulative counts of `1`s in `l`.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers read from the input.
   - `s`: Calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
   - `i`: Calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
   - `j`: Total count of `1`s in `l`.

2. **Condition:**
   - The print statement `print('YES')` will execute if the following condition holds:
     - `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`.

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print('YES')` is unconditional in the given code snippet. It does not depend on any conditional checks within the snippet itself. Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m-1`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `i`, or `j`, the output will always be `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The code snippet provided will always print `'YES'` because there are no conditional statements controlling the execution of the `print` statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
