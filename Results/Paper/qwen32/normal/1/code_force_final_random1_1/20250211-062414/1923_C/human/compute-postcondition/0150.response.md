Output State: **After all iterations, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the total number of test cases. Each test case has been fully processed, meaning for each test case, `n` and `m` were read, `l` was a list of integers, `p` and `c` were lists constructed based on cumulative sums and counts of `1`s in `l`, and `m` queries were processed. The final values of `i` and `j` reflect the sum of all elements in `l` and the count of `1`s in `l` from the last processed test case. The variables `a` and `b` hold the values from the last query processed in the last test case, and `s` holds the sum of elements in `l` from index `a` to `b` for that last query. All queries for all test cases have been evaluated, and 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed accordingly.**

In simpler terms, after all the loops finish, we have processed all the test cases as described. For each test case, we've calculated the cumulative sums and counts of `1`s, and we've answered all the queries by printing 'YES' or 'NO'. The variables `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, `p`, and `c` reflect the state of the last test case and its last query.
