The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. Therefore, the list `c` will now have one more element, which is the value of `j`.

Given the initial state, the value of `j` could be either incremented by 1 (if `x` was equal to 1) or remain unchanged (if `x` was not equal to 1). However, the exact value of `j` is not specified, so we will denote it as `j` in the output state.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `p` is [0, i, i], `c` is [0, j, j], `i` is `i + 2*x`, `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input, and `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
