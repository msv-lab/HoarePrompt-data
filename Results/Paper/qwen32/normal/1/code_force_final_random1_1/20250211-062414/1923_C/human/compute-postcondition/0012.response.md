The code appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial conditions, `c` initially contains a single element `[0]`. After appending `j`, `c` will contain two elements: the original `0` and the value of `j`.

- If `x` is equal to 1, then `j` is 1, and `c` becomes `[0, 1]`.
- If `x` is not equal to 1, then `j` is 0, and `c` becomes `[0, 0]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j]`; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains 0.**
