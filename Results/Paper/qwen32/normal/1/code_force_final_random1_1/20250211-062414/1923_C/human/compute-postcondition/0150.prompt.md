Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [0]
    c = [0]
    i, j = 0, 0
    for x in l:
        if x == 1:
            j += 1
        i += x
        p.append(i)
        c.append(j)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
        s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` and `j` are integers that represent the final count of `1`s in the last processed sublist and the total count of `1`s in `l` respectively after the last iteration. The loop has executed `m` times, and for each iteration, `a` and `b` were integers read from the input, `s` was the sum of elements in `l` from index `a` to `b`, and `i` was the count of `1`s in the sublist of `l` from index `a` to `b`. For each iteration, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, 'YES' was printed; otherwise, 'NO' was printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is [0] followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is [0] followed by the cumulative counts of 1s encountered in `l` up to each point in the list, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`. The loop has executed all `m` iterations, and the values of `a` and `b` from the last iteration are the most recent integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is 0, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `p` is `[0] + [cumulative sums of elements in l]`, `c` is `[0] + [cumulative counts of 1s in l]`, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l` from the last iteration, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. The loop has finished executing all `m` iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
