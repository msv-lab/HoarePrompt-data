You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [0]
        
        c = [0]
        
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the total number of test cases. Each test case has been fully processed, meaning for each test case, `n` and `m` were read, `l` was a list of integers, `p` and `c` were lists constructed based on cumulative sums and counts of `1`s in `l`, and `m` queries were processed. The final values of `i` and `j` reflect the sum of all elements in `l` and the count of `1`s in `l` from the last processed test case. The variables `a` and `b` hold the values from the last query processed in the last test case, and `s` holds the sum of elements in `l` from index `a` to `b` for that last query. All queries for all test cases have been evaluated, and 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `q`, where `n` is the length of a list `c` containing `n` integers, and `q` is the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing a range within the list `c`. The function processes these queries and returns the result for each query, which is not specified in detail here but typically involves some computation or retrieval based on the range `[l_i, r_i]` within the list `c`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
