The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, `s`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of these variables does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward:

Output: **YES**
