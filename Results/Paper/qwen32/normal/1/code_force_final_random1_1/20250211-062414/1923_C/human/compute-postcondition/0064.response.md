The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is either 0 or 1. After the increment, `j` will be either 1 or 2.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `i` is the next element in the list `l`, `j` is 1 or 2**.
