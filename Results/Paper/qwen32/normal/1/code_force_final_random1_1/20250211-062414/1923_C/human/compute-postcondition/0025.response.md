To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables based on the input list `l`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4 (unchanged throughout the loop).
   - `n` and `m`: Integers read from the input (unchanged throughout the loop).
   - `l`: A list of integers read from the input.
   - `p`: Initially `[0]`.
   - `c`: Initially `[0]`.
   - `i`: Initially `0`.
   - `j`: Initially `0`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `x` in `l`:
     - If `x == 1`, increment `j` by 1.
     - Add `x` to `i`.
     - Append `i` to `p`.
     - Append `j` to `c`.

After the loop completes, the final state will be:
- `t`: Remains unchanged.
- `n` and `m`: Remain unchanged.
- `l`: Remains unchanged.
- `p`: A list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c`: A list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`.
- `i`: The sum of all elements in `l`.
- `j`: The total count of `1`s in `l`.

Let's formalize this in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`; `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing for all elements in `l`, `p` will have the cumulative sums of the elements in `l` starting with `0`, `c` will have the cumulative counts of `1`s starting with `0`, `i` will be the total sum of all elements in `l`, and `j` will be the total count of `1`s in `l`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged.
