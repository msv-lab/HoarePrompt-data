The code snippet `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `i` is initially `2 * x`. After the increment, `i` becomes `2 * x + x`, which simplifies to `3 * x`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x, 2 * x]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j, j]`; `i` is `3 * x`; `j` is 2 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
