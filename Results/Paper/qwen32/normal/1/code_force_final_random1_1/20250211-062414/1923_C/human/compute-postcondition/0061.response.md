The code appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given that `p` initially contains only `[0]`, after appending `i`, `p` will contain `[0, i]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` remain integers read from the input with `m` greater than or equal to 0.
- `l` remains a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element.
- `p` is now `[0, i]`.
- `c` remains a list containing `[0]`.
- `i` remains `x`.
- `j` remains 1 if `x` equals 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `c` is `[0]`, `i` is `x`, `j` is 1 if `x` equals 1; otherwise, `j` is 0.**
