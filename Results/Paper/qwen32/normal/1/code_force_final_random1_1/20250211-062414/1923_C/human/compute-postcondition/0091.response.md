Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is `m - 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is [0] followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is [0] followed by the cumulative counts of 1s encountered in `l` up to each point in the list, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the if part executes; otherwise, the else part executes. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.**
