The code snippet appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `c` is either `[0, i, i, i]` or `[0, j+1, j+1]` depending on whether `x` is 1 or not. After appending `j`, the new state of `c` will be:

- If `x` is not 1, `c` was initially `[0, i, i, i]` and becomes `[0, i, i, i, j]`.
- If `x` is 1, `c` was initially `[0, j+1, j+1]` and becomes `[0, j+1, j+1, j]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i, i, i]`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is `[0, i, i, i, j]` if `x` is not 1, otherwise `c` is `[0, j+1, j+1, j]`.**
