Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if a subarray `c[l:r+1]` is "good" based on three conditions:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray must equal the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
2. Each element in the subarray `c` must differ from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` must be greater than 0.

### Program Analysis
Here's what the provided program does:
1. It reads multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, and the array `l` (which is actually the array `c` in the problem statement).
3. It constructs two prefix arrays:
   - `p`: prefix sum array where `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`.
   - `c`: prefix count array where `c[i]` is the count of `1`s in the first `i` elements of `l`.
4. For each query, it calculates the sum `s` and the count `i` of `1`s in the subarray `l[a-1:b]` using the prefix arrays.
5. It checks if the subarray is "good" based on the condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i`. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Condition Analysis
The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element, which is necessary for condition 2 (each element in `c` must differ from the corresponding element in `b`).

The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is supposed to ensure that we can construct an array `b` where each element is different from the corresponding element in `c` and all elements in `b` are greater than 0. Here's how it works:
- `s` is the sum of the subarray.
- `b - a + 1` is the length of the subarray.
- `i` is the count of `1`s in the subarray.
- `s - (b - a + 1)` gives the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray, which should be enough to distribute among the remaining elements (after setting each `1` to at least `2`) to ensure all elements in `b` are greater than 0 and different from `c`.

### Conclusion
The logic in the program seems correct based on the analysis above. The program correctly uses prefix sums and counts to efficiently check the conditions for each query.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
