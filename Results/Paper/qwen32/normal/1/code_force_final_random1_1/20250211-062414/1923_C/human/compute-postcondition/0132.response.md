Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `p` is `[0] + [cumulative sums of elements in l]`, `c` is `[0] + [cumulative counts of 1s in l]`, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in l, `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. Additionally, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.**
