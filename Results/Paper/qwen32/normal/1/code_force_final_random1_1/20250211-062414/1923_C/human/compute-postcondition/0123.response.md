The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. This means that the length of `p` increases by one, and the last element of `p` is now `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input (unchanged).
- `m` is the second integer read from the input (unchanged).
- `l` is a non-empty list of integers (unchanged).
- `p` is initially `[0, i, i]` and now becomes `[0, i, i, i]` (updated).
- `c` is `[0, j, j]` (unchanged).
- `i` is `i + 2*x + x` (unchanged).
- `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged (unchanged).
- `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input (unchanged).
- `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` (unchanged).
- `x` is the next element in the list `l` (unchanged).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `m` is the second integer read from the input; `l` is a non-empty list of integers; `p` is `[0, i, i, i]`; `c` is `[0, j, j]`; `i` is `i + 2*x + x`; `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
