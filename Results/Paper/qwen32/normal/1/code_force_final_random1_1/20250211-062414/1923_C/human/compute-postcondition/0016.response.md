The code increments the variable `i` by the value of `x`. Given that `i` was initially set to `x`, after the operation `i += x`, the new value of `i` will be `2 * x`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` remain integers read from the input.
- `l` remains a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element.
- `p` remains a list containing the elements `[0, x]`.
- `c` remains a list containing the elements `[0, j]`.
- `i` is now `2 * x`.
- `j` remains 2 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j]`; `i` is `2 * x`; `j` is 2 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` is 1.**
