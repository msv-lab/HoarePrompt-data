The code snippet `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `i` is initially 0. The new value of `i` will be `0 + x`, which simplifies to `x`.

Since the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `i`. However, we know that `i` will be equal to `x` after the operation.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing `[0]`, `c` is a list containing `[0]`, `i` is `x`, and `j` is 1 if `x` equals 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
