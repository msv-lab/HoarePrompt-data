The code snippet `i = c[b] - c[a - 1]` updates the value of `i`. The new value of `i` is the difference between the cumulative counts of 1s up to index `b` and the cumulative counts of 1s up to index `a-1`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `j`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged except for `i`. The new value of `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `p` is `[0] + [cumulative sums of elements in l]`, `c` is `[0] + [cumulative counts of 1s in l]`, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in l, `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**.
