The given code snippet appends the integer `a` to the list associated with the key `b` in the `rev` dictionary. This means that `rev[b]` now includes `a` as its last element.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `rev`. Specifically, the list stored under the key `b` in `rev` gains `a` as a new element at the end of the list.

All other variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `u_1`, `x`, `y`, `lst`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` is at least 2, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory where `lst[a]` includes `b` as its last element, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` includes `a` as its last element.**
