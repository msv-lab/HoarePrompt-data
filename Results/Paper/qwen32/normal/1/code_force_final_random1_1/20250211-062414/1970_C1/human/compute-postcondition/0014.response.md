The given code snippet appends the integer `a` to the list associated with the key `b` in the `rev` defaultdict. This means that if `rev[b]` already contained some elements, `a` will be added to the end of that list. If `rev[b]` was previously empty, it will now contain only the element `a`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `rev`. Specifically, `rev[b]` will now include `a` as its last element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` is at least 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory where `lst[a]` includes `b` as its last element, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` includes `a` as its last element, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
