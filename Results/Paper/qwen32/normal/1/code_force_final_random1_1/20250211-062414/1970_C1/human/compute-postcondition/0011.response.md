The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. However, the loop runs `x - 1` times, so the variable controlling the number of iterations is `x`.

Given that the loop runs `x - 1` times, at the start of each iteration, the loop control variable (which is not explicitly named but is controlled by `x`) should reflect the remaining iterations. Since the loop has already completed some iterations, we need to adjust `x` to reflect the remaining iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was at least 2, meaning there were `x - 1` iterations to perform. After each iteration, `x` effectively decreases by 1 implicitly through the loop mechanism, but we need to explicitly adjust our state to reflect this.

So, if we are starting the next iteration, `x` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` is at least 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory where `lst[a]` includes `b` as its last element, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` includes `a` as its last element.**
