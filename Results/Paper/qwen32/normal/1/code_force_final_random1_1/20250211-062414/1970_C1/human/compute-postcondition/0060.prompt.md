You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n. tree is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree with n nodes.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: Queue is empty, current is either target if found, or the last node processed, dist is the shortest distance from start to target if found, otherwise, it is the distance of the last node processed from start.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `bfs` accepts two integer parameters `start` and `target`, representing node indices in a tree, and a parameter `tree` which is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree. The function performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. It returns 0 if the `start` node is the same as the `target` node. If a path is found, it returns the distance (number of edges) from the `start` node to the `target` node. If no path exists between the `start` node and the `target` node, it returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns `dist`, which is the second element of the tuple that was at the front of `queue`.

Case_3: The program returns the distance associated with the current node, which is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue.

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
