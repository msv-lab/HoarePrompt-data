The code snippet `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` modifies the `tmp` variable by assigning it the last element of the list stored in `lst[tmp]`, and then removes that element from the list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
- `t` is an integer equal to 1.
- The next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree.
- The last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed.
- `x` is an integer.
- `y` is an integer.
- `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b, and `lst[z]` contains at least one element.
- `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a.
- `z` is an input integer.
- `tmp` is equal to `z`.
- `one` is False.

After executing the code snippet, `tmp` is updated to the last element of the list `lst[tmp]`, and that element is removed from the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is an integer equal to 1; the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed; `x` is an integer; `y` is an integer; `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b, and `lst[z]` contains at least one element except the last element which was popped; `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is now the last element of the list `lst[z]` before it was popped; `one` is False.**
