Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts two integer parameters `start` and `target`, representing node indices in a tree, and a parameter `tree` which is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree. The function performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. It returns 0 if the `start` node is the same as the `target` node. If a path is found, it returns the distance (number of edges) from the `start` node to the `target` node. If no path exists between the `start` node and the `target` node, it returns -1.**
