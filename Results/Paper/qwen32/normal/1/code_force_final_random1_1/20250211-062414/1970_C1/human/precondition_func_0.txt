n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
