Output State: **Queue is not empty (possibly with one more element), visited set contains all reachable nodes from start including `neighbor`, current is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, dist is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue, and `tree[current]` must have at least one element. `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`.**

Explanation: The `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node, which was not in the set initially. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
