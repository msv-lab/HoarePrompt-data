Output State: **Queue is not empty (possibly with more elements), visited set contains all reachable nodes from start including `neighbor`, current is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, dist is the second element of the queue popped from the queue, and `tree[current]` must have at least one element. `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`. The queue now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` as its last element.**

In simple terms: The queue now has an additional element `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. All other conditions remain the same.
