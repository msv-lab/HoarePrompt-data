You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `n` iterations, with `i` equal to `n`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The string `s` and set `a` reflect the last iteration's input but do not persist beyond the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It checks if the string contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string, depending on whether the original string is already the smallest.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Rearrange the characters of `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`, or report that it's impossible.
- Output "YES" followed by the new string `r` if possible; otherwise, output "NO".

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Checking for Impossibility**:
   - The program checks if the length of the set of characters (`len(a)`) is 2. If so, it outputs "NO".
   - This is because if there are only two distinct characters, any rearrangement will either result in the same string or its reverse, which might still be the same if the counts of both characters are equal (e.g., "aabb" -> "bbaa").

2. **Generating a New String**:
   - If more than two distinct characters exist, the program sorts the string in ascending order (`b`) and descending order (`c`).
   - It then checks if the sorted string (`b`) is the same as the original string (`s`). If they are the same, it prints the reverse-sorted string (`c`); otherwise, it prints the sorted string (`b`).

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The program handles the case where there are only two distinct characters correctly by outputting "NO".
  - However, it does not handle the case where the string has only one character. For example, the string "d" cannot be rearranged to form a different string, so the correct output should be "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct but fails to handle the edge case where the string has only one character. Therefore, it is not fully correct according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the input string has only one character (e.g., "d"). In such cases, it should output "NO" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
