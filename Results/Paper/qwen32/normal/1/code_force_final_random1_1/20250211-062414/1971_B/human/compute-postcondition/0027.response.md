Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the newly input `s`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If the length of `a` is 2, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted version of `s`, and `c` is the sorted version of `s` in reverse order.**
