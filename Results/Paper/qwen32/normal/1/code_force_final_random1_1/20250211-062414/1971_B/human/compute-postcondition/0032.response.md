In the given initial state, several variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, `i`) are described, but the `print` statement only contains the string `'YES'`.

Let's break down the information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a newly input string.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`.
- `i` is 4.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, or `i`.

Output: **YES**
