You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `n` iterations, with `i` equal to `n`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The string `s` and set `a` reflect the last iteration's input but do not persist beyond the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It checks if the string contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string, depending on whether the original string is already the smallest.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step against the problem requirements:

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to determine if we can rearrange the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.
- If such a rearrangement is possible, we should output "YES" followed by the rearranged string.
- If no such rearrangement is possible, we should output "NO".
- The program must handle up to 1000 test cases.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking for Possible Rearrangements:**
   - The program creates a set `a` from the characters of `s`. The length of this set indicates the number of unique characters in `s`.
   - If the length of `a` is 2, it means there are only two distinct characters in the string. In this case, any rearrangement will result in a string that is either identical to `s` or its reverse. Since reversing a string with only two distinct characters will either keep it the same or swap the positions of the two characters, and since swapping the positions of two characters does not change the string if they are repeated equally, it is impossible to create a different string. Hence, the program correctly outputs "NO" in this case.
   - If the length of `a` is greater than 2, the program outputs "YES" because it is always possible to rearrange the characters to form a different string.

3. **Generating a Different String:**
   - If the length of `a` is greater than 2, the program generates two potential rearrangements: `b`, which is the sorted version of `s`, and `c`, which is the reverse-sorted version of `s`.
   - It checks if the sorted version `b` is the same as the original string `s`. If it is, it prints the reverse-sorted version `c`.
   - If `b` is not the same as `s`, it prints `b`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The logic for determining whether a rearrangement is possible is correct.
- The method used to generate a different string when possible is also correct. By sorting the string and checking if it matches the original, the program ensures that it outputs a different string when possible.
- The program handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including strings with only one character and strings with only two distinct characters.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
