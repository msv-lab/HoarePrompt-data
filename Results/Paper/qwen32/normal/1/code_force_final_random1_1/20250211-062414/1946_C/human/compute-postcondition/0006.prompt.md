Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_1` does not take any parameters and its purpose is to read input and call the `solve` function for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
    solve()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0, and `solve()` has been executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: There are `num_iterations - 1` remaining iterations where `num_iterations` is the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and it must be greater than 0, and `solve()` has been executed twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: No changes to the state as the function `solve()` is called but not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
