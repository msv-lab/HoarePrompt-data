You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem described. Let's go through the key problems:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `-1` values, but the precomputation function `func_1` is supposed to fill this array with the number of possible configurations for a given board size.
   - However, `func_1` is called before it is defined, which would result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Use of `invalid` Set**:
   - The `invalid` set is used to track rows and columns that have been occupied by rooks. However, the current implementation adds both `r` and `c` to the same set, which is incorrect because `r` and `c` represent different dimensions (rows and columns).
   - The correct approach would be to maintain separate sets for rows and columns that have been occupied.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Positions**:
   - The calculation of the number of remaining positions (`n - len(invalid)`) is incorrect because it treats rows and columns as a single pool of invalid positions.
   - Instead, the number of available rows and columns should be tracked separately.

4. **Handling of Mirror Moves**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the mirror moves. When a player places a rook at `(r, c)`, the computer places a rook at `(c, r)` unless `r == c`.
   - The program does not account for the fact that once a row or column is occupied, it cannot be used again, even if it was previously unoccupied.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `k = 0` (no initial moves) or when `n = 1` (a 1x1 board).

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Maintain separate sets for occupied rows and columns.
- Calculate the number of remaining rows and columns that can be used for placing rooks.
- Use dynamic programming to precompute the number of possible configurations for different board sizes.
- Correctly handle the mirror moves and ensure that no two rooks attack each other.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
