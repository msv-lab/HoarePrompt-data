The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 3, and the loop body would have incremented `i` by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `dp`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `i` is 4**
