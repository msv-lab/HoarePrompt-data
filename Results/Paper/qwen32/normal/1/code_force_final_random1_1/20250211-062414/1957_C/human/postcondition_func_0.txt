The function `func_1` computes and returns the value of `dp[n]` based on a specific recursive formula, where `dp[i]` is calculated using the values of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`. The function takes an integer `n` as input, with the constraint `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5`, and returns the computed value modulo 1000000007.
