Let's execute the given Python code snippet based on the initial state provided.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n
- Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 7
- `i` is 4

Code snippet:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
```

Given the initial state, we know the values of `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and `dp[3]`. We need to calculate `dp[4]` using the formula provided.

Substituting the known values into the formula:
- `dp[4] = (dp[3] + 2 * (4 - 1) * dp[2]) % 1000000007`
- `dp[4] = (7 + 2 * 3 * 3) % 1000000007`
- `dp[4] = (7 + 18) % 1000000007`
- `dp[4] = 25 % 1000000007`
- `dp[4] = 25`

After executing the code, the value of `dp[4]` is calculated to be 25. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, the moves `r_i` and `c_i`, `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and `dp[3]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `i` is 4**
