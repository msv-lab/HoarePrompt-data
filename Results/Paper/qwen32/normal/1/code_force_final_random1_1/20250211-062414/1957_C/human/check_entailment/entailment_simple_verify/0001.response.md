### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided program. Let's break down the issues and confirm the reasoning:

1. **Recurrence Relation in `func_1`:**
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is used to compute the number of configurations for a board of size `i`. However, this relation does not accurately represent the problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard with some positions already occupied and considering the mirroring rule.
   - The problem requires careful handling of the mirroring rule and the fact that some positions are already occupied by previous moves. The provided recurrence relation does not account for these constraints.

2. **Handling Invalid Positions:**
   - The program uses a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied. While this is a good start, the way the number of configurations is calculated using `dp[n - len(invalid)]` is incorrect because it assumes a simpler problem without considering the mirroring rule and the specific constraints of the problem.

3. **Mirroring Rule:**
   - The problem specifies that the computer mirrors the player's moves unless the move is on the diagonal. This rule significantly affects the number of valid configurations and cannot be captured by the simple recurrence relation provided.

4. **Base Cases and Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` might seem reasonable for small boards, but they do not generalize to larger boards with the additional constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The recurrence relation and the approach to calculating the number of configurations are not appropriate for the problem's constraints and rules.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
