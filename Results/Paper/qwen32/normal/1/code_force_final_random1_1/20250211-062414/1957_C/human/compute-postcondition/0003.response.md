The given code snippet calculates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. The initial values provided are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.

Given the initial state, the code does not specify the range of `i` for which `dp[i]` should be calculated. However, based on the context, we can infer that `dp[i]` needs to be computed for all `i` from 3 up to `n`.

Since the code snippet only provides a single line of calculation for `dp[i]`, we can assume that the loop or mechanism to iterate through `i` is not included in the snippet. Therefore, we will compute `dp[i]` for `i = 3` as an example, and generalize that the same process would apply for higher values of `i` up to `n`.

Let's calculate `dp[3]`:
- `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * (3 - 1) * dp[1]) % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = (3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = (3 + 4) % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = 7`

Following this pattern, `dp[i]` would be calculated for all `i` from 3 to `n`.

However, since the problem asks for the output state after running the given line of code, and without a loop, we can only compute `dp[3]` based on the provided initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7.**
