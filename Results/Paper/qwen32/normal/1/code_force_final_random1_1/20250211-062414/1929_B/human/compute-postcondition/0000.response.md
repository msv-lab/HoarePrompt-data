Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `k` where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 4`n` - 2.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be an integer input from the user, while the conditions for `n` and `k` in the subsequent lines remain unchanged.
