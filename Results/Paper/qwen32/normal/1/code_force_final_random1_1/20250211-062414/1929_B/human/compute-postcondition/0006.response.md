To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the components involved:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable `t` does not directly affect the `print` statement in question, so we can ignore it for this specific calculation.
- `n` and `k` are input integers. The only restriction given about these variables is that \(4 \cdot n - 2 \neq k\).

The `print` statement involves the `ceil` function from the `math` module, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer. The expression inside the `ceil` function is `k / 2`.

Let's denote the result of `k / 2` as `x`. The `ceil(x)` function will return the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`.

Given that `k` is an integer, `k / 2` could be either an integer or a half-integer (e.g., 2.5, 3.5, etc.). The `ceil` function will round up any fractional part to the next whole number.

For example:
- If `k = 4`, then `k / 2 = 2.0` and `ceil(2.0) = 2`.
- If `k = 5`, then `k / 2 = 2.5` and `ceil(2.5) = 3`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Output: **the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(k / 2\)**
