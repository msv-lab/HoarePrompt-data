Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. The function processes each test case and returns a specific result based on the values of `n` and `k`. For each test case, if `k` is within the valid range (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2), the function computes and returns a particular value or result. If `k` is outside this range, the behavior is not specified in the given constraints, but typically such cases would either return an error or a default value.**
