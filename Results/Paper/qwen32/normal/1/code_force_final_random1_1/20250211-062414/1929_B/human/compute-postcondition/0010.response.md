Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `_` is incremented by 1. This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. This variable is also not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `n` and `k` are values read from the input. These values are used in the code snippet.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The expression `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it divides `k` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
- Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` shifts the result up by one.

### Output Description:
The code prints the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the value read from the input)**
