To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each pair of integers `(n, k)` based on the given conditions and how it affects the output.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop Iteration Process**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`. If true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
   - If the condition is false, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

2. **Final Output State**:
   - After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed all pairs of integers `(n, k)`.
   - The variable `_` (which is just a loop counter) will be equal to `t` after the loop completes.
   - The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last iteration, but they do not affect the overall output state since the loop does not retain these values between iterations.
   - The main output will be a series of printed values, one for each iteration, based on the conditions mentioned above.

3. **Formal Output State**:
   - The loop counter `_` will be equal to `t`.
   - The values of `n` and `k` will be those from the last iteration, but they are not part of the final output state as per the problem statement.
   - The output will consist of `t` lines, each containing the result of the computation for the respective `(n, k)` pair.

Given the above understanding, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each pair `(n, k)`, it has printed either `k // 2 + 1` if `k == 4 * n - 2`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise. The loop counter `_` is now equal to `t`.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished processing all `t` test cases, and the output consists of `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of the computation for the respective `(n, k)` pair.
