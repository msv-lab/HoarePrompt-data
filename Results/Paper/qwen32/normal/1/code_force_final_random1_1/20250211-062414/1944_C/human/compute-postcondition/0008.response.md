The value of `start` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`arr`, `nums`, `vis`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1 and `nums[1]` decreased by 1; `start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing the value 0.**
