The code snippet only initializes a variable `start` to 0. No changes are made to `arr` or `nums`. Therefore, the initial conditions for `arr` and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `start` is 0.**
