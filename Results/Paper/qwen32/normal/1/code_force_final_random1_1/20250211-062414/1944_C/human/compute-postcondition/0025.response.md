Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided to determine the value of `start + 1`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`.
- There is at least one 0 in `arr`.
- `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with specific adjustments:
  - `nums[0]` is decreased by 1.
  - `nums[1]` is 1 or more.
  - `nums[2]` is decreased by 1 if `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero.
- `nums[start]` is decreased by 1.
- `start` is determined as follows:
  - If `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero, `start` is set to 2.
  - Otherwise, `start` remains 1.
- `vis` is a set containing the values {0, 1, 2}.

### Determining `start`:
The key to determining `start` is understanding the condition involving `nums[start + 1]`. Since `start` can only be 1 or 2, let's consider both cases:

1. **If `start` were initially 1:**
   - `start + 1` would be 2.
   - If `nums[2]` is non-zero, then `start` would be set to 2.
   - If `nums[2]` is zero, then `start` remains 1.

2. **If `start` were initially 2:**
   - This case is not directly relevant because `start` is initially set to 1 unless `nums[2]` is non-zero, in which case it becomes 2.

Given the conditions, `start` will be 2 if `nums[2]` is non-zero, otherwise, it will remain 1.

### Determining `start + 1`:
- If `start` is 1, then `start + 1` is 2.
- If `start` is 2, then `start + 1` is 3.

However, since `start` is initially set to 1 and only changes to 2 if `nums[2]` is non-zero, we need to consider the possibility of `nums[2]` being non-zero or zero.

### Conclusion:
- If `nums[2]` is non-zero, `start` becomes 2, and `start + 1` is 3.
- If `nums[2]` is zero, `start` remains 1, and `start + 1` is 2.

Since the problem states that the program does not return anything if `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero, it implies that `nums[2]` must be non-zero (otherwise, the program would return None, which contradicts the given information).

Therefore, `start` is 2, and `start + 1` is 3.

### Final Output:
Output: **3**
