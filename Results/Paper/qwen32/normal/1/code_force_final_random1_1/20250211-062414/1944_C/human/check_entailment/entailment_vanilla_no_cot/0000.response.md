Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the MEX of the array `c`, but it does so without considering the optimal moves by Alice and Bob.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Optimal Play**: The code does not simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current implementation simply counts the occurrences of numbers and calculates the MEX without simulating the turns.

2. **Logic for MEX Calculation**: The current logic in `func_1` attempts to find the smallest missing number by decrementing the count of numbers and checking if the next number is present. However, this does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

- Count the occurrences of each number in the array.
- Simulate the game where Alice and Bob make their optimal moves.
- Calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

A correct approach would involve using a greedy strategy where Alice always picks the smallest available number that helps maximize the MEX, and Bob picks the smallest available number to minimize the MEX. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import collections as c

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the occurrences of each number
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    
    mex = 0
    while nums.get(mex, 0) > 0:
        mex += 1
    
    print(mex)
```

This code counts the occurrences of each number and finds the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array, which is the MEX. This approach assumes that the players play optimally, as the problem statement guarantees that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), making this approach feasible.
