The given code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `arr`. This `Counter` object, named `nums`, will count the occurrences of each element in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. After executing the code, `nums` will be a dictionary-like object where keys are the unique elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.**
