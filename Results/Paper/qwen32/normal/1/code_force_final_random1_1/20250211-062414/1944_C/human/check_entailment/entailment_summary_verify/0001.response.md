To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to array `c`.
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- We need to find the final MEX of `c` if both play optimally.

### Key Observations:
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- Alice and Bob are playing optimally, meaning Alice will try to add numbers to `c` that help increase the MEX, while Bob will try to prevent this.

### Strategy:
- Alice should aim to fill the sequence of numbers starting from 0 as much as possible.
- Bob will counter by removing numbers that Alice could use to continue filling the sequence.
- The game essentially revolves around who can control the sequence of numbers in `c`.

### Implementation Analysis:
- The code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in `arr`.
- It then iterates through numbers starting from 0, adding them to `c` if they exist in `arr`.
- If a number `start` exists, it is added to `vis` (though `vis` is not used further), and its count is decremented.
- If `start + 1` also exists, it is added to `c` and its count is decremented, and `start` is incremented.
- If `start + 1` does not exist, the MEX is `start + 1`, and the function prints this value and returns.

### Correctness Verification:
- The algorithm correctly identifies the smallest missing number in `c` after the game ends.
- It ensures that both players play optimally by simulating the process of filling the sequence of numbers starting from 0.
- The logic of decrementing counts and checking for the next number aligns with the optimal strategies for both players.

### Detailed Code Review:
Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

```python
import collections as c

def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        nums[start] -= 1
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
    print(start)
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each number in `arr`.
   - `start` is initialized to 0, representing the current number being checked.
   - `vis` is a set that keeps track of visited numbers, though it is not used further in the logic.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `start` exists in `nums` (i.e., `nums.get(start, 0)` is non-zero).
   - `start` is added to `vis`.
   - The count of `start` in `nums` is decremented.
   - If `start + 1` also exists in `nums`, its count is decremented, and `start` is incremented.
   - If `start + 1` does not exist, the MEX is `start + 1`, and the function prints this value and returns.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `start` no longer exists in `nums`.
   - The MEX is determined to be `start`, and the function prints this value.

### Validation Against Examples:
Let's verify the code against the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `4, [0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Alice and Bob can play such that the final `c` is `[0, 1]`, making the MEX `2`.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `4, [0, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Alice and Bob can play such that the final `c` is `[0, 1, 2]`, making the MEX `3`. However, since Alice and Bob play optimally, Bob can force the MEX to be `1`.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `2, [1, 1]`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Alice and Bob can play such that the final `c` is `[]`, making the MEX `0`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the final MEX of `c` when both players play optimally. The function `func_1` accurately determines the smallest missing number in `c` after the game ends, aligning with the optimal strategies for both players.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
