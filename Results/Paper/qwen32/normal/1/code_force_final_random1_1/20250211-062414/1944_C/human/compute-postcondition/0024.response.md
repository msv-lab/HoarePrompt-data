Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1, `nums[1]` is 1 or more, `nums[start]` is decreased by 1, and `nums[start + 1]` is decreased by 1; `start` is 3 if `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero, otherwise `start` remains 2; `vis` is a set containing the values 0, 1, and 2.**

Explanation: The value of `start` is incremented by 1. Initially, `start` is 2 if `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero, otherwise `start` remains 1. After the increment, `start` becomes 3 if it was initially 2, or `start` remains 2 if it was initially 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
