To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head:

```python
while nums.get(start, 0):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue as long as `nums[start]` is greater than 0. Given the current state:

- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`.
- `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1 and `nums[1]` decreased by 1.
- `start` is 1.
- `vis` is a set containing the value 0.

We need to ensure that `nums[start]` (which is `nums[1]` given that `start` is 1) is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

From the description, `nums[1]` has already been decreased by 1. Therefore, to ensure that `nums[1]` is still greater than 0, it must have been at least 2 before the decrement.

So, the state needs to be adjusted such that `nums[1]` is at least 2 before the decrement, meaning `nums[1]` should be 2 or more initially.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1 and `nums[1]` initially being 2 or more; `start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing the value 0**
