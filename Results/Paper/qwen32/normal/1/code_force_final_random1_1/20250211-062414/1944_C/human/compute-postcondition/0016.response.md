Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1, `nums[1]` is 1 or more, and `nums[2]` is decreased by 1; `start` is 2; `vis` is a set containing the values 0 and 1.**

Explanation: The value of `start` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
