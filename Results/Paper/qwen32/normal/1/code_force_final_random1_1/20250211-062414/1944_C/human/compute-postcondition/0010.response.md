Let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`arr`**: A list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. There is at least one 0 in `arr`.
2. **`nums`**: A `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`. The count of 0 (`nums[0]`) is decreased by 1.
3. **`start`**: Initialized to 0.
4. **`vis`**: A set containing the value 0.
5. **`nums.get(start + 1, 0)`**: This evaluates to 0, meaning there are no occurrences of the value `start + 1` in `nums`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(start + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
- **`start`**: It is explicitly initialized to 0.
- **`start + 1`**: Since `start` is 0, `start + 1` evaluates to 1.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of `start + 1`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
