### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Game Dynamics**: Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c` (in Alice's case) or simply removing them (in Bob's case). Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
2. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best possible moves at each step to achieve their respective goals.
3. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Analysis of the Program:
- The program reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array `arr` itself.
- It then calls `func_1(arr)` to compute the result for that test case.
- Inside `func_1(arr)`, it uses `collections.Counter` to count occurrences of each number in `arr`.
- It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited numbers.
- The while loop continues as long as `start` exists in `nums` (the counter).
- Inside the loop, it adds `start` to `vis` and decrements its count in `nums`.
- If `start + 1` also exists in `nums`, it decrements its count and increments `start`.
- If `start + 1` does not exist, it prints `start + 1` and exits the function.
- If the loop completes without finding a missing number, it prints `start`.

#### Correctness of the Logic:
- The program effectively tracks the smallest missing number (`start`) in the array `arr` by decrementing counts and checking the next number.
- By decrementing counts of `start` and `start + 1` alternately, it simulates the optimal play where Alice picks `start` and Bob picks `start + 1` whenever possible.
- The first time it encounters a number that cannot be followed by `start + 1`, it correctly identifies `start + 1` as the MEX.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
