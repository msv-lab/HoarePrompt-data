Let's analyze the provided Python code to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to array `c`.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - We need to find the final MEX of `c` if both play optimally.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - Since Alice and Bob are playing optimally, Alice will try to add numbers to `c` that help increase the MEX, while Bob will try to prevent this.

3. **Strategy:**
   - Alice should aim to fill the sequence of numbers starting from 0 as much as possible.
   - Bob will counter by removing numbers that Alice could use to continue filling the sequence.
   - The game essentially revolves around who can control the sequence of numbers in `c`.

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through numbers starting from 0, adding them to `c` if they exist in `arr`.
   - If a number `start` exists, it is added to `vis` (though `vis` is not used further), and its count is decremented.
   - If `start + 1` also exists, it is added to `c` and its count is decremented, and `start` is incremented.
   - If `start + 1` does not exist, the MEX is `start + 1`, and the function prints this value and returns.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the smallest missing number in `c` after the game ends.
   - It ensures that both players play optimally by simulating the process of filling the sequence of numbers starting from 0.
   - The logic of decrementing counts and checking for the next number aligns with the optimal strategies for both players.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the final MEX of `c` when both players play optimally. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
