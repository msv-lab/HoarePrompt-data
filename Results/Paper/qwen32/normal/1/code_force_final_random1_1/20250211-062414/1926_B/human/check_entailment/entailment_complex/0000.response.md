### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program and compare it against the requirements specified in the problem statement.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Square**: Consists of `k` (k > 1) consecutive rows where each row has `k` consecutive '1's, and these '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.
2. **Triangle**: Consists of `k` (k > 1) consecutive rows where the `i-th` row has `2*i-1` consecutive '1's, and the central '1's are located in one column. An upside-down triangle is also valid.

#### Program Logic:
1. The program reads `t` test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and the `n x n` grid.
3. It collects the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'.
4. If the count of '1's in the first row (`k[0]`) is equal to the count of '1's in the second row (`k[1]`), it prints "SQUARE".
5. Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

#### Analysis:
- **Square**: In a square, every row with '1's will have the same number of '1's, which is `k`. Therefore, if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are the same, it is likely a square.
- **Triangle**: In a triangle, the number of '1's in each row increases or decreases by 2 as we move up or down the triangle. Hence, the counts of '1's in the first two rows will be different unless `k = 2`, but even then, the pattern of '1's will not match the square's uniformity.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
- The program only checks the first two rows to determine the shape. This approach fails in cases where the triangle or square starts later in the grid or where the triangle has more than two rows with the same number of '1's (which can happen in an upside-down triangle).

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
000
010
111
```
Here, the counts of '1's in the rows that contain '1's are `[1, 3]`. According to the program, this would be classified as a "TRIANGLE". However, this is actually a "SQUARE" if we consider the full grid context.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all possible configurations of triangles and squares as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is flawed because it makes a determination based solely on the first two rows, which is insufficient to accurately classify the shape in all cases.

**Correctness: False**
