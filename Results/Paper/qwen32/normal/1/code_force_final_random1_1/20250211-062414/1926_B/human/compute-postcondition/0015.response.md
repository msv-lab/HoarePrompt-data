Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `b` is the user's input; if '1' is in `b`, then `k` is `[1, 1, b.count('1')]`; otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.**
