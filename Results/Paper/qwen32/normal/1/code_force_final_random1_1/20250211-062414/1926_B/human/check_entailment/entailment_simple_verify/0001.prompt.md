You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.

    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):

    #State: `i` is equal to `a`; `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each of the input strings `b` that contain '1's in the last iteration; `b` is the last input string processed by the loop. If the count of '1's in the first input string `b[0]` is equal to the count of '1's in the second input string `b[1]` in the last iteration, then `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`. Otherwise, the count of '1's in `b[0]` is not equal to the count of '1's in `b[1]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Square Definition**: 
   - A square consists of `k` rows, each containing `k` consecutive `1`s.
   - All `1`s are aligned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

2. **Triangle Definition**:
   - A triangle consists of `k` rows, where the `i-th` row contains `2*i-1` consecutive `1`s.
   - The `1`s are centered in a single column.
   - An upside-down triangle is also valid.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and then reads `n` lines of the grid.

2. **Counting `1`s**:
   - For each row that contains at least one `1`, the program counts the number of `1`s in that row and appends this count to the list `k`.

3. **Determining Shape**:
   - If the counts of `1`s in the first two rows (`k[0]` and `k[1]`) are equal, the program outputs "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "TRIANGLE".

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Square**:
   - The program only checks if the counts of `1`s in the first two rows are equal. This is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square.
   - A square requires that all rows (not just the first two) have the same number of `1`s, and these `1`s must be aligned at an equal distance from the left edge.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Triangle**:
   - The program does not correctly identify triangles.
   - A triangle requires that the number of `1`s in each row follows the pattern `2*i-1` for some `i`, and the `1`s must be centered in a single column.
   - The program does not check for this pattern or the centering condition.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the provided problem description.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
