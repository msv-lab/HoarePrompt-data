Given the initial state, the variable `t` represents the number of test cases, `n` is the dimension of the grid, `grid` is an `n x n` list of strings consisting of '0's and '1's forming either a triangle or a square, `a` is a positive integer, `k` is a list of counts of '1's from each test case that contained at least one '1', `b` is the last input string processed, and `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`.

The `print('TRIANGLE')` statement directly outputs the string `'TRIANGLE'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `grid`, `a`, `k`, or `b`.
- It simply outputs the string `'TRIANGLE'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **TRIANGLE**
