Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem according to the given requirements.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads the grid itself, line by line.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each line in the grid, it checks if there is at least one '1'. If so, it counts the number of '1's in that line and appends this count to the list `k`.

3. **Determining Shape:**
   - After processing all lines in a test case, the code checks if the counts of '1's in the first two lines (`k[0]` and `k[1]`) are equal.
     - If they are equal, it prints "SQUARE".
     - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Square Detection:**
  - For a square, every row that contains '1's will have the same number of '1's. Therefore, checking if `k[0] == k[1]` can be a valid check for the first two rows of a square.
  - However, this logic alone is insufficient because a triangle can also have the same number of '1's in its first two rows (for example, a triangle with `k=3` will have 1 '1' in the first row and 3 '1's in the second row, but an upside-down triangle with `k=3` will have 3 '1's in the first row and 1 '1' in the second row).

- **Triangle Detection:**
  - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row increases or decreases by 2 as you move down or up the triangle.
  - The provided code does not account for this pattern. It only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not sufficient to distinguish between a square and a triangle.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly identify whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the problem's requirements. It only checks the equality of the number of '1's in the first two rows, which is not a reliable method for distinguishing between the two shapes.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
