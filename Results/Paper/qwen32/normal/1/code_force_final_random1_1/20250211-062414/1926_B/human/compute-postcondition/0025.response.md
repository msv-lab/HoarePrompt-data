Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `k` is an empty list; `b` is the value of the last input string processed by the loop; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and `i < a`; the input to the loop must be a positive integer; `b` is now the new input string.**
