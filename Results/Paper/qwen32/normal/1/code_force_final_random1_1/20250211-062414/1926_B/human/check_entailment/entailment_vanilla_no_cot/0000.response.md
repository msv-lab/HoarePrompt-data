Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the criteria given in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Square Detection**: The program checks if the first two counts of '1's in the rows are equal to determine if the shape is a square. This is not sufficient because a square can have more than two rows with the same count of '1's, and the count alone does not guarantee that the '1's are aligned in a square shape.

2. **Triangle Detection**: The program assumes that if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are not equal, then the shape must be a triangle. However, this is not accurate either because the shape could be a triangle with more than two rows, and the counts of '1's will vary according to the triangle pattern.

3. **Triangle Pattern Check**: The program does not check if the '1's form a triangle pattern, which requires checking if the number of '1's in each row increases (or decreases) by 2 for each subsequent row and that they are centered around a central column.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- For a square, verify that all rows with '1's have the same count of '1's and that these '1's are aligned in a square.
- For a triangle, verify that the number of '1's in each row follows the pattern of a triangle (either increasing or decreasing by 2 for each subsequent row) and that they are centered around a central column.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_square(grid, n):
    ones_count = None
    for row in grid:
        count = row.count('1')
        if count > 0:
            if ones_count is None:
                ones_count = count
            elif ones_count != count:
                return False
    return ones_count is not None and ones_count > 1

def is_triangle(grid, n):
    top = None
    bottom = None
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        count = row.count('1')
        if count > 0:
            if top is None:
                top = i
            bottom = i
    if top is None or bottom is None:
        return False
    k = bottom - top + 1
    if k <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(k):
        count = grid[top + i].count('1')
        expected = 2 * (i + 1) - 1
        if count != expected:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        if is_square(grid, n):
            print("SQUARE")
        elif is_triangle(grid, n) or is_triangle(grid[::-1], n):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")

func()
```

This program correctly identifies whether the shape is a square or a triangle by checking the specific patterns required for each shape.
