### Reasoning

The problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. The beauty formula simplifies to the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array because all intermediate terms cancel out.

The provided program follows these steps:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
3. Sorts the array.
4. Computes and prints the difference between the last (maximum) and the first (minimum) elements of the sorted array.

The annotations confirm that the array is sorted and the difference between the maximum and minimum elements is printed, which aligns with the simplified beauty formula.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program's logic matches the problem's requirements and concludes that the program is correct.
