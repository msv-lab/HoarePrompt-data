Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
