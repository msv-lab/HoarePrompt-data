The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. The initial state specifies that `n` was already an integer between 2 and 100. After executing this line, `n` will take on the new value provided by the input, which could be any integer, but we should assume it remains within the bounds specified (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) as per the precondition.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `ntest`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100); `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `ntest` must be greater than 0**.
