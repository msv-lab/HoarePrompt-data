The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common placeholder for a loop counter when the loop variable is not used within the loop body. Since `_` is incremented automatically with each iteration of the loop, the only state that needs adjustment is `_` itself.

Given that the loop runs `q` times, at the start of each iteration, `_` should be the current iteration count starting from 0 up to `q-1`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `data`, `t`, `idx`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, `x` remain the same. `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`. `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` contains an additional element `'YES'`. Otherwise, `results` has `'NO'` appended to it.

Since `_` is the loop counter and it gets incremented automatically, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1.
