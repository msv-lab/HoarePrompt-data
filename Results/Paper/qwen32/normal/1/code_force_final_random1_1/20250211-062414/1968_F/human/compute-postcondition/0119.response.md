Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line such that `data[idx - 3 - n]` is a positive integer, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2 - n]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3 - n]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first `n` elements are integers from `data` starting at the position `idx - n - 2` up to `idx - 3`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element from index `1` to `n` contains the prefix XOR value, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `x` is calculated as the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
