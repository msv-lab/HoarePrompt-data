The given code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method. This means that `data` will now contain the input values as strings.

Since the initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `q`, and the elements of `a` are integers, and `l` and `r` are part of the queries, we can infer that the first element of `data` will be `t`. However, the subsequent elements depend on the current test case being processed, which includes `n`, `q`, and the elements of `a`.

Given that the code only reads and splits the input without processing it further, the output state will reflect the new value of `data` as a list of strings, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged in terms of their described properties.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; the array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30; each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
