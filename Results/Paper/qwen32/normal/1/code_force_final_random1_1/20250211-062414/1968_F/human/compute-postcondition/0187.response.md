To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n` (inclusive).
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.
3. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

No other variables in the loop head (`n`) need to be adjusted because they are constants for the duration of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `n` is at least 1, `q` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `idx` is calculated as `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2 + 2`, `results` is a list containing `q + q + 2` elements, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[2]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[2]` which is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, and `mp[pf[2]]` is now `[2]`, `i` is 3**
