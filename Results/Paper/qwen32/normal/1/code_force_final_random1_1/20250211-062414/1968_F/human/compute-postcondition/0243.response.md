Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` is `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2 + n + 2 * q`, `results` contains `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration based on the conditions specified, `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs.`**

### Explanation:
- **`data` and `t`**: These remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`idx`**: Initially set to `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2 + n`, it increases by 2 for each iteration of the loop. After `q` iterations, `idx` will be `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2 + n + 2 * q`.
- **`results`**: This list accumulates either `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions checked inside the loop for each iteration.
- **`n` and `q`**: These remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`a` and `pf`**: These are initialized once before the loop starts and do not change during the loop iterations.
- **`mp`**: This map is also initialized before the loop starts and does not change during the loop iterations.

Each iteration of the loop checks specific conditions related to the values of `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` to append either `'YES'` or `'NO'` to the `results` list.
