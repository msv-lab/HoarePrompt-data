Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (the first element in `data`), `idx` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is `{0: [0]}`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings where `data[2]` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]` (which must be at least 1); `q` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[4])` has the value `[5]` appended to its list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings where `data[2]` is an integer value greater than or equal to 6; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is 6; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]` (which must be at least 6); `q` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])` and `a[6]` which is `int(data[5])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])` and `pf[6]` which is `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[4])` has the value `[5]` appended to its list and the key `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])` has the value `[5, 6]`; `i` is 6.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings where `data[2]` is an integer value greater than or equal to 6; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is 7; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]` (which must be at least 6); `q` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])`, `a[6]` which is `int(data[5])`, and `a[7]` which is `int(data[6])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])`, `pf[6]` which is `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])`, and `pf[7]` which is `(int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])) ^ int(data[6])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[4])` has the value `[5]` appended to its list and the key `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])` has the value `[5, 6]` and the key `(int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])) ^ int(data[6])` has the value `[5, 6, 7]`; `i` is 7.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
