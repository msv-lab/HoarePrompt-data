Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[2]` is an integer value greater than or equal to 6; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is 6; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]` (which must be at least 6); `q` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])` and `a[6]` which is `int(data[5])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])` and `pf[6]` which is `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[4])` has the value `[5]` appended to its list. If `pf[i]` (which is `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])`) is not in `mp`, then `mp` is updated to include the key `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])` with the value `[]`. `i` is 6.**
