To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the description, we know that at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` was incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

So, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 from its current value.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
- The current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not explicitly stated, but we know it was used to update `a` and `pf`.
- Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, we need to increase `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`data`, `t`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 4`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Since `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we need to reflect that in the state:

State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 4`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`, `i` is now `i + 1`.**
