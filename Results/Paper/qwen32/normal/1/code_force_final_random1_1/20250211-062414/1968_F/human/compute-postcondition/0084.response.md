The given code appends an empty string to the `results` list. This means that the length of the `results` list increases by one, and the last element of `results` is now an empty string.

Here's the updated state:

- `data` remains a list of strings split from the input line.
- `t` remains an integer value greater than 0.
- `idx` remains `n + 4 + 2 * q`.
- `results` now contains `q + 1` elements, with the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being an empty string `''`.
- `n` remains the integer value of `data[2]`.
- `q` remains an integer value greater than 0.
- `a` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `pf` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `mp` remains a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `q` is an integer value greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key.**
