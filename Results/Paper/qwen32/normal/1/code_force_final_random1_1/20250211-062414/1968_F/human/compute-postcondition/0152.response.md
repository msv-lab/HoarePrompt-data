Output State: **`q` is `q + 1`; `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `idx` is `idx + 2`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `x` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. The values of `q`, `l`, `r`, and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial state.
