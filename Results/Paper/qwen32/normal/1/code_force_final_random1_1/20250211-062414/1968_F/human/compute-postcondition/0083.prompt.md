Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 4`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 6`; `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'` twice if `x` equals 0 and the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, otherwise `results` contains the string `'YES'` once if `x` equals 0, or `'NO'` if the condition is false; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `q` is an integer value greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[n + 5]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 8`; `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'` three times if `x` equals 0 and the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, otherwise `results` contains the string `'YES'` twice if `x` equals 0, or `'NO'` followed by `'YES'` if the condition is false and the else part is executed, or just `'NO'` if the condition is false and `x` does not equal 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `q` is an integer value greater than 0 minus 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 10`; `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'` four times if `x` equals 0 and the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, otherwise `results` contains the string `'YES'` three times if `x` equals 0, or `'NO'` followed by `'YES'` and then `'YES'` if the condition is false and the else part is executed, or `'NO'` followed by `'YES'` if the condition is false and `x` does not equal 0, plus an additional `'YES'` if the condition is true, or an additional `'NO'` if the condition is false; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `q` is an integer value greater than 0 minus 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
