The code appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 10`; `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'` four times if `x` equals 0 and the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, otherwise `results` contains the string `'YES'` three times if `x` equals 0, or `'NO'` followed by `'YES'` and then `'YES'` if the condition is false and the else part is executed, or `'NO'` followed by `'YES'` if the condition is false and `x` does not equal 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `q` is an integer value greater than 0 minus 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; `q` is `q - 1`.**
