The code snippet provided updates the value of `l` to be the integer value of `data[idx]`. This means the previous value of `l` is replaced by the new value obtained from `data[idx]`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `data` remains a list of strings split from the input line.
- `t` remains an integer value greater than 0.
- `idx` remains `n + 8`.
- `results` remains a list containing the string `'YES'` three times if `x` equals 0 and the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, otherwise `results` contains the string `'YES'` twice if `x` equals 0, or `'NO'` followed by `'YES'` if the condition is false and the else part is executed, or just `'NO'` if the condition is false and `x` does not equal 0.
- `n` remains the integer value of `data[2]`.
- `q` remains an integer value greater than 0 minus 1.
- `a` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `pf` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `mp` remains a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key.
- `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- `r` remains the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
- `x` remains `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
- `v1` remains `mp.get(pf[r], [])`.
- `v2` remains `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.
- `it1` remains the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order.
- `it2` remains `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.
- `q` remains `q - 1`.
