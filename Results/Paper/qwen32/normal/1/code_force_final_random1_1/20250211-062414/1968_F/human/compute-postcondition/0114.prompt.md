Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`); `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 2`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is `{0: [0]}`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 3`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, and `mp[pf[i]]` includes `i` in its list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 4`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 5`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 5]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the value `i` appended to its list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
