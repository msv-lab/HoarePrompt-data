Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[2]` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]` (which must be at least 1), `q` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[4])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is `{0: [0]}`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
