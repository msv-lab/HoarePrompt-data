Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line such that `int(data[idx - 2])` (which is `n`) is at least 1 and `int(data[idx - 1])` (which is `q`) is greater than 0. `t` is an integer value greater than 0. `idx` is calculated as `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2 + 1`. `results` is a list containing `q + q + 2` elements. `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`. `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`. `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, and `mp` now contains `{(0): [0]}`. Additionally, `pf[i]` is not in `mp`.**
