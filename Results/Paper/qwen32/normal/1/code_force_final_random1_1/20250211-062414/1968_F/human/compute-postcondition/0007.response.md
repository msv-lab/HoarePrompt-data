The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx + 1]` to the variable `q`. Given that `idx` is 2, `q` will be assigned the integer value of `data[3]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (the first element in `data`), `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[3]`.**
