Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `idx` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is now set to the integer conversion of the first element in the `data` list. The `idx` variable is incremented by 1, reflecting that the first element has been processed. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
