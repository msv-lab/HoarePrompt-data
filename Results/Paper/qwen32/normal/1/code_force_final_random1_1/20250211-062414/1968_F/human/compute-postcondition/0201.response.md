Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` is `3 * n + 4 * q + 8`, `results` now contains `'YES'`, `n` remains the same, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `x` is equal to 0.**

In natural language: The only change is that the string `'YES'` has been appended to the `results` list. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
