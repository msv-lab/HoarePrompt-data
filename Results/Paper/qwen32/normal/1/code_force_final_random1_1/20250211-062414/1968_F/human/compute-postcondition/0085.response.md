The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Since `_` does not hold any specific state that needs to be preserved or modified between iterations, the state of `_` itself does not change. However, the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Given that `t` is an integer value greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`); `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `q` is an integer value greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key.**
