The code snippet assigns the integer value of the element at index `idx` in the list `data` to the variable `n`. Given that `idx` is 2, `n` will be the integer representation of `data[2]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (the first element in `data`), `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**
