The code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. None of the other variables (`q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`) are modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`q` is `q + 1`; `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `idx` is `idx + 2`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` includes `'YES'` appended to it.**
