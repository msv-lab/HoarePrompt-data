To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the components involved:

1. **`data`**: This is a list of strings that have been split from an input line. The specific contents of this list are not provided, but it is mentioned that it is a list of strings.

2. **`t`**: This is an integer value representing the number of iterations, and it is specified that `t` is greater than 0.

3. **`idx`**: This is described as the final index pointing to the end of the `data` list. While `idx` is defined, it is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.

4. **`results`**: This is a list that contains `q + 1` elements for each of the `t` iterations. For each iteration, the first `q` elements are either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element is an empty string `''`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

This statement joins all the elements of the `results` list into a single string with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). 

Since `results` contains `q + 1` elements for each of the `t` iterations, and the last element of each set of `q + 1` elements is an empty string, the output will consist of sequences of `'YES'` and `'NO'` followed by an empty line for each iteration.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose `t = 2` and for each iteration, `q = 3`, then `results` might look like this:
```python
results = ['YES', 'NO', 'YES', '', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO', '']
```

Joining these elements with `\n` would result in:
```
YES
NO
YES

NO
YES
NO
```

Thus, the output will be a series of `'YES'` and `'NO'` statements, each iteration ending with an empty line.

Output: **a series of 'YES' and 'NO' statements, each iteration ending with an empty line (where each iteration consists of q 'YES'/'NO' statements followed by an empty string)**
