The only variable in the loop head is `prob`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `prob` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `freq` is a list where one of the elements from index 0 to 6 is incremented by 1.
- `missing` is calculated as `7m - k` if `m > k` else `6m`.
- `t`, `test_cases`, `results` remain unchanged.
- `n` is the first element of `test_cases[_]`.
- `m` is the second element of `test_cases[_]`.
- `a` is the third element of `test_cases[_]` and must have at least one element.
- `_` is incremented by 1.

Since `prob` is the current element being processed in the list `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `prob` should be the next element in the list `a`.

Let's denote the current value of `prob` as `a[j]`. After the current iteration, `j` would have been incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `prob` should be `a[j+1]`.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `j`, we can only say that `prob` should be the next element in the list `a` relative to its current value.

State: **`freq` is a list where one of the elements from index 0 to 6 is incremented by 1, `missing` is 7m - k if m > k else 6m, `t`, `test_cases`, `results` remain unchanged, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[_]`, `m` is the second element of `test_cases[_]`, `a` is the third element of `test_cases[_]` and must have at least one element, `_` is incremented by 1, `prob` is the next element in the list `a`**
