The code appends the value of `missing` to the list `results`. The value of `missing` is given as `7m - 6`. Since no other variables are modified, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`freq` is [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3]; `missing` is 7m - 6; `results` contains the element `7m - 6`; `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `a`, and `_` remain unchanged.**
