### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program to see if it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
2. **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts `n`, `m`, and `a`.
3. **Frequency Calculation**: It creates a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (representing the 7 difficulty levels 'A' to 'G'). It then counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a` and stores them in the corresponding index of `freq`.
4. **Calculate Missing Problems**: For each difficulty level, it calculates how many more problems are needed to meet the requirement of having at least `m` problems of that level. This is done using the expression `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` in `freq`. The sum of these values gives the total number of additional problems needed for that test case.
5. **Store Result**: The calculated number of missing problems is appended to the `results` list.
6. **Return Results**: After processing all test cases, the function returns the `results` list.

### Checking Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n=10`, `m=1`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
- Frequency of difficulties: `B=3`, `G=2`, `E=2`, `C=1`, `D=2`
- Missing problems: `A=1`, `F=1` (since `m=1` and we have 0 problems of levels 'A' and 'F')
- Total missing: `2`
- Output: `2`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n=10`, `m=2`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
- Frequency of difficulties: `B=3`, `G=2`, `E=2`, `C=1`, `D=2`
- Missing problems: `A=2`, `F=2`, `C=1` (since `m=2` and we have less than 2 problems of levels 'A', 'F', and 'C')
- Total missing: `5`
- Output: `5`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `n=9`, `m=1`, `a='BBCDEFFGG'`
- Frequency of difficulties: `B=2`, `C=1`, `D=1`, `E=1`, `F=2`, `G=2`
- Missing problems: `A=1` (since `m=1` and we have 0 problems of level 'A')
- Total missing: `1`
- Output: `1`

All the test cases match the expected outputs, indicating that the program is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
