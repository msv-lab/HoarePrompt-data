You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` calculates and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. Each test case consists of a number of existing problems (`n`), a number of upcoming rounds (`m`), and a string representing the difficulties of the existing problems. The result for each test case indicates how many more problems are needed to ensure that for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', there are at least `m` problems available.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds.
   - Each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - Vlad has `n` problems in his bank with varying difficulty levels.
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can hold `m` rounds.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, and the string `a`).
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (representing the counts of problems for each difficulty level 'A' to 'G').
   - It then iterates through the string `a` and updates the frequency array accordingly.
   - The calculation `max(0, m - f)` determines how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level `f` in the frequency array. This ensures that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level.
   - The sum of these values gives the total number of additional problems needed for the current test case.
   - The results for all test cases are stored in a list and returned.

3. **Verification Against Example Input:**
   - For the first test case (`n=10`, `m=1`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`):
     - Frequency count: `[0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
     - Additional problems needed: `(1-0) + (1-2) + (1-1) + (1-2) + (1-1) + (1-2) + (1-2) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1` for each difficulty level that is less than `m`.
     - Total additional problems: `2` (for 'A' and 'F').
   - For the second test case (`n=10`, `m=2`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`):
     - Frequency count: `[0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
     - Additional problems needed: `(2-0) + (2-2) + (2-1) + (2-1) + (2-2) + (2-1) + (2-2) = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5`.
   - For the third test case (`n=9`, `m=1`, `a='BBCDEFFGG'`):
     - Frequency count: `[0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`
     - Additional problems needed: `(1-0) + (1-2) + (1-1) + (1-1) + (1-1) + (1-2) + (1-2) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1` for each difficulty level that is less than `m`.
     - Total additional problems: `1` (for 'A').

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the provided example input and the logic explained above.
