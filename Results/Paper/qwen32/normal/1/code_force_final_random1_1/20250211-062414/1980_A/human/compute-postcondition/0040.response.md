Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (where 1 <= t <= 1000), and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three elements: an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) representing the length of a string, an integer `m` (1 <= m <= 5), and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element corresponds to the missing value calculated for each test case.**
