Output State: **`freq` is [0, k, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `missing` is 7m - k if m > k else 6m; `t`, `test_cases`, `results` remain unchanged; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two elements of `test_cases[_]`; `a` is updated to the third element of `test_cases[_]`; `results` now includes `missing`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `results` list now includes the value of `missing`, which is calculated as `7m - k` if `m > k` else `6m`. All other variables retain their initial states or updated states as specified.
