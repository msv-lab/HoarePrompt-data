Output State: **`n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15, `x` is 2, `y` is 4. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is increased by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `y` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding `cnt` is still applicable based on the new value of `y`.
