To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is:
```
(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 6.
- `m` must be at least 3.
- `x` is 2.
- `y` is 2.
- `cnt` is incremented by 1 since `gcd(2, y) == 1`.

First, let's calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` with the current values of `x` and `y`:
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`

Now, let's check the conditions:
- `8 <= n` (since `n` must be at least 6, this condition is satisfied).
- `8 <= m` (since `m` must be at least 3, this condition is not satisfied).

Since `8 > m` (assuming `m` is exactly 3 as per the minimum requirement), the loop cannot execute again with the current values of `x` and `y`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 8. There is no need to adjust `n` because it already satisfies the condition. We can keep `x` and `y` as they are since adjusting them would require more information about how `x` and `y` change within the loop body, which is not provided.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified such that `m` is at least 8.

State: **`n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 since `gcd(2, y) == 1`**.
