To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the conditions under which the loop continues to execute and how the variables change with each iteration.

### Initial Conditions:
- `n` ≥ 1
- `m` is an integer
- `x` = 1
- `cnt` = 0
- `y` = 1

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as both `(x + y) * x ≤ n` and `(x + y) * y ≤ m`.

### Loop Body:
- If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, increment `cnt` by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
- Increment `y` by 1.

### Iteration Analysis:
- **First Iteration**: 
  - `y` starts at 1 and increments to 2.
  - Check if `(1 + 2) * 1 ≤ n` and `(1 + 2) * 2 ≤ m` → `3 ≤ n` and `6 ≤ m`.
  - If `gcd(1, 2) == 1` (which is true), increment `cnt` by `min(n / 3, m // 6)`.

- **Second Iteration**:
  - `y` increments to 3.
  - Check if `(1 + 3) * 1 ≤ n` and `(1 + 3) * 3 ≤ m` → `4 ≤ n` and `12 ≤ m`.
  - If `gcd(1, 3) == 1` (which is true), increment `cnt` by `min(n / 4, m // 12)`.

- **Third Iteration**:
  - `y` increments to 4.
  - Check if `(1 + 4) * 1 ≤ n` and `(1 + 4) * 4 ≤ m` → `5 ≤ n` and `20 ≤ m`.
  - If `gcd(1, 4) == 1` (which is true), increment `cnt` by `min(n / 5, m // 20)`.

The loop will continue until either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`.

### Final Output State:
The loop terminates when `y` reaches a value such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. Given that `x` remains 1 throughout the loop, the loop will terminate when `y` is such that `y * (y + 1) > m` or `(y + 1) > n`.

The final `cnt` will be the sum of all valid increments where `gcd(x, y) == 1`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state is dependent on the values of `n` and `m`. However, given the initial conditions and the loop logic, the final state can be described as:

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `m` remains the same, `x` remains 1, `y` is the smallest integer such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, and `cnt` is the sum of all valid increments where `gcd(x, y) == 1`.**

In simpler terms, `n` and `m` stay unchanged, `x` stays 1, `y` stops incrementing when the loop condition fails, and `cnt` accumulates the count based on the GCD condition.
