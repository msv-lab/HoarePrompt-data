Output State: **`n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 15, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is 3. Since `math.gcd(x, y)` equals 1, the program does not change any of these variables except `y`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `y` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `math.gcd(x, y)` equals 1 is still valid since `math.gcd(3, 2)` equals 1.
