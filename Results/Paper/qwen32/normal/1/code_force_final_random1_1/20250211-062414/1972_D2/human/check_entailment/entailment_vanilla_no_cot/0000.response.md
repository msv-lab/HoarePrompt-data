Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down why:

1. **Logic Error**: The core logic of the function `func_1` is flawed. The condition `(b * gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0` is not properly checked in the loop. The current implementation checks if `gcd(a, b) == 1` and then counts pairs based on a division operation, which doesn't align with the problem statement.

2. **Loop Conditions**: The loops in `func_1` do not correctly iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the bounds `[1, n]` and `[1, m]`. The condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` is too restrictive and misses many valid pairs.

3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The counting mechanism inside the loop is incorrect. It attempts to count pairs using a division operation, but this does not accurately reflect the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if they satisfy the condition `(b * gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0`. Given the constraints, an efficient approach might involve precomputing some values or using mathematical insights to reduce the number of operations, but the provided code does not follow this approach.

Here is a corrected version of the code that directly checks each pair:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

main()
```

This code iterates through all pairs `(a, b)` and checks if they satisfy the condition, which is straightforward but might be slow for very large `n` and `m`. For the given constraints, optimizations would be necessary, but this version at least correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
