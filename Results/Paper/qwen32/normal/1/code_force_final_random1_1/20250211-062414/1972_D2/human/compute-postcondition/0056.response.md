Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and `cnt` have specific values:

- `n = 100`
- `m = 100`
- `x = 11`
- `y = 10`
- `cnt = 27`

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print(cnt)
```

This code simply prints the value of the variable `cnt`.

Based on the initial state, the value of `cnt` is explicitly given as 27.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `cnt`.

Output: **27**
