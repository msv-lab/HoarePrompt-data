### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: Handles a single test case.
- `func_2()`: Reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Detailed Examination of `func_1()`:
1. **Initialization**: `x = 1`, `cnt = 0`.
2. **Reading Input**: `n, m = map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Outer Loop**: Iterates while `x * x <= n`.
4. **Inner Loop**: Iterates while `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
5. **Condition Check**: If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Loop Structure**: The loops do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). They only consider pairs where `x` and `y` satisfy specific conditions (`x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`), which is not sufficient to cover all pairs \((a, b)\).
2. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is too restrictive. The problem requires checking if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) for all pairs \((a, b)\).
3. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The way `cnt` is incremented does not match the problem's requirement to count valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) holds. This can be done using nested loops for `a` and `b`.

#### Annotations Evaluation:
The annotations provided indicate the state of the program at certain points but do not reflect the correctness of the logic. Specifically, the annotation `State: n = 100, m = 100, x = 11, y = 10, cnt = 27.` does not align with the expected output for the given inputs, indicating that the logic is flawed.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
