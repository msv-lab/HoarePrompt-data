Let's break down the given code snippet and calculate the new state.

Given:
- `n` must be at least 6.
- `m` must be at least 8.
- `x` is 2.
- `y` is 2.
- `cnt` is incremented by 1 since `gcd(2, y) == 1`.

Code snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

First, let's calculate the expressions inside the `min` function:
- `(x + y) * x` evaluates to `(2 + 2) * 2 = 8`.
- `(x + y) * y` evaluates to `(2 + 2) * 2 = 8`.

So the expression becomes:
- `n / 8` and `m // 8`.

Since `n` must be at least 6, the smallest possible value for `n / 8` is `6 / 8 = 0.75`.
Since `m` must be at least 8, the smallest possible value for `m // 8` is `8 // 8 = 1`.

Thus, `min(n / 8, m // 8)` will be `min(0.75, 1)`, which is `0.75`. However, since `m // 8` involves integer division, the actual smallest possible value is `1`.

Therefore, `cnt` will be incremented by `1`.

Given that `cnt` was already incremented by 1 previously, the new value of `cnt` will be `cnt + 1 + 1 = cnt + 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `cnt` is incremented by 2.**
