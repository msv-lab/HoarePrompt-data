Let's first determine the value of `cnt` before the given operation:

- `cnt` is initially calculated based on the conditions provided:
  - If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is the sum of the smaller of `n / 2` and `m // 2`, and the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`.
  - Otherwise, `cnt` is simply the smaller of `n / 2` and `m // 2`.

Given `x` is 1 and `y` is 3, the gcd of `x` and `y` is 1. Therefore, we need to compute both parts of the `cnt` calculation:

1. Smaller of `n / 2` and `m // 2`:
   - `n / 2` is `n / 2`
   - `m // 2` is `m // 2`
   - Let `smaller_part` be `min(n / 2, m // 2)`

2. Minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`:
   - `n / 3` is `n / 3`
   - `m // 6` is `m // 6`
   - Let `additional_part` be `min(n / 3, m // 6)`

So, `cnt` is initially `smaller_part + additional_part`.

Next, we need to compute the increment to `cnt`:

- The increment is `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`
- Given `x` is 1 and `y` is 3, `x + y` is 4.
- Therefore, the increment is `min(n / (4 * 1), m // (4 * 3))` which simplifies to `min(n / 4, m // 12)`.

Finally, the new value of `cnt` is `cnt + min(n / 4, m // 12)`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is the initial `cnt` (which is `min(n / 2, m // 2) + min(n / 3, m // 6)` if gcd(x, y) is 1, otherwise `min(n / 2, m // 2)`) plus `min(n / 4, m // 12)`**.
