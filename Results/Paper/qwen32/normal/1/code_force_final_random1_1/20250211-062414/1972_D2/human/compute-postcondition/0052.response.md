The code increments the value of `y` by 1. Given the initial state, `y` was 3, so now `y` becomes 4. The values of `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the operation `y += 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 18, `m` must be at least 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 4, and `cnt` is 4 if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 3.**
