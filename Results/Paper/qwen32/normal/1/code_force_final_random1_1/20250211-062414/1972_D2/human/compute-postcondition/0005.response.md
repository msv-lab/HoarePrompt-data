In this case, the loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use, and `t` is the number of iterations the loop should perform.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and the loop has just completed an iteration. This means that the loop variable `_` would have been incremented implicitly by the `range` function.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

- The loop variable `_` is incremented automatically by the `range` function each time the loop iterates. Since the loop has just finished an iteration, `_` would have been incremented from its previous value.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations as it represents the total number of iterations the loop should perform.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body (as indicated by the underscore), we don't need to worry about its specific value other than knowing that it has been incremented.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will take on the next value in the sequence generated by `range(t)`, and `t` will remain the same.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
