Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 4, and `cnt` is the smaller of `n / 2` and `m // 2`. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is increased by the smaller of `n / 4` and `m // 12`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `y` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
