You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: n = 100, m = 100, x = 11, y = 10, cnt = 27.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 27
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, then calculates and prints the count of certain pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are positive integers, `gcd(x, y) = 1`, and the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The loop has executed `t` times, and no further changes to `t` or any other variables occur.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then executes `func_1` exactly `t` times. No specific results are returned or modified; the focus is on processing each test case through `func_1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function seems to be designed to handle a single test case.
- `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Function `func_1()`:
- It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
- It reads `n` and `m` from the input.
- It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` with the condition `x * x <= n`.
- For each pair `(x, y)`, it checks if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

#### Issues in `func_1()`:
- The logic inside the nested loops does not correctly address the problem requirements.
- The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is too restrictive. The problem requires checking if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) for all pairs \((a, b)\).
- The way `cnt` is incremented does not match the problem's requirement to count valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) holds. This can be done using nested loops for `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
