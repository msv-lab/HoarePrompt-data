### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1()` and `func_2()`. Here's how they work:

1. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads the values of `n` and `m`.
   - Initializes `cnt` to count the number of valid pairs.
   - Iterates through possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each `x`, iterates through possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
   - Prints the count of valid pairs after processing all possible `x` and `y`.

#### Issues with the Code:
- The logic inside `func_1()` does not correctly implement the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The code uses `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` which doesn't accurately count the valid pairs. This formula seems to be an attempt to count pairs but does not correctly handle the condition involving the gcd and the sum.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is divisible by \(a + b\). Given the constraints, a direct approach iterating through all pairs might be too slow, so optimizations or mathematical insights are necessary.

However, the provided code does not follow this approach and instead uses a flawed formula to count pairs, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
