The code increments the value of `y` by 1. Given the initial state, `y` was 2, so now `y` becomes 3. The conditions for `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the increment operation on `y`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 15, `m` is at least 15, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is 4 if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 3.**
