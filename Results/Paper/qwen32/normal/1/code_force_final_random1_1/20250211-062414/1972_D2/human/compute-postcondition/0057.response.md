It appears there's a slight discrepancy in the provided example since the function definition `def func_1():` does not include any parameters, but the parameter constraints mention `n` and `m`. I'll assume the function should accept these parameters based on the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The functionality of the function is not fully specified in the given output, but based on the constraints, it processes these integers and returns a result accordingly.**
