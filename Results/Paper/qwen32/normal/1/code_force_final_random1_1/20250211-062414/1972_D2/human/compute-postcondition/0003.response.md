The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. Since `_` is typically used as a counter that increments with each iteration, we can infer that `_` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` remains unchanged, but `_` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration to proceed.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and `_` is incremented by 1**.

Since the specific value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration isn't provided, we can only describe the change needed. Assuming `_` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it would now be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. However, without knowing `x`, we simply note that `_` is incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**. (With the understanding that `_` has been incremented by 1 for the next iteration.)
