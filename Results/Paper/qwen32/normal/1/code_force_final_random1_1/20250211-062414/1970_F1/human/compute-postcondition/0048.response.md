The given code snippet assigns a value to the variable `tmp` based on the first character of the string `line[ind]`. Specifically, if the first character is 'B', `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, it is set to 1.

Given the initial state, we know that `line[ind]` is not '..' and not a player, and its second character is 'G'. However, the first character of `line[ind]` can be either 'B' or something else (since it's not specified further). Based on this, `tmp` will be either 0 or 1.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, with `elements[line[ind]]` updated to `(3, ind)`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()` and must have at least one element; `i` is 3; `line[ind]` is not '..' and `line[ind]` is not a player; the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G'; `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
