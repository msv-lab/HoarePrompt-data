The given code snippet assigns the value of `tmp` based on the first character of `line[ind]`. Since `ind` is 5, the value of `tmp` will be determined by `line[5][0]`.

If `line[5][0]` is 'B', `tmp` will be 0. Otherwise, `tmp` will be 1.

Given the initial state, no other variables are modified except `tmp`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, with `elements[line[4]]` updated to `(3, 4)` if `line[4]` is not '..', and `elements[line[5]]` updated to `(3, 5)`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team, with `goal[tmp]` including `(3, 4)` if `line[4]` is not a player and its second character is 'G'; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()` and must have at least one element; `i` is 3; `ind` is 5; `tmp` is 0 if `line[5][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
