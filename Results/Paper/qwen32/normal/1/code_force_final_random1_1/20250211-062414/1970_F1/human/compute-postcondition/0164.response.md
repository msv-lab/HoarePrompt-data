Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in any `line` to its position `(i, ind)` for all `i` in `range(n)` and `ind` in `range(len(line))`. If the length of `command` is 3, `allPlayers` maps each player in any `line` to `False` except `obj` which is mapped to `True` if `el` is '.Q', otherwise `allPlayers` maps each player in any `line` to `False`. Additionally, if `el` is '.S', `points` is updated to [10, 0] if `team` is 0, or [0, 10] if `team` is 1. If the length of `command` is not 3, `elements['.B']` is updated to `nxt` if `obj` is '.B' and the move is valid. `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in any `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0] unless modified as described; `line` is the last read list of strings from input, `elements` maps each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, `goal` includes tuples for all goal markers in `line`, categorized by team; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `command` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the stripped input line; `time` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `pos` is the position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary; `nxt` is the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player or `obj` is a player and `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj` is not '.B' or the conditions for `obj` are not met, and `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `points` is incremented by 1 for the respective team. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is -1, `points` remains unchanged. If `com` is not 'T' and `obj` is a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` and `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `obj` is not a player and `com` is not 'T', none of these variables are modified.**
