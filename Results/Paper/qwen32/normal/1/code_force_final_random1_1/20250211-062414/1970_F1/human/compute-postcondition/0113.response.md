Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in any `line` to its position `(i, ind)` for all `i` in `range(n)` and `ind` in `range(len(line))`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in any `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team; `points` is a list of two integers [10, 0] if `team` is 0, or [0, 10] if `team` is 1; `line` is the last read list of strings from input, `elements` maps each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` maps each player in `line` to `False`, `goal` includes tuples for all goal markers in `line`, categorized by team; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `command` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the stripped input line, and the length of `command` is 3; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `el` is the third element of `command` and `el` is equal to '.S'; `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `points[team]` has been incremented by 10. If `team` was 0, then `points` is now [10, 0]. If `team` was 1, then `points` is now [0, 10]. All other variables remain unchanged.
