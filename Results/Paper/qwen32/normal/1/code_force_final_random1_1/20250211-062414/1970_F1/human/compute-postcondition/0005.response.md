Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from input, representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both n and m are odd; `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping strings to tuples of integers representing the positions of entities on the field, and now `elements` is {'B': (-1, -1)}; `allPlayers` is a dictionary (now empty); `goal` is a list of two empty lists; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams respectively, and now `points` is [0, 0].**

Natural Language: The dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`) remain unchanged. The `grid` remains an empty list. The `elements` dictionary still contains only the key 'B' with the value (-1, -1). The `allPlayers` dictionary remains empty. The `goal` list still consists of two empty lists. The `points` list has been updated to [0, 0], representing the initial scores of the red and blue teams.
