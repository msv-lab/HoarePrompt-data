Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a list of strings (`line`). `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in any `line` to its position `(i, ind)` for all `i` in `range(n)` and `ind` in `range(len(line))`. If the length of `command` is 3, `allPlayers[obj]` is `True` and all other players in `allPlayers` are `False` unless `el` is '.S', in which case `points` is updated to [10, 0] if `team` is 0, or [0, 10] if `team` is 1. If the length of `command` is not 3 and `obj` is '.B', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in any `line` to `False`. `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team. `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0] unless modified as described. `line` is the last read list of strings from input, `goal` includes tuples for all goal markers in `line`, categorized by team; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `command` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the stripped input line; `time` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `obj`, `com`, and `el` are the first, second, and third elements of `command`, respectively; `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0. `pos` is the position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary; `nxt` is the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is not '.B', none of these variables are modified.**
