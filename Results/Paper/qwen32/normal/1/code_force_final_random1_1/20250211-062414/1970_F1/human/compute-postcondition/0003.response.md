Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from input, representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both n and m are odd; `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping strings to tuples of integers representing the positions of entities on the field, and now `elements` is {'B': (-1, -1)}; `allPlayers` is a dictionary (now empty); `goal` is a list of lists of tuples of integers representing the positions of goals for each team; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams respectively.**

Explanation: The variable `allPlayers` was initially a dictionary mapping player identifiers to boolean values indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle. After executing the line `allPlayers = {}`, `allPlayers` is now an empty dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged.
