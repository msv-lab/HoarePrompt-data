The provided code snippet reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, converts these parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the input.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are already integers within the range 3 to 99 and both are odd, the new values of `n` and `m` will replace the old ones. However, no other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from input, representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both n and m are odd; `grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the field, where each string is either ".." for an empty cell, "R0" to "R9" or "B0" to "B9" for players, "RG" or "BG" for goals, or ".Q" for the Quaffle; `elements` is a dictionary mapping strings to tuples of integers representing the positions of entities on the field; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping player identifiers to boolean values indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle; `goal` is a list of lists of tuples of integers representing the positions of goals for each team; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams respectively.**
