The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. This means that the list at the index `tmp` in the `goal` dictionary will now include the new tuple `(i, ind)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`line` must have at least one element, and the element at index `ind` is not '..'. `line[ind]` is not a player. The current value of `line[ind][1]` is 'G'. `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`. `tmp` is either 0 or 1. `goal[tmp]` includes the additional element `(i, ind)`.**
