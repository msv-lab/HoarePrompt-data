Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in any `line` to its position `(i, ind)` for all `i` in `range(n)` and `ind` in `range(len(line))`. If `el` is '.S', `points` is updated to [10, 0] if `team` is 0, or [0, 10] if `team` is 1. If `el` is not '.S', `points` remains unchanged. `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in any `line` to `False` except `obj` which is mapped to `True` if `el` is '.Q'. `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team; `line` is the last read list of strings from input, `elements` maps each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, `goal` includes tuples for all goal markers in `line`, categorized by team; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `command` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the stripped input line; `time` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `obj`, `com`, and `el` are the first, second, and third elements of `command`, respectively; `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.**
