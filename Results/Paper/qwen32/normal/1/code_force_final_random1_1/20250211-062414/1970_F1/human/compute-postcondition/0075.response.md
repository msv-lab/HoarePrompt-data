The code assigns a tuple `(i, ind)` to the key `line[ind]` in the dictionary `elements`. This means that the value associated with the key `line[ind]` in the dictionary `elements` is now the tuple `(i, ind)`. The preconditions about `line` having at least one element and the element at index `ind` not being '..' remain unchanged.

Output State: **`line` must have at least one element, and the element at index `ind` is not '..'; `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`**.
