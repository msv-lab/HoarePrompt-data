Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is the list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()`; `i` is 3.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, with `elements[line[ind]]` updated to `(3, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team, with `goal[tmp]` including `(3, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G'; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()` and must have at least one element; `i` is 3. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to `(3, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', `goal[tmp]` includes `(3, ind)`, where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, with `elements[line[4]]` updated to `(3, 4)` if `line[4]` is not '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team, with `goal[tmp]` including `(3, 4)` if `line[4]` is not a player and its second character is 'G'; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()` and must have at least one element; `i` is 3; `ind` is 4. If `line[4]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[4]]` is set to `False`. If `line[4]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes `(3, 4)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[4][0]` is 'B' else 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, with `elements[line[4]]` updated to `(3, 4)` if `line[4]` is not '..', and `elements[line[5]]` updated to `(3, 5)` if `line[5]` is not '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team, with `goal[tmp]` including `(3, 4)` if `line[4]` is not a player and its second character is 'G'. If `line[5]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[5]]` is set to `False`. If `line[5]` is not a player and `line[5][1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` also includes `(3, 5)`. `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()` and must have at least one element; `i` is 3; `ind` is 5; `tmp` is 0 if `line[5][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If `line[5]` is '..', none of these updates occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
