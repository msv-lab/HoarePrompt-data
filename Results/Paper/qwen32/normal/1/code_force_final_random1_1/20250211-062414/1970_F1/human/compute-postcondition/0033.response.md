The given code snippet appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial state, `tmp` is either 0 or 1, and `ind` is 2. Therefore, the tuple `(i, 2)` will be appended to either `goal[0]` or `goal[1]`.

Let's break down the changes:

- If `tmp` is 0, `goal[0]` will now include the tuple `(i, 2)`.
- If `tmp` is 1, `goal[1]` will now include the tuple `(i, 2)`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary with the values {'B': (-1, -1), `line[1]`: (i, 1) if `line[1]` is not '..', `line[2]`: (i, 2)}; if `isPlayer(line[1])` is True, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the value `{line[1]: False}`; if `isPlayer(line[1])` is False and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 1)`; if `isPlayer(line[1])` is False and the second character of `line[1]` is not 'G', `goal` remains a list of two empty lists. Additionally, if `line[1][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1. `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings with at least one string; `ind` is 2; `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 2)`**.
