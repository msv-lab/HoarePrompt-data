Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, with `elements[line[ind]]` updated to `(3, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team, with `goal[tmp]` including `(3, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G'; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()` and must have at least one element; `i` is 3. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to `(3, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', `goal[tmp]` includes `(3, ind)`, where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
