The only variable in the loop head is `ind`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ind` and the length of `line`. If `ind` is less than the length of `line`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ind` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must still be less than the length of `line`.

State: **`line` must have at least one element, `ind` is `ind + 1`** 

Since we know `ind` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to ensure that `ind` is still within the bounds of `line`. Let's assume `ind` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, so now `ind` is `k + 1`. For the loop to continue, `k + 1` must be less than the length of `line`.

State: **`line` must have at least `ind + 1` elements, `ind` is `ind + 1`**

To make it clear, if `ind` was 3 at the end of the last iteration, now `ind` is 4, and `line` must have at least 5 elements for the loop to execute again.

So the final adjusted state is:

State: **`line` must have at least `ind + 1` elements, `ind` is `ind + 1`**
