The given code snippet only updates the value of `cur_ss` by calculating the difference between the ASCII values of `ss` and `'a'`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `cur_ss` is updated to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. This means `cur_ss` now holds the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet (assuming `ss` is a lowercase letter).

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input, `s` is a non-empty string provided as input, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur` is unchanged, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**.
