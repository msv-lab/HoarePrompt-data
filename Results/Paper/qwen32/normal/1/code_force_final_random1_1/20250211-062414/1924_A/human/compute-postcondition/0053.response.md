The code snippet `ans += tmp` concatenates the current value of `tmp` to the end of `ans`. Since `tmp` is initially an empty string (`''`), the value of `ans` does not change after this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000; i is k; n, k, m remain the integers provided as input; s remains the string provided as input; cnt is the number of times k unique characters were found consecutively in s and cnt is less than n; cur is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters; ans contains the last character of each sequence of k unique characters; tmp is ''.**
