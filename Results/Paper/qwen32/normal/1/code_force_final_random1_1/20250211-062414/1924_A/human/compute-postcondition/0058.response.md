The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. This affects the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` remains the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters; `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by 'a' repeated (`n - cnt - 1`) times.**
