The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` was an empty string, and after executing the code, `ans` will be equal to `ss`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is a non-empty string provided as input; `cnt` is 1; `cur` is 0; `ans` is `ss`; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**
