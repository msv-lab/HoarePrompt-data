Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `cur` remains either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1` depending on the last set of characters, and `ans` contains the accumulated characters `ss` when `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is set to `k-1`, `tmp` is `'a'`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + 'a' + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.**
