Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 2; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s` and is less than `n`; `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset; `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is `'c'`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It only exits the current loop or if statement. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values, and we note that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
