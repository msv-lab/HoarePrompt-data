Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; `cur` is either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1` depending on the last set of characters; `ans` contains the accumulated characters `ss` when `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`.**
