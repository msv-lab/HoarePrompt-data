The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `tmp` with an empty string. This action does not affect the values of any existing variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`). The only change is the introduction of `tmp` with an empty string.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`; `cur` is either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1` depending on the last set of characters; `ans` contains the accumulated characters `ss` when `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`; `tmp` is an empty string.**
