Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is 0 if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged, `ans` includes `ss` at the end if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet.**
