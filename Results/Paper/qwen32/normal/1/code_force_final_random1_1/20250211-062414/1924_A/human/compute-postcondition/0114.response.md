The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The initial state mentions that `i` is incremented by 1, but since `i` is not used or modified in the given code snippet, its state remains unchanged.

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` will be set to the integers provided in the input. The output state will reflect these new assignments.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` are the integers read from the input.**
