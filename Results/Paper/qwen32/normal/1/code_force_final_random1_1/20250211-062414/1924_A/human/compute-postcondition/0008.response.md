The given code snippet calculates the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of `'a'`, and assigns this difference to `cur_ss`. However, the variable `ss` is not defined in the initial state, which means there's a missing variable. Assuming `ss` is intended to be `s[cur]` (the character at the current index of the string `s`), we'll proceed with that assumption.

Given this assumption, `cur_ss` will be calculated as the position of the character `s[cur]` in the alphabet (0-indexed).

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[cur]) - ord('a')`**

In natural language: The variable `cur_ss` is now assigned the value of the position of the character at index `cur` in the string `s` within the alphabet, starting from 0 for 'a'. All other variables retain their initial values.
