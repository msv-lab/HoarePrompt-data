The `print('NO')` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
