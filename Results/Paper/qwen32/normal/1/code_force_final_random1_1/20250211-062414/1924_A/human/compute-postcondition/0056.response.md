Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\). `i` is 0 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k`. `n`, `k`, `m` remain the integers provided as input. `s` remains the string provided as input. `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s`. `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters. `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by 'a' repeated (`n - cnt - 1`) times.**
