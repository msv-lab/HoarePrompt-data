The given Python code snippet initializes a new variable `tmp` with an empty string. This action does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`). 

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the addition of the new variable `tmp`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is `k + 1` since `cnt` is less than `n`; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s` and is less than `n`; `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset; `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is an empty string.**
