Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is incremented by `2^cur_ss` if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains unchanged, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `cnt` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
