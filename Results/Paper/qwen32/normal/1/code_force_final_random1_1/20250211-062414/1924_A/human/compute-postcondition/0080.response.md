Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\). If `cur` equals \((1 << k) - 1\), then `i` is 1 if `cnt + 1` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to include `ss`. If `cur` does not equal \((1 << k) - 1\), `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged.**
