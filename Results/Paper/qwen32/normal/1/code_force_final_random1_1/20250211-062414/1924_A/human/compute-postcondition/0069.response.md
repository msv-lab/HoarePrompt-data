Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is a non-empty string provided as input; `cnt` is 1; `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`; `ans` is an empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
