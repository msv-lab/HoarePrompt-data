The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the character `ss` to the string `ans`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `ans` is unchanged before this operation. After appending `ss` to `ans`, the new value of `ans` will include `ss` at the end of its current value.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `i` is 1 if `cnt + 1` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input, `s` is a non-empty string provided as input, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `ans` is the original `ans` plus `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**
