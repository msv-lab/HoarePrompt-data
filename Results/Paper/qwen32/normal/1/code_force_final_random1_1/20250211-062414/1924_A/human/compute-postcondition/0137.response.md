The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ss` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not part of the loop head, it's mentioned for context).
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `s` is a non-empty string read from the input.
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.
- `cur` is reset to 0 if it was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `ans` includes `ss` at the end if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`. 

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `ss` was the character at position `j` in the string `s`. For the next iteration, `ss` should be the character at position `j + 1`.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` (the character at position `j + 1`), `cur` is 0 if it was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous iteration; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous iteration; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `ans` includes `ss` at the end if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous iteration; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `j`, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` (the character following the previous `ss`), `cur` is 0 if it was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous iteration; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous iteration; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `ans` includes `ss` at the end if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous iteration; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet**.
