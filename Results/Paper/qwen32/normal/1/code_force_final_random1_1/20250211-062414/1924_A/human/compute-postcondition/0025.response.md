To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just `ss` since it is the variable being iterated over in the `for` loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for ss in s:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here's the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5
- `i` is 0
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `m` is the third integer from the input
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s`
- `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(ss) - ord('a')`
- If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`
- If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is the string `ans` concatenated with `ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was the current character being processed. For the next iteration, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Let's denote the current character as `s[j]` where `j` is the index of the current character. Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, the next character will be `s[j+1]`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and their values depend on the logic inside the loop, they remain unchanged for the purpose of determining the start of the next iteration based solely on the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`**.
