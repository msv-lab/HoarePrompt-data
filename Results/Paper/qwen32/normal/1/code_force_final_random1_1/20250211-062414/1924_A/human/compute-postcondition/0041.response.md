The code snippet assigns to `tmp` the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `tmp` will be assigned the character 'a'.

Here's the updated state of the variables after the execution of the code:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\)
- `i` is 0 (unchanged)
- `n`, `k` remain the integers provided as input with `k` greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `m` remains the integer provided as input (unchanged)
- `s` remains the string provided as input (unchanged)
- `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n` (unchanged)
- `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters with the `i`-th bit not set (unchanged)
- `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters (unchanged)
- `tmp` is now 'a'

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 0; `n`, `k` remain the integers provided as input with `k` greater than 0; `m` remains the integer provided as input; `s` remains the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`; `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters with the `i`-th bit not set; `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is 'a'**
