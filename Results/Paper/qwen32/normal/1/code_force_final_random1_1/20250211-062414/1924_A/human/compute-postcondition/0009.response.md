Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[cur]) - ord('a')`, and `(cur & 1 << cur_ss) == 0`**
