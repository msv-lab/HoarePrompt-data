The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by adding `1` shifted left by `cur_ss` bits to its current value. Given that `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25, this operation effectively sets the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` to 1.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `ss` is the next element in the list `s`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans` remain unchanged, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**.
