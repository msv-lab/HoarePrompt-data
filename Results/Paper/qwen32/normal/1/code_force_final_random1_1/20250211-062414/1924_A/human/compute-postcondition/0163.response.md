Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`. If `cur & (1 << i) == 0`, then `tmp` is set to 'c' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp` or the control flow.**
