The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp` by converting the ASCII value of 'a' plus the value of `i` to its corresponding character. Given that `i` is 2, `tmp` will be assigned the character 'c' (since 'a' is 97 in ASCII, and 97 + 2 = 99 which corresponds to 'c').

The values of the other variables (`k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is 'c'**.
