Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string. `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, indicating that all the first `k` bits are set to 1. `cur_ss` is `ord(s[cur]) - ord('a')`.**
