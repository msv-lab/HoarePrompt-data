The given code snippet resets the variable `ans` to an empty string. This means that any previous value stored in `ans` is discarded, and `ans` now holds no characters.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is the new string provided as input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0; `ans` is an empty string.**
