Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, where `n` and `k` are between 1 and 26, and `m` is between 1 and 1000. It also receives a string `s` of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Based on these inputs, the function performs some computation and returns a result for each test case.**
