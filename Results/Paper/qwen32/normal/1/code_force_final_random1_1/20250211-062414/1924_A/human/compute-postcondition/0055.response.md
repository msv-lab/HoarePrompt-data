To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000.
- `i` is set to `k`.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided as input.
- `s` is a string provided as input.
- `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `cur` is either 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters.
- `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters plus the character `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.
- `tmp` is an empty string.

Given these conditions, the variable `ans` is constructed based on the sequences of `k` unique characters found in the string `s`. Since `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` will include the last character of each complete sequence of `k` unique characters followed by the character `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.

### Explanation of `ans`:
- `ans` includes the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters found in `s`.
- Since `cnt < n`, there are still some remaining positions to be filled in `ans` to reach the length `n`. These remaining positions are filled with the character `'a'`.

### Example Scenario:
Suppose `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and the string `s` contains sequences of `k` unique characters such that `cnt = 2` (meaning two sequences of `k` unique characters have been found). In this case, `ans` would contain the last character of each of these two sequences, followed by `'a'` repeated `(5 - 2 - 1) = 2` times.

### General Case:
In general, if `cnt` sequences of `k` unique characters have been found, `ans` will contain the last character of each of these sequences, followed by `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the constructed string `ans` which includes the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters found in `s`, followed by `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.

Output: **ans (where ans contains the last character of each sequence of k unique characters found in s, followed by 'a' repeated (n - cnt - 1) times)**
