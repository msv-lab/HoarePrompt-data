The given code snippet initializes a new variable `tmp` with an empty string. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`). Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `tmp` with an empty string value.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` remains 0; `n`, `k`, `m` remain the integers provided as input; `s` remains the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s`, and `cnt` is less than `n`; `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters; `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is an empty string.**
