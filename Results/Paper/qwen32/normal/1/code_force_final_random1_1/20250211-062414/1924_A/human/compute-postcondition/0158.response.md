Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`. If `cur & 1 << i` equals 0, then `cur` remains unchanged and `tmp` is set to `'a'`, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string and `cur` remains unchanged. `ans` contains the accumulated characters `ss` when `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`. `tmp` is 'b' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values except for the fact that the loop or if statement is exited.
