The given code snippet modifies the value of `cur` by adding `1 << cur_ss` to it. Here's the updated state:

- `i` is still incremented by 1 (from the initial state).
- `n`, `k`, and `m` remain integers read from the input.
- `s` remains a non-empty string read from the input.
- `ss` remains the next character in the string `s`.
- `cur` is now `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`.
- `cnt` remains incremented by 1 if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous iteration; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `ans` includes `ss` at the end if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous iteration; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `cur_ss` remains the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous iteration; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `ans` includes `ss` at the end if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous iteration; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet.**
