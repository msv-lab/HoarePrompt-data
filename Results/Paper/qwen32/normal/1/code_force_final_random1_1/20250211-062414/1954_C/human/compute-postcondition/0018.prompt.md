Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`; `i` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input line with at least one element; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line with at least one element, and `b[0]` is equal to `a[0]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is `a[0]`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` which is `a[0]`; `i` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `b` is a list of integers with at least two elements, and `b[0]` is equal to `a[0]` and `b[1]` is equal to `a[1]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is `a[0]` and `new[1]` which is `a[1]`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` which is `a[0]` and `new2[1]` which is `a[1]`; `i` is 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `a` is a list of integers with at least three elements; `b` is a list of integers with at least three elements, and `b[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, `b[1]` is equal to `a[1]`, and `b[2]` is equal to `a[2]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is `a[0]`, `new[1]` which is `a[1]`, and `new[2]` which is `a[2]`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` which is `a[0]`, `new2[1]` which is `a[1]`, and `new2[2]` which is `min(a[2], b[2])`; `i` is 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
