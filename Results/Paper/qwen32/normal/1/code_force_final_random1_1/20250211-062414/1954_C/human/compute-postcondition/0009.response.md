The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input line with at least one element; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line with at least one element, and `b[0]` is equal to `a[0]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is `a[0]`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` which is `a[0]`; `i` is 1.**
