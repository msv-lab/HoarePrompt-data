The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so after the operation, `i` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and having the same length, `b` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line with `b[0]` equal to `a[0]`, `b[1]` equal to `a[1]`, and `b[2]` equal to `a[2]`, `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line with `len(a)` greater than 2, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new[1]` which is `max(a[1], b[1])`, and `new[2]` which is `max(a[2], b[2])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` which is `min(a[0], b[0])`, `new2[1]` which is `min(a[1], b[1])`, and `new2[2]` which is `min(a[2], b[2])`, the number of remaining iterations is one less than before, `i` is 3`.**
