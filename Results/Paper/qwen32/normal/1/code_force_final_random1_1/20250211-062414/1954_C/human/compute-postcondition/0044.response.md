Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`; `i` is equal to 0; `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line.**
