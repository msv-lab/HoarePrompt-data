Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, x and y have the same length for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, list(input())))
    b = list(map(int, list(input())))
    new = [None] * len(a)
    new2 = [None] * len(a)
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    if i != len(a):
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
        while i < len(a):
            new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `new` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the corresponding element in `a` (or `b`), except `new[i]` which is `min(a[i], b[i])` for all valid indices `i` if `i` was not equal to the length of `a` (or `b`); `new2` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the corresponding element in `a` (or `b`), except `new2[i]` which is `max(a[i], b[i])` for all valid indices `i` if `i` was not equal to the length of `a` (or `b`); `i` is equal to the length of `a` (or `b`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and having the same length; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line. If `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, then `new` is a list of integers where `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `0 ≤ j < len(a)` and `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `0 ≤ j < len(a)`. If `i` is equal to `len(a)`, then `new` and `new2` remain as lists of `None` values except `new[j]` and `new2[j]` which are `min(a[j], b[j])` and `max(a[j], b[j])` respectively for all `j` where `0 ≤ j < i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `x`, `y`, `b`, and `a` remain unchanged. `new` has `max(a[i], b[i])` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond that point. `new2` has `min(a[i], b[i])` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond that point. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the number of remaining iterations is non-zero, indicating that the loop has not completed all its iterations. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the number of remaining iterations is zero, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
