Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `new` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the corresponding element in `a` (or `b`), except `new[i]` which is `min(a[i], b[i])` for all valid indices `i`; `new2` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the corresponding element in `a` (or `b`), except `new2[i]` which is `max(a[i], b[i])` for all valid indices `i`; `i` is equal to the length of `a` (or `b`).`**

### Explanation in Natural Language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, every element in the list `new` will be the minimum of the corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b`. Similarly, every element in the list `new2` will be the maximum of the corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the lists `a` and `b`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in these lists. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
