Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[j]` which is `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `0 ≤ j ≤ i-1` and `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[j]` which is `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `0 ≤ j ≤ i-1` and `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`; `i` is 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line with length greater than 1; `new2[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`.**

Explanation: The value of `new[i]` has been updated to `min(a[i], b[i])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
