Output State: **`t` remains unchanged; `x` remains unchanged; `y` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `new` will have `min(a[i], b[i])` at index `i` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond; `new2` will have `max(a[i], b[i])` at index `i` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond the point where `a[i] != b[i]`; `i` is decremented by 1 to ensure `i < len(a)`**

Explanation: The value at index `i` of `new2` is updated to be the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
