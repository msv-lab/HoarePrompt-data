Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and having the same length, `b` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line with `b[0]` equal to `a[0]` and `b[1]` equal to `a[1]`, `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line with `len(a)` greater than 1, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is `max(a[0], b[0])` and `new[1]` which is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` which is `min(a[0], b[0])` and `new2[1]` which is `min(a[1], b[1])`, the number of remaining iterations is one less than before, `i` is 2**.

In simple terms, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
