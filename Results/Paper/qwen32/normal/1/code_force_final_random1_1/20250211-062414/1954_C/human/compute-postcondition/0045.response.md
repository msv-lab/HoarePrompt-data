To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `i < len(a)`
2. `a[i] == b[i]`

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `x` and `y` have the same length.
- `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line.
- `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`.
- `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`.
- `i` is equal to 0.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line.

Let's break down the requirements:
- For the first condition (`i < len(a)`), since `i` is 0, this condition will be true as long as `len(a)` is greater than 0.
- For the second condition (`a[i] == b[i]`), since `i` is 0, this condition will be true if the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `b`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to make sure that:
1. `len(a)` is greater than 0 (which is already ensured by the problem constraints).
2. The first elements of `a` and `b` are equal.

Since `a` and `b` are lists of integers derived from the input lines, we can adjust the first elements of these lists to ensure they are equal.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line with `b[0]` equal to `a[0]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`; `i` is equal to 0; `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line.**
