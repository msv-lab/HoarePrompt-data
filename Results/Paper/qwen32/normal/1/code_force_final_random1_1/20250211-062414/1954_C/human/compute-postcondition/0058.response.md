Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[j]` which is `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `0 ≤ j < i`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[j]` which is `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `0 ≤ j < i`; `i` is the smallest index where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and `i` is not equal to `len(a)`; `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line.**
