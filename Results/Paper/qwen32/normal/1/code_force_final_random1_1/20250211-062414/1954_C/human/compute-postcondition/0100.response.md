The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged; `x` and `y` remain unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `new` will have `max(a[i], b[i])` at index `i` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond; `new2` will have `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond the point where `a[i] != b[i]`; the number of remaining iterations is zero because the loop has completed all its iterations; `i` is the index where `a[i] != b[i]` or `n` if all elements are equal, incremented by 1; `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, indicating that there is at least one index where `a[i] != b[i]`; `new2[i]` is `a[i]` (or equivalently `b[i]`).**
