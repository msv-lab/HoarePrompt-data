### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

**Problem Analysis:**
- Nikita starts with no cubes.
- In each move, he can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

**Key Observations:**
1. **Parity (Odd/Even Nature):**
   - If `n` is odd, the final number of cubes `m` must also be odd because starting from 0, an odd number of moves will result in an odd number of cubes.
   - If `n` is even, the final number of cubes `m` must also be even because starting from 0, an even number of moves will result in an even number of cubes.
   
2. **Range of Possible Values:**
   - The minimum number of cubes after `n` moves is `max(0, n - n)` which is 0 (if all moves are removals).
   - The maximum number of cubes after `n` moves is `n` (if all moves are additions).

**Program Analysis:**
- The program checks several conditions to determine if `m` cubes can be achieved after `n` moves:
  - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
  - If `m > n`, it prints "No" (since you cannot have more cubes than the number of moves).
  - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes" (this condition seems redundant since if `m == n - 1`, it would already be covered by the parity check).
  - It then checks if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd and prints "Yes" if true.
  - Otherwise, it prints "No".

**Issues in the Program:**
- The condition `elif m == n - 1:` is unnecessary and does not add any value since the parity check already covers this scenario.
- The main logic should focus on checking the parity and the range of possible values (`0 <= m <= n`).

**Simplified Correct Logic:**
- Check if `m` is within the range `[0, n]`.
- Check if `m` and `n` have the same parity (both even or both odd).

### Corrected Program Logic:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if 0 <= m <= n and m % 2 == n % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

Given the original program, it incorrectly handles certain cases due to the redundant and incorrect conditions. Therefore, the original program is not fully correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
