Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita starts with no cubes and can perform `n` moves where each move can either add one cube or remove one cube from the tower. We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity (Odd/Even Nature):**
   - Adding or removing one cube changes the parity of the number of cubes.
   - If we start with 0 cubes (even), after an even number of moves, we will still have an even number of cubes.
   - After an odd number of moves, we will have an odd number of cubes.
   
2. **Constraints:**
   - `n` is the total number of moves.
   - `m` is the desired number of cubes.
   - If `m` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes you can have after `n` moves is `n`.

### Correct Logic:
- If `m > n`, print "No" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `m <= n` and `m` and `n` have the same parity (both odd or both even), print "Yes".
- Otherwise, print "No".

### Program Analysis:
Let's check the given program against these observations:

1. **Case `n == m`:**
   - This is a special case where the number of moves equals the number of cubes desired. This is always possible by adding one cube per move. The program correctly prints "Yes".

2. **Case `m > n`:**
   - The program correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.

3. **Case `m == n - 1`:**
   - This case is not necessary to handle separately because it is covered by the general parity check. If `n` is odd and `m` is even (or vice versa), this condition would already be handled by the parity checks. However, the program specifically checks this case and prints "Yes". This is technically correct but redundant.

4. **Parity Checks:**
   - The program checks if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd. If so, it prints "Yes". This is correct based on our analysis.
   - If `m` and `n` have different parities, it prints "No". This is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all the necessary conditions correctly. The redundant check for `m == n - 1` does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
