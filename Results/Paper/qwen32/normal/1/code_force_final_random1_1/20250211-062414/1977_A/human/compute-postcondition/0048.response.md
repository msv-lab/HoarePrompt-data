Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `m` is the second integer from the input. If `m` is greater than `n`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` is equal to `n - 1`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` also remain unchanged.**
