The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `i` is set to 2.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `m` is the second integer from the input.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('No')`.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'` without referencing any of the initialized variables, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

Therefore, the output of the code is:
Output: **No**
