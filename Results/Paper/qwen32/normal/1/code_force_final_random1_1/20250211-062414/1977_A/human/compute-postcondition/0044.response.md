The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m` described in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'No'`, the output will be:

Output: **No**
