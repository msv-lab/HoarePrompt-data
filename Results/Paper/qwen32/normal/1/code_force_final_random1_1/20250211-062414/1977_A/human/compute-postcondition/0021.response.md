Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `n` is not equal to `m`, and `m` is less than or equal to `n`. If `m` equals `n - 1`, then `m` and `n` retain their original values. Otherwise, `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, and if both `m` and `n` are even, they retain their original values. If at least one of `m` or `n` is not even, at least one of them becomes even.**
