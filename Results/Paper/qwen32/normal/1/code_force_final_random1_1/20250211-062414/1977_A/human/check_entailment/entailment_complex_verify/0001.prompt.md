You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop has completed `t` iterations, and for each pair `(n, m)`, "Yes" or "No" has been printed based on the specified conditions. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` reflect the last pair processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. Based on specific conditions related to the values of `n` and `m`, it prints "Yes" or "No".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita starts with no cubes and can perform `n` moves where each move can either add one cube or remove one cube from the tower. We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity (Odd/Even Nature):**
   - Adding or removing one cube changes the parity of the number of cubes.
   - If we start with 0 cubes (even), after an even number of moves, we will still have an even number of cubes.
   - After an odd number of moves, we will have an odd number of cubes.
   
2. **Constraints:**
   - `n` is the total number of moves.
   - `m` is the desired number of cubes.
   - If `m` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes you can have after `n` moves is `n`.

### Correct Logic:
- If `m > n`, print "No" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `m <= n` and `m` and `n` have the same parity (both odd or both even), print "Yes".
- Otherwise, print "No".

### Program Analysis:
Let's check the given program against these observations:

1. **Case `n == m`:**
   - This is a special case where the number of moves equals the number of cubes desired. This is always possible by adding one cube per move. The program correctly prints "Yes".

2. **Case `m > n`:**
   - The program correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.

3. **Case `m == n - 1`:**
   - This case is not necessary to handle separately because it is covered by the general parity check. If `n` is odd and `m` is even (or vice versa), this condition would already be handled by the parity checks. However, the program specifically checks this case and prints "Yes". This is technically correct but redundant.

4. **Parity Checks:**
   - The program checks if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd. If so, it prints "Yes". This is correct based on our analysis.
   - If `m` and `n` have different parities, it prints "No". This is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all the necessary conditions correctly. The redundant check for `m == n - 1` does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
