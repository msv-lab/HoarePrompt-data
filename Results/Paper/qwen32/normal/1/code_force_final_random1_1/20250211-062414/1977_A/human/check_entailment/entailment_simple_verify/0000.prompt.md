You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop has completed `t` iterations, and for each pair `(n, m)`, "Yes" or "No" has been printed based on the specified conditions. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` reflect the last pair processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move consists of adding or removing exactly one cube.
- The initial number of cubes in the tower is zero.

### Key Points:
- The difference between `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes) must be such that we can reach `m` cubes using exactly `n` moves.
- Since each move changes the number of cubes by exactly one, the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` must match for it to be possible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program checks several conditions:
1. If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
2. If `m > n`, it prints "No".
3. If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
6. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `if m == n - 1: print('Yes')` is unnecessary and incorrect. It does not align with the logic that the parity of `n` and `m` must match.
- The conditions `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` are sufficient to cover all valid cases where `m` cubes can be achieved with `n` moves.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case where `n = 4` and `m = 2`. According to the problem description, this should be possible because we can add one cube, remove one cube, add one cube, and remove one cube again, ending up with 2 cubes. However, the program would print "No" because it doesn't account for the parity condition correctly.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrect condition `if m == n - 1: print('Yes')`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly handles certain cases and includes unnecessary conditions that do not align with the problem description. Specifically, the condition `if m == n - 1: print('Yes')` is incorrect and leads to wrong results for some inputs. The correct approach should only check the parity of `n` and `m`.
