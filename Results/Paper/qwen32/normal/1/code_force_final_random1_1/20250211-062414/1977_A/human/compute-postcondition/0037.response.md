The only variable in the loop head is `i`, as it is the iterating variable in the `range(t)` function. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged according to the problem statement.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Since the loop iterates over `range(t)`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` should be set to 2 for the next iteration to proceed.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as per the given conditions.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `m` is the second integer from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` also remain unchanged regardless of whether `m` is greater than `n` or `m` equals `n - 1`.**
