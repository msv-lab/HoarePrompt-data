In this task, we need to determine the output of the `print` statement given the initial state of the program. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

However, the `print` statement provided is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Yes**
