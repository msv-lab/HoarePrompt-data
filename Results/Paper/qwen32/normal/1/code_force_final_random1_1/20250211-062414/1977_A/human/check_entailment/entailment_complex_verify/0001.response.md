Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis Recap:
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves**: Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
3. **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity**: Adding or removing one cube changes the parity of the number of cubes.
   - Starting from 0 cubes (even), after an even number of moves, the number of cubes remains even.
   - After an odd number of moves, the number of cubes becomes odd.
2. **Constraints**:
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes after `n` moves is `n`.
   - If `m <= n` and `m` and `n` have the same parity, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes.
   - If `m` and `n` have different parities, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the program logic and compare it with the correct logic derived from the problem analysis.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Annotations:
- **State before function call**: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).
- **Inside the loop**: For each pair `(n, m)`, the program checks several conditions and prints "Yes" or "No".

### Evaluation of Conditions:
1. **Case `n == m`**:
   - This condition is correct. If `n` moves are made and `n` cubes are desired, it's always possible by adding one cube per move.
   
2. **Case `m > n`**:
   - This condition is correct. It's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   
3. **Case `m == n - 1`**:
   - This condition is redundant. If `n` is odd and `m` is even (or vice versa), this condition would already be handled by the parity checks. This specific check does not add value to the solution.
   
4. **Parity Checks**:
   - **Both `m` and `n` are even**: This condition is correct. If both are even, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes.
   - **Both `m` and `n` are odd**: This condition is correct. If both are odd, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes.
   - **Different parities**: This condition is correct. If `m` and `n` have different parities, it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all necessary conditions correctly. The redundant check for `m == n - 1` does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
