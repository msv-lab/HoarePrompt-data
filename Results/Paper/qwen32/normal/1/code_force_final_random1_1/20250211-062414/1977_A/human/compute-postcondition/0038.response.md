The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, and `n` and `m` are initially set to the first and second integers from the input respectively. However, the initial state of `n` and `m` is overwritten by the new input values.

Since the code only updates the values of `n` and `m` and does not affect `t` or `i`, the output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `m` is the second integer from the input.**
