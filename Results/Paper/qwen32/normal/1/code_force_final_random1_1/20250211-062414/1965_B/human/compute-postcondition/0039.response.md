Functionality: **The function generates and returns a space-separated string of integers based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` equals 1 and `n` equals 2, it returns '1\n2'. If `k` equals 1 and `n` is greater than 2, it returns a sequence starting with `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. For other values of `k`, it returns a sequence starting with `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, k - 1 - sum_of_previous_elements, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.**
