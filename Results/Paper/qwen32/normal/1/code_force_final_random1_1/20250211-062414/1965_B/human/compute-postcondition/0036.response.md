Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of `b`. If `k == 1`, then the program processes a specific list `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16]`. Otherwise, the program processes a different list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, k - 524288, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^(lk), 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1)]`.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the program based on whether `k` equals 1 or not, while retaining the initial conditions of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l`.
