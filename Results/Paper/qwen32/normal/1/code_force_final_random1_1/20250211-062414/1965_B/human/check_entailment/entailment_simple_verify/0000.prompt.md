You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `v`.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_11`) and two main functions (`func_12` and `func_13`), but only `func_14` and `func_15` are relevant for solving the problem. Here’s how they work:

- **`func_14()`**: This function generates the sequence `a` for a given pair `(n, k)`. It handles two cases:
  - When `k == 1`: It constructs a sequence that avoids sums equal to 1 but allows all other sums up to `n`.
  - When `k > 1`: It constructs a sequence that avoids sums equal to `k` but allows all other sums up to `n`.

- **`func_15()`**: This function reads the number of test cases and applies `func_14()` to each test case, printing the results.

### Detailed Examination of `func_14()`

#### Case 1: `k == 1`
- The sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and continues with powers of 2 (`2^i` for `i >= 2`).
- This ensures that no subsequence can sum to 1 because the smallest element is 2.
- All sums from 2 to `n` can be formed using combinations of these elements.

#### Case 2: `k > 1`
- The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k-1`.
- It then adds `k-1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the initial part is less than `k`.
- It includes `k+1` and `2*k+1` to avoid forming `k` while still allowing sums close to `k`.
- It continues with powers of 2 beyond the length of the binary representation of `k`.

### Verification Against Edge Cases
Let's verify if the program handles various edge cases correctly:

1. **Small Values of `n` and `k`**:
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the sequence `[1]` is correct because it allows sums of 1 but not 2.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` is correct because it allows sums from 2 to 6 but not 1.
   - For `n = 8` and `k = 8`, the sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` is correct because it allows sums from 1 to 7 but not 8.
   - For `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the sequence `[7, 1, 4, 1]` is correct because it allows sums from 1 to 9 except 3.
   - For `n = 10` and `k = 7`, the sequence `[1, 2, 8, 3]` is correct because it allows sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

2. **Larger Values of `n` and `k`**:
   - The logic for generating the sequence should handle larger values of `n` and `k` correctly by ensuring that the sum of any subset of the sequence does not equal `k` while allowing all other sums up to `n`.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly handle the problem requirements for all provided examples and edge cases. The logic for constructing the sequence ensures that the conditions are met for both small and large values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly constructs sequences that meet the problem requirements for all test cases and edge scenarios, ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums up to `n`.
