The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, `2 ** i` evaluates to `4`. Therefore, the list `ans` which was initially `[2, 3, 2]` will now be `[2, 3, 2, 4]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` equals 1, `n` is at least 4, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b` (which must be greater than 2), `ans` is `[2, 3, 2, 4]`, `i` is 2**.
