To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `lk`.

Here's the given loop:
```python
for i in range(lk - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the range `(lk - 1)` must be greater than 0. This means `lk` must be at least 2.

Let's break down the dependencies:

- `lk` is the length of `bk`, where `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- For `lk` to be at least 2, `k` must be at least 3 (since the binary representation of 1 is "1" and the binary representation of 2 is "10", which has a length of 2).

Given the constraints:
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n`
- `k` is not equal to 1

We need to ensure `k` is at least 3 to satisfy `lk ≥ 2`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `k` should be at least 3.
- `lk` should be at least 2.
- `i` should be initialized to 0 (as per the default behavior of the `range` function).

So, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `3 ≤ k ≤ n`; `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of `bk` and `lk` must be at least 2; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is 0**
