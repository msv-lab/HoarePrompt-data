The given code snippet modifies the element at index `i` in the list `pd` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. 

Given the initial state, `pd[i]` initially holds the cumulative sum of the digits of its respective index up to `i`. Since `i` is 1, `pd[1]` is being updated by adding `int(j)` to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where the first `t` elements are the cumulative sums of the digits of their respective indices up to `i`, with `pd[1]` increased by `int(j)`, `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the value at `pd[1]` is now the original cumulative sum plus `int(j)`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
