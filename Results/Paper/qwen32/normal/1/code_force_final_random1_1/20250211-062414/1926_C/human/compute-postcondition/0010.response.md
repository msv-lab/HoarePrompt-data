To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the provided loop:

```python
while num != 0:
    a = a + num % 10
    num = int(num / 10)
```

### Explanation of the Loop:
- The loop continues as long as `num` is not zero.
- In each iteration, the last digit of `num` is added to `a`.
- Then, `num` is updated to be the integer part of `num` divided by 10, effectively removing the last digit.

### Iteration Analysis:
- **First Iteration:** The last digit of `num` is added to `a`, and `num` becomes the integer division of `num` by 10.
- **Second Iteration:** The new last digit of the updated `num` is added to `a`, and `num` is again reduced by removing the last digit.
- **Third Iteration:** This process repeats, adding the last digit of the current `num` to `a` and then removing the last digit from `num`.

### Final State:
The loop will continue until `num` becomes 0. At this point, all digits of the original `num` will have been added to `a`. Therefore, the final value of `a` will be the sum of all the digits of the original `num`.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations, `num` will be 0, and `a` will be the sum of all the digits of the original `num`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`num` is 0, `a` is the sum of all digits of the original `num`.**
