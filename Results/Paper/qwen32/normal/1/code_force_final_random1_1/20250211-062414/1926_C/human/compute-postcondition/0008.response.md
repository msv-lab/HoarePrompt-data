The code snippet modifies the value of `a` by adding the last digit of `num` to it. Since the initial state specifies that `num` already has its last digit removed, `num % 10` would actually be the second-to-last digit of the original `num`. However, the problem description seems to imply that `a` was initially the last digit of the original `num`. Therefore, `num % 10` here would be 0 because the last digit has been removed from `num`.

Thus, `a` is updated to `a + 0`, which means `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` < 2 · 10^4 (with the last digit removed), `a` is the last digit of the original `num`.**
