The code snippet modifies the value of `pd[i]` by adding the value of `pd[i - 1]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is `n + 2`, which means `pd[n + 2]` is updated to `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n` except `pd[n + 2]` which is now `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1]`, `i` is `n + 2`.**
