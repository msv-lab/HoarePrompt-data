To determine the necessary adjustments for the given loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in str(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variable `j` iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Therefore, the state of `i` is crucial for the loop to execute.

### Analysis:
- **`t`**: This variable is described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). It does not directly affect the loop's execution.
- **`n`**: This variable is described as an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). It does not directly affect the loop's execution.
- **`N`**: This is a constant set to 200001 and does not affect the loop's execution.
- **`pd`**: This is a list where the first `t` elements are cumulative sums of the digits of their respective indices up to `i`. It does not directly affect the loop's execution.
- **`i`**: This is the variable that needs to be adjusted because the loop iterates over the string representation of `i`.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be an integer that, when converted to a string, has at least one character. The smallest such integer is 0 (since `str(0)` is "0"), but since `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and the problem context suggests `i` is already incremented, we should consider the smallest positive integer, which is 1.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where the first `t` elements are the cumulative sums of the digits of their respective indices up to `i`, `i` is 1**
