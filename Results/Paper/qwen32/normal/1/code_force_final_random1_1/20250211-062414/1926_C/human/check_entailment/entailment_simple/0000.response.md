### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the cumulative sums of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and storing them in an array `A`. For each test case, it simply retrieves the precomputed result from the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - It iterates through numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each number `i`, it computes the sum of its digits using the `func_1` function.
   - It adds this digit sum to the running total `sum`.
   - It appends the current value of `sum` to the list `A`.

2. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - It prints the value at index `n-1` of the list `A`, which represents the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer `num` and calculates the sum of its digits.
   - It repeatedly extracts the last digit of `num` using `num % 10`, adds it to `a`, and then removes the last digit from `num` using integer division by 10 (`num = int(num / 10)`).
   - When `num` becomes 0, the function returns the sum of the digits stored in `a`.

### Analysis:

- **Precomputation**: The precomputation step ensures that the sum of the digit sums for all numbers up to 200,000 is computed once and stored in `A`. This allows for constant-time retrieval of results for any test case.
- **Efficiency**: Given the constraints (up to 10,000 test cases and `n` up to 200,000), precomputing the results is efficient and well within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.
- **Correctness**: The logic for computing the digit sum in `func_1` is correct. The precomputation step correctly accumulates these sums, and retrieving the result for each test case is straightforward and correct.

### Conclusion:

The program is both efficient and correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

**Correctness: True**
