The given code snippet modifies the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Here's the breakdown:

- `i` is `n + 2`.
- `j` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`.

Given these conditions, `j` is the first digit of the number `n + 2`. 

Since `pd[i]` was initially `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + 2 * int(j)`, after executing the line `pd[i] += int(j)`, the new value of `pd[i]` becomes:

\[ \text{new } pd[i] = (pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + 2 * int(j)) + int(j) = pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + 3 * int(j) \]

Thus, the updated state of `pd[i]` is `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + 3 * int(j)`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n` except `pd[n + 2]` which is now `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + 3 * int(j)`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`**.
