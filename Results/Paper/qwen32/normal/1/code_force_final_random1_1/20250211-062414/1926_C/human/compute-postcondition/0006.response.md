The code divides `num` by 10 and converts the result back to an integer, effectively removing the last digit from `num`. Since `a` was already defined as the last digit of the original `num`, its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` < 2 · 10^4 (with the last digit removed), `a` is the last digit of the original `num`.**
