In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to indicate that the loop variable itself is not needed within the loop body.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t` since it is the only variable in the loop head. The other variables (`n`, `N`, and `pd`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect whether the loop executes.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Here is the state after considering the requirements:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to 200000**
