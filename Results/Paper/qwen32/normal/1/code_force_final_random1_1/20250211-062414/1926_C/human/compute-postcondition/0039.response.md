To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t - 1 \leq 10^4\). This implies \(1 \leq t \leq 10001\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `N` is a constant integer set to 200001.
- `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to 200000.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(pd[n])
```

### Explanation:
The list `pd` is precomputed such that `pd[i]` contains the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`. Therefore, `pd[n]` will contain the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Output:
The output will be the value of `pd[n]`, which is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `pd[n]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the precomputed value of `pd[n]`.

Output: **pd[n] (where pd[n] is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n)**
