### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided code and verify whether it correctly computes the minimum cost for purchasing `n` yogurts under the given promotion rules.

1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (the number of yogurts), `a` (the price of one yogurt), and `b` (the price of two yogurts with promotion).

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - If `b * 2 < a`, it means buying two yogurts separately is cheaper than buying them with the promotion. However, this condition is not logically sound because `b` is already the price for two yogurts, so `b * 2` would be twice the promotional price, which doesn't make sense in this context. The correct condition should be `b < a * 2` to check if the promotion price is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually.
   - If `n % 2 == 0`, it means `n` is even, and the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion price, resulting in a total cost of `(n / 2) * b`.
   - If `n % 2 != 0`, it means `n` is odd. The optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible using the promotion price and then buy the remaining single yogurt at the regular price. This results in a total cost of `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

3. **Implementation Issues**:
   - The condition `if B * 2 < C` is incorrect. It should be `if C < B * 2` to check if the promotion price is cheaper.
   - The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are used in the code, but they should be `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively to match the problem statement.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b < a * 2:
            # Promotion price is cheaper than buying two separately
            if n % 2 == 0:
                print((n // 2) * b)
            else:
                print(((n // 2) * b) + a)
        else:
            # Regular price is cheaper or the same
            print(n * a)

# Example usage:
# Input:
# 4
# 2 5 9
# 3 5 9
# 3 5 11
# 4 5 11
# Output:
# 9
# 14
# 15
# 20
```

### Conclusion:

The original code contains logical errors in the conditions and variable naming, making it incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
