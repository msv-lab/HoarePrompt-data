The code reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The variable `i` was previously incremented by 1, but since the code does not modify `i`, its incremented state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.**
