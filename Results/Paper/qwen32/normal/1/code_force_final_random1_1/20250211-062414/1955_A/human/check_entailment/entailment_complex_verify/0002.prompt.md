You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: i is equal to n, and t remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on specific conditions involving these integers. The final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the corresponding results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts with a promotion is `b` burles.
- We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Key Observations:
1. If the price for two yogurts (`b`) is greater than or equal to twice the price of one yogurt (`2 * a`), it's always cheaper to buy yogurts individually.
2. If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs.
3. If `n` is odd, the optimal strategy is to buy `(n // 2)` pairs and one additional yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the logic in the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

- `A` corresponds to `n` (number of yogurts).
- `B` corresponds to `a` (price of one yogurt).
- `C` corresponds to `b` (price of two yogurts).

#### Case 1: `if B * 2 < C`
This condition checks if it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually rather than in pairs. If true, it prints `A * B`, which is the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the individual price.

#### Case 2: `elif A % 2 == 0`
This condition checks if `n` is even. If true, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the cost of buying all yogurts in pairs.

#### Case 3: `else`
If `n` is odd, this block executes. It calculates the number of pairs (`X = A // 2`) and adds the cost of one additional yogurt (`B`). Thus, it prints `X * C + B`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all scenarios:
- Buying yogurts individually when the promotion price is not beneficial.
- Buying all yogurts in pairs when `n` is even.
- Buying `(n // 2)` pairs and one additional yogurt when `n` is odd.

Thus, the program is correct.
