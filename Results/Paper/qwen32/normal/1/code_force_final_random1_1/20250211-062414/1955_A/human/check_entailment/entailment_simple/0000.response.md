Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective:** Determine the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts under promotion.
- **Logic:**
  - If buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying them individually (`2*a`), then use the promotion.
  - Otherwise, calculate the cost based on whether `n` is even or odd:
    - If `n` is even, buy all yogurts in pairs.
    - If `n` is odd, buy `(n-1)` yogurts in pairs and the last one individually.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code logic seems to have some issues:

1. **Variable Naming:**
   - The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are used instead of `n`, `a`, and `b`. This is not a critical issue but might cause confusion.

2. **Condition Checks:**
   - The condition `if B * 2 < C:` checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion. However, this condition is incorrect because it should check if the promotion price (`C`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2*B`).
   - The correct condition should be `if C < 2 * B:`.

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The calculation for the cost when `n` is even is correct: `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - The calculation for the cost when `n` is odd is also correct: `X = A // 2` followed by `print(X * C + B)`.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the code with proper variable names and conditions:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b < 2 * a:  # Promotion price is cheaper than buying two individually
            if n % 2 == 0:
                print(n * b // 2)
            else:
                print((n // 2) * b + a)
        else:
            print(n * a)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original program has a logical error in the condition check. Therefore, it is incorrect as per the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**
