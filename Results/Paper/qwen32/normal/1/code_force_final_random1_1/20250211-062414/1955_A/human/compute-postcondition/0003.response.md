To determine what will be printed by the `print(A * B)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the given conditions:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. This variable does not affect the calculation of `A * B`.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with specific ranges, but they do not affect the calculation of `A * B`.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- The condition `B * 2 < C` must hold true, but this condition only restricts the relationship between `B` and `C` and does not directly influence the output of `A * B`.

Given these details, the output of the `print(A * B)` statement will simply be the product of the integers `A` and `B`.

Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot provide a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers read from the input)**
