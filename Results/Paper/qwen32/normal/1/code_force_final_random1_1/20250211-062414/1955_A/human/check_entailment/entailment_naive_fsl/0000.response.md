Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price for one yogurt), and `b` (price for two yogurts on promotion). It then calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

Here's the program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Condition 1:** `if B * 2 < C`
   - This checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them at the promotional price.
   - If true, it prints `A * B`, which means buying all yogurts individually.

2. **Condition 2:** `elif A % 2 == 0`
   - This checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
   - If true, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which means buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.

3. **Else Condition:**
   - This handles the case when `A` is odd.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (`X = A // 2`) and buys the remaining yogurt individually.
   - It prints `X * C + B`, which means buying `X` pairs and one additional yogurt individually.

### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs and some additional edge cases:

#### Example Inputs:
1. **Input:** `2 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `9` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `9` (Correct).

2. **Input:** `3 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `14` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `14` (Correct).

3. **Input:** `3 5 11`
   - Expected Output: `15` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `15` (Correct).

4. **Input:** `4 5 11`
   - Expected Output: `20` (Buy 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `20` (Correct).

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **Input:** `1 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `5` (Buy 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `5` (Correct).

2. **Input:** `2 5 10`
   - Expected Output: `10` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `10` (Correct).

3. **Input:** `5 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `23` (Buy 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `23` (Correct).

4. **Input:** `6 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `27` (Buy 3 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `27` (Correct).

5. **Input:** `7 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `32` (Buy 3 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `32` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program with various inputs, including the provided examples and additional edge cases, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**.
