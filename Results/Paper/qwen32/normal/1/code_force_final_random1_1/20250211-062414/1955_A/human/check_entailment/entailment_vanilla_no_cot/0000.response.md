Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (the number of yogurts), `a` (the price for one yogurt), and `b` (the price for two yogurts on promotion).

Here's the logic of the program:

1. If the price of two yogurts (`b`) is greater than twice the price of one yogurt (`a * 2`), then it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
2. If the number of yogurts `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price. The total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
3. If the number of yogurts `n` is odd, the optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and then buy the remaining yogurt individually. The total cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

However, there's an issue with the condition `if B * 2 < C:`. This condition checks if it's cheaper to buy two yogurts individually rather than at the promotion price. But the correct condition should be `if a * 2 <= b:`. This is because if the price of two yogurts individually (`a * 2`) is less than or equal to the promotion price (`b`), then it's better to buy them individually.

Let's fix this condition and check if the rest of the logic is correct:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a * 2 <= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                print(int(n * b / 2))
            else:
                X = n // 2
                print(X * b + a)

```

With this correction, the program now correctly determines the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the wrong condition.

Correctness: **False**
