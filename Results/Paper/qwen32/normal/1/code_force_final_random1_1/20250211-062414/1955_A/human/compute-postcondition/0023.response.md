To determine the output of the `print(int(A * C / 2))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code:

### Initial State:
- `i` is incremented by 1. This detail does not affect the calculation of `int(A * C / 2)`, so it can be ignored for this specific print statement.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement calculates the expression `int(A * C / 2)` and prints the result. Here's the breakdown:
- `A` and `C` are integers.
- The expression `A * C` computes the product of `A` and `C`.
- The result of `A * C` is then divided by 2.
- The `int()` function converts the result to an integer, effectively performing integer division if the result of `A * C / 2` is not already an integer.

### Output:
The output will be the integer value of the expression `int(A * C / 2)`. Since the exact values of `A` and `C` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are integers obtained from the input)**
