Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer; `s` is the new input string; `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s` minus 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise it remains unchanged; `flag` is True if there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in the string `s`, otherwise False; `j` is `len(s) - 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
