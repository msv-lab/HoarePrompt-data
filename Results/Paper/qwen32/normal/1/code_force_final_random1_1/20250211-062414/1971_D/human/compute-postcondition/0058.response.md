The value of `count` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the input integer; `s` is the input string; `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in `s` minus 1; `flag` is True indicating there is at least one '0' followed by a '1' in `s`; `j` is `len(s) - 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.
