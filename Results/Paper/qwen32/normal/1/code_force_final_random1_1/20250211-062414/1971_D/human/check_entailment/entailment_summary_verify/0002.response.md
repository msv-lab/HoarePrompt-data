### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description, the code, and the function summary step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of contiguous pieces a binary string must be cut into so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

#### Key Observations:
- If the string is already sorted, no cuts are needed.
- Each transition from '1' to '0' in the string indicates a point where a cut is necessary because these segments cannot be rearranged into a sorted order without cutting.
- The number of such transitions plus one gives the minimum number of pieces required.

#### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Counting Transitions**: For each string `s`, it initializes a counter `count` to zero.
3. **Iterating Through String**: It iterates through the string from the first character to the second last character.
   - If the current character is '1' and the next character is '0' (`int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1])`), it increments the `count`.
4. **Calculating Result**: After the loop, it prints `count + 1`. This is because the number of pieces is always one more than the number of transitions from '1' to '0'.

#### Function Summary:
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` binary strings. For each binary string, it calculates and prints the number of contiguous segments formed by consecutive characters that are non-decreasing plus one.

#### Verification Against the Problem Description:
- **No Cuts Needed for Sorted Strings**: If the string is already sorted (either all '0's or all '1's or a sequence starting with '0's followed by '1's), there will be no '1' to '0' transitions, and thus `count` will remain zero. The result will be `count + 1 = 1`, which is correct.
- **Transitions Indicate Necessary Cuts**: Each '1' to '0' transition indicates a necessary cut. The code correctly counts these transitions and adds one to get the total number of pieces required.

#### Example Validation:
Let's validate the code with the provided examples:
1. **Input**: `11010`
   - Transitions: `1->0` (at index 1) and `1->0` (at index 3)
   - `count = 2`
   - Output: `count + 1 = 3` (Correct)
2. **Input**: `00000000`
   - No transitions
   - `count = 0`
   - Output: `count + 1 = 1` (Correct)
3. **Input**: `1`
   - No transitions
   - `count = 0`
   - Output: `count + 1 = 1` (Correct)
4. **Input**: `10`
   - Transition: `1->0`
   - `count = 1`
   - Output: `count + 1 = 2` (Correct)
5. **Input**: `0001111`
   - No transitions
   - `count = 0`
   - Output: `count + 1 = 1` (Correct)
6. **Input**: `0110`
   - Transition: `1->0`
   - `count = 1`
   - Output: `count + 1 = 2` (Correct)

All the examples match the expected outputs, confirming that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces required to sort the binary string based on the transitions from '1' to '0'.

**Final: True**
