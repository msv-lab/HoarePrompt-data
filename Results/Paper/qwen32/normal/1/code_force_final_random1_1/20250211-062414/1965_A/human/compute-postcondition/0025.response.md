Output State: **`A` is `False` if it was `True`, or `A` is `True` if it was `False`; `not_c` is `True` indicating no gaps greater than 1 exist in `set_`; `i` is the last index checked or where the loop broke.**

Natural Language: The value of `A` has been toggled. If `A` was `True`, it is now `False`. If `A` was `False`, it is now `True`. The values of `not_c` and `i` remain unchanged.
