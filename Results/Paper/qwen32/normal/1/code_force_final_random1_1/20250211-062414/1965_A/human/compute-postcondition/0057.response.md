Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 2 elements, `j` is equal to the length of `lis`. If the difference between the j-th element and the (j-1)-th element of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is set to False. Otherwise, `test` remains True. The parity of `j` (whether it is odd or even) does not change.**
