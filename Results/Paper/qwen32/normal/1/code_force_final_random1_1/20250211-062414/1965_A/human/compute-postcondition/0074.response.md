Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is the integer read from the input; l is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; lis is a sorted list of unique integers from l with an odd number of elements; test is True; j is equal to the length of lis, which is an odd number. The current value of test is True.**
