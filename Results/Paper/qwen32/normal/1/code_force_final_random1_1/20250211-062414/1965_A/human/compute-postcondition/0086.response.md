Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer read from the input; `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `test` is True; `j` is the length of `lis`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `test` is explicitly set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
