The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `j`). Therefore, the output will be the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of these variables.

Let's break down the reasoning:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `n` is an integer read from the input.
- `l` is a map object containing integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements.
- `j` is set to the integer 3.

None of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Alice**
