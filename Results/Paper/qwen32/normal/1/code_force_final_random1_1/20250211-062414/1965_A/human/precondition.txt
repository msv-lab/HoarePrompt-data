arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each element in arr (a_i) satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function is called multiple times (t times), where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the total number of piles across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
