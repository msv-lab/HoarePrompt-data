To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `j`.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the integer read from the input.
- `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements.
- `j` is 2.
- If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is set to False and the loop is broken out of.

Since `j` is currently 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the loop has just finished executing with `j = 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (as per the `range` function).

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` should be 3.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements, `j` is 3**.
