The given code snippet only changes the value of the variable `not_c` to `False`. None of the other variables (`arr`, `A`, `set_`, `i`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of lines for each test case: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile, with `arr` containing at least two different integers; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with at least two elements; `not_c` is False; `i` is 3**.
