Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in `arr` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function returns 'Alice' in Case_1, and in Case_2, it returns 'Alice' if condition A is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.**
