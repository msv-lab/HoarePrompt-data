Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer read from the input; `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `test` is True if no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1; `j` is the length of `lis`; `i` is incremented by 1. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, then `test` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `test` is True and `j` is len(`lis`) - 1. Additionally, if `test` is True, the length of `lis` is either odd or even.**
