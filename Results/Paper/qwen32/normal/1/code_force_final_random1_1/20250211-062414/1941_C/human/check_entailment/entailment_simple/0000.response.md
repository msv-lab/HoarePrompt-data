### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of deletions needed to make a string beautiful by removing occurrences of the substrings "pie" and "map". The provided code counts the occurrences of these substrings and sums them up for each test case. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Counting Substrings**: The code simply counts how many times "pie" and "map" appear in the string. This count does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of deletions required. For example, consider the string "piepie". Counting substrings would yield 2, but only one deletion (removing either the first 'i' or the last 'p') is sufficient to make the string beautiful.

2. **Overlapping Substrings**: The code does not handle overlapping substrings properly. For instance, in the string "mapie", the code would count both "map" and "pie" separately, leading to an incorrect result of 2 deletions. However, removing just the 'a' would suffice to make the string beautiful.

3. **Greedy Deletion Strategy**: The problem requires a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to ensure that deletions are minimized. The current approach does not account for these complexities.

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it does not accurately compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

### Correctness: **False**
