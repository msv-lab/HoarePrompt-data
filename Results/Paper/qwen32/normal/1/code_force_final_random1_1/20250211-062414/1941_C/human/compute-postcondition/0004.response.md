The code snippet assigns the value of `s.count('pie')` to the variable `y`. This means `y` will now hold the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the string input from the user; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**
