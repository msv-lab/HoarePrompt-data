Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string `s` to ensure it no longer contains the substrings "pie" or "map". 

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is not used in the program) and a string `s`. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in `s` and prints the sum of these counts.

### Reasoning

1. **Counting Substrings**: The program correctly counts the number of times "map" and "pie" appear in the string `s`.
2. **Summing Counts**: By summing the counts of "map" and "pie", the program is attempting to calculate the total number of occurrences of these substrings.
3. **Minimum Deletions**: However, the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" does not necessarily give the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of these substrings. This is because the substrings might overlap, and removing characters from one substring could affect another.

### Example

Consider the string "mapie". The program would count:
- "map": 1 time
- "pie": 1 time

Summing these gives 2, but only 2 deletions are actually needed ("ma" or "ie" can be removed to eliminate both substrings).

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. It overcounts the deletions needed when substrings overlap.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
