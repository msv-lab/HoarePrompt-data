### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to ensure it no longer contains the substrings "pie" or "map". The provided program counts the occurrences of these substrings and outputs their sum for each test case.

However, the program's logic is flawed because simply counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" does not necessarily give the minimum number of deletions required to remove all instances of these substrings. Overlapping substrings or substrings that can be made non-existent with fewer deletions than the sum of their counts might exist.

For example, consider the string "mpieam". The program would count one "pie" and one "map", resulting in a total of 2 deletions. However, removing just the 'm' at index 0 would suffice to make the string beautiful, requiring only 1 deletion.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not account for overlapping substrings or more efficient ways to remove the substrings.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
