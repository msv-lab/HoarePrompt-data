In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value obtained from `int(input())`, which corresponds to `t` (the number of test cases). The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t` since it is the only one mentioned in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than or equal to 1. The other variables `n` and `s` are defined inside the loop and do not affect whether the loop itself starts executing.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
