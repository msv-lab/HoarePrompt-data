The code snippet initializes the variable `word` as an empty string. No other variables are modified in the given code. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `i` as they were in the initial state, with only `word` being updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is `i + 1`, `word` is an empty string.**
