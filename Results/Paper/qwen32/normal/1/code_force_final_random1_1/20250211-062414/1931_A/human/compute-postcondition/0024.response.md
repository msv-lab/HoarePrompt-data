The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to be the integer representation of the user's input. The initial state specifies that `n` is already the integer value provided by the user input, but since the code reassigns `n`, we consider the new value provided during the execution.

Here’s the updated state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is reassigned to the new integer value provided by the user input.
- `alphabet` remains a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is `i + 1`.**
