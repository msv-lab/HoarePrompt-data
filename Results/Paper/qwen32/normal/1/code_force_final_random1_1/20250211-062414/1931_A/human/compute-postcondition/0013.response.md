To determine the output of the `print(word)` statement, we need to analyze the conditions and the construction of the `word` variable based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is set to the value of `t`.
- `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

### Conditions for Constructing `word`:
1. **If `n` is greater than 52:**
   - `word` is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.

2. **If `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52:**
   - `word` is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[52 - n] + 'z'`.

3. **If 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26:**
   - `word` is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

### Analysis:
Given the range of `n` (which is the same as `t`), let's consider different ranges of `n`:

- **For \(1 \leq n \leq 26\):**
  - `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
  - For example, if `n = 1`, `word` would be `'aa' + alphabet[1 - 3]` which is `'aa' + alphabet[-2]`. Since indexing from -2 in the alphabet string would wrap around to the second last character, this would be `'aa' + 'y'` resulting in `'aay'`.
  - If `n = 3`, `word` would be `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` which is `'aa' + alphabet[0]` resulting in `'aaa'`.
  - If `n = 26`, `word` would be `'aa' + alphabet[26 - 3]` which is `'aa' + alphabet[23]` resulting in `'aaw'`.

- **For \(27 \leq n \leq 52\):**
  - `word` is `'a' + alphabet[52 - n] + 'z'`.
  - For example, if `n = 27`, `word` would be `'a' + alphabet[52 - 27] + 'z'` which is `'a' + alphabet[25] + 'z'` resulting in `'azz'`.
  - If `n = 52`, `word` would be `'a' + alphabet[52 - 52] + 'z'` which is `'a' + alphabet[0] + 'z'` resulting in `'aaz'`.

- **For \(n > 52\):**
  - Since `n` is bounded by 100, the only possible values are from 53 to 100.
  - `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
  - For example, if `n = 53`, `word` would be `alphabet[53 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `alphabet[0] + 'zz'` resulting in `'azzz'`.
  - If `n = 100`, `word` would be `alphabet[100 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `alphabet[47] + 'zz'` resulting in `'zzzz'`.

### Conclusion:
The exact value of `word` depends on the value of `n` (which is the same as `t`). Given the constraints, `word` will be constructed based on the above rules.

Output: **word (where word is constructed based on the value of n as described above)**
