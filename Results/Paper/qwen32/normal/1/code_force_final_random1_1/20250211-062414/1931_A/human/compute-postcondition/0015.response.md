The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is initially equal to `t`, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `word` is determined based on the value of `n`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

After executing the code snippet, `n` will be reassigned to the new integer value provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `alphabet`, `word`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `word` is determined based on the value of `n`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
