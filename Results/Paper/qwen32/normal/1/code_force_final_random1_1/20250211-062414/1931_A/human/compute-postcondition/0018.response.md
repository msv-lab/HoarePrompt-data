The code snippet appends a new string to the existing `word` variable. Given that `word` was initially an empty string, it will now contain the string `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. Since `alphabet` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `alphabet[n - 28]` will be the letter corresponding to the position `n - 28` in the alphabet. 

Let's break down the changes:
- `word` was an empty string and is now `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Given the constraints, `n` must be such that `n - 28` results in a valid index for `alphabet` (i.e., between 0 and 25 inclusive). This means `n` must be between 28 and 53 inclusive.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
