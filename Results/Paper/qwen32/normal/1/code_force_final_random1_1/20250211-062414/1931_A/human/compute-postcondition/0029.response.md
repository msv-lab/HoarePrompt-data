Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is `i + 1`. If `n` > 26, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. Otherwise, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'`.**
