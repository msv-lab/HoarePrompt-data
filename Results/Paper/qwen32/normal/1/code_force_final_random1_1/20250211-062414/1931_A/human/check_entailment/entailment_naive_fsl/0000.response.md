Let's analyze the given program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to decode an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) into a lexicographically smallest 3-letter word.
- Each letter corresponds to a number from 1 to 26 (a=1, z=26).
- The sum of these numbers should equal `n`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to decode the integer `n` into a 3-letter word using the following logic:
1. If `n > 52`, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
2. If `n > 26`, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
3. Otherwise, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Let's check if this logic covers all possible values of `n` and produces the lexicographically smallest word.

### Edge Cases and Testing:
1. **Minimum Value (`n = 3`)**:
   - Expected: `'aaa'` (1 + 1 + 1)
   - Actual: `'aa' + alphabet[0]` → `'aaa'`
   - This works correctly.

2. **Middle Values (`27 ≤ n ≤ 52`)**:
   - For `n = 27`, expected: `'aab'` (1 + 1 + 25)
   - Actual: `'a' + alphabet[-1] + 'z'` → `'azz'` (incorrect)
   - For `n = 28`, expected: `'aac'` (1 + 1 + 26)
   - Actual: `'a' + alphabet[0] + 'z'` → `'aaz'` (incorrect)
   - For `n = 29`, expected: `'aad'` (1 + 1 + 27)
   - Actual: `'a' + alphabet[1] + 'z'` → `'abz'` (correct)
   - This logic seems flawed for `n = 27` and `n = 28`.

3. **Maximum Value (`n = 78`)**:
   - Expected: `'zzz'` (26 + 26 + 26)
   - Actual: `alphabet[25] + 'zz'` → `'zzz'`
   - This works correctly.

4. **General Case (`53 ≤ n ≤ 78`)**:
   - For `n = 53`, expected: `'aaz'` (1 + 1 + 26)
   - Actual: `alphabet[0] + 'zz'` → `'azz'` (incorrect)
   - For `n = 54`, expected: `'aba'` (1 + 2 + 25)
   - Actual: `alphabet[1] + 'zz'` → `'bzz'` (incorrect)
   - This logic seems flawed for `n = 53` and `n = 54`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle the cases where `n` is between 27 and 52 correctly. Specifically, it fails to produce the lexicographically smallest word for several values within this range.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the cases where `n` is between 27 and 52, producing incorrect results for these values.
