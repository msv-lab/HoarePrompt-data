Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that corresponds to a given encoded integer `n`. The encoding is done by summing the positions of the letters in the alphabet (where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26).

### Key Points:
- The word consists of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters.
- The encoded value `n` ranges from 3 to 78.
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest word that sums up to `n`.

### Approach:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should try to use the smallest possible letters first. Here's how the approach should work:
- Start with the smallest letter 'a' (position 1) and see if we can complete the sum with two other letters.
- If not, increment the first letter and try again.
- Continue this process until we find the correct combination.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses a different approach to construct the word:
- If `n > 52`, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- If `n > 26`, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- Otherwise, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

#### Let's Test the Provided Solution with Example Cases:
1. **For `n = 24`:**
   - According to the provided solution, since `n > 26` is false and `n > 52` is false, it will choose `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3]` which is `'aa' + 'r'` resulting in `'aar'`.
   - However, the correct answer should be `'aav'` because `'aav'` is lexicographically smaller than `'aar'`.

2. **For `n = 70`:**
   - According to the provided solution, since `n > 52` is true, it will choose `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `'r' + 'zz'` resulting in `'rzz'`.
   - This is correct.

3. **For `n = 3`:**
   - According to the provided solution, since `n > 26` is false and `n > 52` is false, it will choose `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` which is `'aa' + 'a'` resulting in `'aaa'`.
   - This is correct.

4. **For `n = 55`:**
   - According to the provided solution, since `n > 26` is true and `n > 52` is false, it will choose `'a' + alphabet[55 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'p' + 'z'` resulting in `'apz'`.
   - However, the correct answer should be `'czz'` because `'czz'` is lexicographically smaller than `'apz'`.

5. **For `n = 48`:**
   - According to the provided solution, since `n > 26` is true and `n > 52` is false, it will choose `'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'u' + 'z'` resulting in `'auz'`.
   - This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. It fails for some test cases like `n = 24` and `n = 55`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
