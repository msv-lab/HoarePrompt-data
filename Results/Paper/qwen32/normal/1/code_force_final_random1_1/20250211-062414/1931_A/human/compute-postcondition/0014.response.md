The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`. Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to consider any changes within the loop body.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 from its current value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,
- `n` is equal to `t`,
- `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z',
- `word` is determined based on the value of `n`.

Since `i` is the only variable we can adjust and it is incremented in each iteration, we simply increase `i` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is equal to `t`, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `word` is determined based on the value of `n`, `i` is incremented by 1**
