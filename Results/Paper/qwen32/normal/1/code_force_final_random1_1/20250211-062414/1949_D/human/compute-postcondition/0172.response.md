To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `nx` is a string of length `n`.
- This string is constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` where each '?' character is replaced by either 'F' or 'S'.
- The replacement depends on some conditions involving `sa`.

### Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(nx)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `nx` is a string that has been constructed based on the rules provided in the initial state.
- Since the exact construction rules and the specific values of `xx[n]` and `sa` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact sequence of characters in `nx`.
- However, we know that every '?' in `xx[n]` has been replaced by either 'F' or 'S' according to the conditions involving `sa`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can only describe the nature of `nx` but not its exact content. The print statement will output the constructed string `nx`.

### Final Output:
Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n constructed by replacing '?' in xx[n] with 'F' or 'S' based on conditions involving sa)**
