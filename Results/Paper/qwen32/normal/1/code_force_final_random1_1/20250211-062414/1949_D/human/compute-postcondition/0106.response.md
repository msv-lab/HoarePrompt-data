The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\). `i` is `i + 2`. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` has had `i + 2` appended to it. `sb` has had `i` appended to it.**
