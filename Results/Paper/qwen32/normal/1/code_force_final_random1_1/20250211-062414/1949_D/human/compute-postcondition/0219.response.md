Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, or where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `nx` is 'S'. Additionally, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. Either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.** 

In simple terms, the only change is that `nx` now contains the character 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged.
