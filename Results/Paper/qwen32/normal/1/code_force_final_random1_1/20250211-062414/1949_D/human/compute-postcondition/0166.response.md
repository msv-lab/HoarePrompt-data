The value of `nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is `n` and `j` is `j + 1`, the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` translates to `xx[n][j]`. Therefore, `nx` becomes `nx + xx[n][j]`.

The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is `nx + xx[n][j]`**.
