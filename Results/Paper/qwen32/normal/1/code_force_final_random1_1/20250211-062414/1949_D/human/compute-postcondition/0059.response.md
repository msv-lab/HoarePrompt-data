Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[4]` is incremented by the length of `x` and `a[j]` is incremented by 1 for each 'F' at position `j - 1` in `x`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[4]` is incremented by the length of `x` and `b[j]` is incremented by 1 for each 'S' at position `j - 1` in `x`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the previous input string `x`, followed by the new input string `x`, `x` is the new input string, and `i` is 4.**

In simple terms, the list `xx` now contains an additional element which is the new input string `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
