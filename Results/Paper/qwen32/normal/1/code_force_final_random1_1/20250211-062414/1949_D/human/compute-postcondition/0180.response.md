The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. This means the value of `nx` changes, but the other conditions about `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the relationship between `i`, `j`, and `sa` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`; `nx` has 'F' appended to it.**
