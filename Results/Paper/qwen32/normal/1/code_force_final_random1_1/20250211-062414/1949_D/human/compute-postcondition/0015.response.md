Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `xx` is a list containing a single empty string. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', then `a[i]` is set to 1, `a[j]` is set to 2, and all other elements in `a` are 0, while all elements in `b` remain 0. Otherwise, all elements in `a` remain 0, and `b[j]` is set to 1 or 2 if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', with all other elements in `b` remaining 0.**
