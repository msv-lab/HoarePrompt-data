The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `nx` will be 'F'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`. Additionally, `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4]`.**
