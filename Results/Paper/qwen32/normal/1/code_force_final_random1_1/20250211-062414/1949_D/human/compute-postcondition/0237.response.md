To determine the output of the `print(nx)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided:

- `nx` is a string of length `n` constructed based on the characters of `xx[i]` and the rules for replacing '?' with 'S' or 'F'.

Since the specific content of `xx` and the exact rules for replacing '?' with 'S' or 'F' are not provided, we cannot determine the exact characters in `nx`. However, we know that `nx` is a string of length `n` where any '?' in the original string `xx` has been replaced according to some rule.

Therefore, the output will be a string `nx` whose exact characters depend on the original string `xx` and the replacement rules.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n constructed based on the characters of xx[i] with '?' replaced by 'S' or 'F')**
