The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in the 2D list `xx` to the string `nx`. This means the value of `nx` changes, while the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and the condition related to `sb[:n // 4]` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only change is in `nx`. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is directly appended to `nx`, the new value of `nx` will be the old value of `nx` concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **`nx` is a string concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is found in the substring `sb[:n // 4]`, 'S' is appended to `nx`; otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.**
