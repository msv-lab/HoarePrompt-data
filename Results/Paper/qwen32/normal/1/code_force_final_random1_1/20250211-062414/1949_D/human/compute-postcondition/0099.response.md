The code appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. Since `i` is defined as `i + 1`, it means the current value of `i` is one more than its previous value. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is `i + 1`, `sa` has the new element `i` appended to it.**
