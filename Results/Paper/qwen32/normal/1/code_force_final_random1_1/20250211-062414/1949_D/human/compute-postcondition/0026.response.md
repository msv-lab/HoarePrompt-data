The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the element at index `i` of the list `b` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we assume `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `b` (i.e., `0 ≤ i ≤ n`). The values of `n`, `a`, `xx`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Given that `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, the element at index `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state reflects this change specifically for `b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[i]` incremented by 1, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `j` is `j + 2`.**
