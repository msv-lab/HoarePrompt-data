To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

The given for loop is:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if the range `(1, n + 1)` contains at least one integer. This means `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(1, 2)` is the smallest valid range that contains one integer).

The current state before the loop starts is:
- `nx` is an empty string
- `i` is `n + 1`

Since `nx` and `i` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, `n` does need to be adjusted to ensure the loop runs.

Let's adjust `n` to be at least 1. The value of `j` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1**
