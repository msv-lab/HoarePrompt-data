Given the initial state where `nx` is described as "a string of length n with '?' replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions," we need to determine the exact content of `nx` to predict what will be printed.

However, the specific conditions under which '?' is replaced by 'F' or 'S' are not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the transformation applied to the original string.

Let's break it down:

- `nx` is initially a string of length `n` that contains some number of '?' characters.
- Each '?' in `nx` is replaced by either 'F' or 'S' based on unspecified conditions.

Since the exact conditions for replacement are not given, we cannot determine the precise sequence of 'F' and 'S'. However, we know that every '?' in the original string `nx` will be replaced by either 'F' or 'S'.

Therefore, the output will be a string of length `n` where all '?' characters have been replaced by 'F' or 'S', but the exact sequence depends on the conditions not specified here.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n with all '?' replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the given conditions)**
