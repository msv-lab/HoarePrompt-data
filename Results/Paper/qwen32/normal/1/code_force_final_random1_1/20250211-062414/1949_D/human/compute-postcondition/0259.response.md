The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, `xx`, and `sb`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `nx` is a string.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `j` is 1.
- The condition about `xx[i][j - 1]` and `sb[:n // 4]` does not affect the current operation since the code explicitly appends 'F' to `nx`.

After executing the code, `nx` will have 'F' appended to it.

Output State: **`nx` is a string with 'F' appended, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1.**
