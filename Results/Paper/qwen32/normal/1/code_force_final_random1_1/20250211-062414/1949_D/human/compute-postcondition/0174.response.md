The given code snippet initializes an empty string `nx`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, `sa`, or `i`. The only change is that `nx` is now an empty string.

Output State: **a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` with '?' replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `nx` is an empty string**.
