The code `a[i] += 1` increments the element at index `i` of list `a` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `a[i]`. The values of `n`, `b`, `xx`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `i` incremented by 1, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `j` is `j + 1`.**
