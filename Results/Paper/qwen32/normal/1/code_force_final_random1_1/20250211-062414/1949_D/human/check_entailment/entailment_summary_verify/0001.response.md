### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Matrix Representation**: The input is an `n x n` matrix where each element can be `F`, `S`, `?`, or `.`.
2. **Symmetry**: The matrix is symmetric, meaning `matrix[i][j]` is the same as `matrix[j][i]`.
3. **Constraints**: No more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive videos of the same type (`F` or `S`) should appear in any permutation of scenarios.
4. **Partial Plan**: At most `\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor` transitions are already decided.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the `n x n` matrix.
   - It initializes lists `a` and `b` to count the number of `F` and `S` transitions for each scenario.
   
2. **Counting Transitions**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of `F` and `S` transitions for each scenario.
   
3. **Classifying Scenarios**:
   - It creates lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios with only `F` or only `S` transitions, respectively.
   
4. **Determining the Majority Type**:
   - The program compares the lengths of `sa` and `sb` to decide whether to prioritize `F` or `S`.
   
5. **Assigning Remaining Transitions**:
   - The program adds scenarios with no assigned transitions to either `sa` or `sb` based on the majority type.
   - It assigns remaining `?` transitions based on whether the scenario index is within the first `n//4` of the prioritized list.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Flawed Logic for Consecutive Transitions**:
   - The program does not check if the assignment of remaining transitions ensures that no more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive videos of the same type appear in any permutation of scenarios.
   - The logic of assigning `F` or `S` based on the scenario index being within the first `n//4` of the prioritized list does not guarantee the required constraint.
   
2. **Lack of Comprehensive Validation**:
   - The program does not validate the entire matrix against all possible permutations of scenarios to ensure the constraint is met.
   - The current approach is heuristic and does not guarantee a correct solution for all inputs.

#### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the program does not guarantee that the output will meet the requirement of no more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive videos of the same type for all permutations of scenarios.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
