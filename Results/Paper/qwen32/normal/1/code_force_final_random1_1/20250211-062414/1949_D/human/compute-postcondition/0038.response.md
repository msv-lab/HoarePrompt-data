Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented by 1 for each 'F' in `x` at corresponding positions, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented by 1 for each 'S' in `x` at corresponding positions, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the previous input string `x`, `x` is the new input string, `i` is 4, and `x[j - 1]` is not 'F'**
