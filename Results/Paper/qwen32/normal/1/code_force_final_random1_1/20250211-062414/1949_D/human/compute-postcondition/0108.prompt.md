Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings; `sa` is an empty list; `sb` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)
    if b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. If `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, then `sb` is a list containing the single element `i`. Otherwise, `sb` remains unchanged as an empty list. `sa` remains unchanged as an empty list in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` has the new element `i` appended to it. If `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, then `sb` has the new element `i` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\). `i` is `i + 2`. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` has had `i + 2` appended to it. If `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, then `sb` has had `i` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
