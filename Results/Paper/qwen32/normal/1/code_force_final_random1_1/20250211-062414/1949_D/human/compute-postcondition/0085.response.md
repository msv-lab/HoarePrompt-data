Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with `a[3]` and `a[5]` incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[3]` and `b[5]` incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the previous input string `x`, and the new input string `x`, `x` is the new input string, `i` is 5, `j` is 3.**
