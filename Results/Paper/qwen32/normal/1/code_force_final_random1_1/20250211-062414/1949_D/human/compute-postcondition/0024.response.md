The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the element at index `i` in the list `a` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `a[i]` is increased by 1, while the values of `n`, `b`, `xx`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with `a[i]` incremented by 1, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `j` is `j + 2`.**
