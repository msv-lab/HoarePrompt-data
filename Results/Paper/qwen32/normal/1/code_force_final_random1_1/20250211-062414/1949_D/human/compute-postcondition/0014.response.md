Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `b[j]` which is 1 or 2 if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `x` is the input string.**
