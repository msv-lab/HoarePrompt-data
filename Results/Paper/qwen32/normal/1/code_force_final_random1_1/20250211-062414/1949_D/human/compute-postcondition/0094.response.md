Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` is a list containing the index `i` and `sb` is an empty list. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged as empty lists.**
