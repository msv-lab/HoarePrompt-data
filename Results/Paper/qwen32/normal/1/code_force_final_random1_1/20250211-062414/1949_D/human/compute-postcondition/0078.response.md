Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where the value at index 5 is incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', and by 1 otherwise. The value at index 1 is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F'. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[1]` and `b[5]` incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S'. Additionally, if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b[5]` is further incremented by 1 and `b[2]` is incremented by 1. `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the previous input string `x`, and the new input string `x`. `x` is the new input string. `i` is 5. `j` is 2.**
