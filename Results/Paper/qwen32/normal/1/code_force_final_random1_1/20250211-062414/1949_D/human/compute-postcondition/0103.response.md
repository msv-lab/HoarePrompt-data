To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the current iteration.

2. **Next Iteration Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it took at the end of the previous iteration plus one.

Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Since `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations, we don't need to adjust its value.

**State Adjustment**:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i + 1`. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2` (since `i` was incremented to `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration and will be incremented again at the start of the current iteration).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `i` is `i + 2`**.
