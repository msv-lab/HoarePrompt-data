The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `sa`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `xx`. 

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the newly introduced `sa` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings; `sa` is an empty list.**
