The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was `n + 1`, which means the loop has just finished executing because `j` would be out of the range `[1, n]`. To start the next iteration, `j` needs to be reset to its initial value, which is `1`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is found in the substring `sb[:n // 4]`, 'S' is appended to `nx`; otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.**
