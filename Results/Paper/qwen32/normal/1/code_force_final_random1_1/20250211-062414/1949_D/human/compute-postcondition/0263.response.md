To determine the output of the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the context:

1. **Variable `nx`**: It is described as a string of length `n` constructed based on the values in `xx[i][j - 1]` and the conditions involving `sb[:n // 4]`. This means `nx` is built from some data in a 2D list `xx` and potentially a substring of another string `sb`.

2. **Variable `i`**: It is explicitly stated that `i` is `n + 1`. However, this value of `i` does not directly influence the construction of `nx` as per the given description.

Given these details, we know that `nx` is a string of length `n` but we do not have specific information about the content of `xx[i][j - 1]` or `sb[:n // 4]`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact characters in `nx`.

However, we can describe the output precisely based on the information provided:

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n constructed based on the values in xx[i][j - 1] and the conditions involving sb[:n // 4])**
