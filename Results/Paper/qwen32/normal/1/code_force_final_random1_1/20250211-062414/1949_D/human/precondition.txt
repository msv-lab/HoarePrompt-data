n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where each line contains n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', representing the transition video type between scenarios i and j, with '?' indicating an undecided video type and '.' indicating i=j. It is guaranteed that the i-th character of the j-th line and the j-th character of the i-th line are the same for all i and j, and that at most ⌊n/2⌋ transition videos are already decided (i.e., at most 2⌊n/2⌋ characters are 'F' or 'S').
