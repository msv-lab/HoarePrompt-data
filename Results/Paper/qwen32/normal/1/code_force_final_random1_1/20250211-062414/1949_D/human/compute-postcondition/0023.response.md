To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24,
  - `a` is a list of length `n + 1`,
  - `b` is a list of length `n + 1`,
  - `xx` is a list containing a single empty string,
  - `j` is `j + 1`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive.
- At the end of each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

### Conclusion:
- If `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 2`.
- `n` remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `j` is `j + 2`.**
