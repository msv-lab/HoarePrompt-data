To determine the output of the `print(nx)` statement, we need to understand the initial state provided:

- `nx` is a string of length `n` constructed based on certain rules (though the specific rules aren't detailed here).
- `i` is equal to `n`.

Given this information, we know that `nx` is a string of a specific length `n`, but we don't have the explicit characters or content of `nx`. Therefore, the output will be described in terms of `nx` being a string of length `n`.

Here's the precise description of what will be printed:

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n)**
