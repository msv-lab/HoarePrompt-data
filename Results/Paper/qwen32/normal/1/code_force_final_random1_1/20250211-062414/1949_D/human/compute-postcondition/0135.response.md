The given code snippet appends the character `'F'` to the string `nx`. No other variables are modified in the provided code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- `b` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings.
- `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, or `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
- `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.
- The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
- `nx` is determined based on the conditions involving `xx[i][j - 1]`, `sa`, and `sb`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

After executing the line `nx += 'F'`, the only change is that the string `nx` now includes an additional `'F'` at its end.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, or `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `nx` is the original `nx` with an additional 'F' appended to it, `j` is `j + 1`.**
