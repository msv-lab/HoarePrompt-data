The code reads a line of input, removes any whitespace, and assigns the resulting string to the variable `arr`. This means that `arr` will contain a sequence of '0's and '1's without any spaces.

Given the initial state, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the array of integers `a_i` is transformed into a concatenated string of '0's and '1's in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the new integer read from input, and `arr` is a string consisting of `n` characters where each character is either '0' or '1', with at least one character equal to '1'.**
