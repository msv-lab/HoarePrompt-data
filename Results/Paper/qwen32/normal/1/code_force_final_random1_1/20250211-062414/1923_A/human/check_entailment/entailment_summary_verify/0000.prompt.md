You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of binary integers (0s and 1s). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of 1 in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a ribbon divided into `n` cells, each either containing a chip (`1`) or being free (`0`).
- We need to move chips to the left to form a contiguous block of chips with no free cells between them.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Range for `z`:**
   - `x` is the index of the first `1` from the left.
   - `y` is the index of the first `1` from the right (which corresponds to the last `1` in the original array).
   - `n - y` is used as the end index for slicing, but this is incorrect. It should be `n - y - 1` because string indices are 0-based.
   
2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where all chips are already in a contiguous block.
   - The program does not handle cases where there are multiple blocks of chips separated by free cells.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6
1 0 1 0 1 0
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Explanation:
- The chips are at positions 1, 3, and 5.
- To form a contiguous block, we need to move the chip at position 5 to position 4 and the chip at position 3 to position 2.
- Total operations = 2.

However, the provided program will output `1` for this input because:
- `x` will be `0` (first `1` at position 1).
- `y` will be `1` (last `1` at position 5, which is the second `1` from the right).
- `z` will be `arr[0:5]` which is `"10101"`.
- `z.count('0')` will be `2`, but due to incorrect slicing, the program might output `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations in all cases, especially when there are multiple blocks of chips or when the chips are not initially contiguous.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the range for slicing and does not handle all edge cases, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
