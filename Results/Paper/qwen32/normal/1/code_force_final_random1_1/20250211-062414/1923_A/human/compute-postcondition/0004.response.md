The code `x = arr.find('1')` searches for the first occurrence of the character '1' in the string `arr`. Since the precondition specifies that `arr` contains at least one '1', `x` will be assigned the index of the first '1' found in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the new integer read from input, `arr` is a string consisting of `n` characters where each character is either '0' or '1', with at least one character equal to '1', and `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.**
