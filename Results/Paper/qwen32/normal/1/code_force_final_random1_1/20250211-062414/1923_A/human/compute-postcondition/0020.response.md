The code snippet updates the variable `z` to be the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to, but not including, the index `n - y`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 1, `n` is the newly read integer from input, `arr` is the newly read string of '0's and '1's without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**
