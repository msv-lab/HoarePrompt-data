Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap
- We need to move chips to form a contiguous block with the minimum number of moves.
- A move consists of moving a chip to the nearest free cell to its left.

### Key Observations
- The solution involves identifying the leftmost and rightmost chips.
- The number of moves required is equal to the number of free cells within the span defined by these two chips.

### Analysis of the Given Program
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t = int(input(''))`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n = int(input(''))`: Reads the number of cells.
     - `arr = ''.join(input('').split())`: Reads the configuration of the ribbon, removes spaces, and stores it as a string.
   
2. **Finding Positions of Chips:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: Finds the index of the leftmost chip.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: Finds the index of the rightmost chip by reversing the string and finding the first '1', then converting this to an index from the original string (`n - y`).

3. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: Extracts the substring from the leftmost chip to the rightmost chip.
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: Counts the number of '0's in this substring, which represents the free cells that need to be filled by moving chips.

### Potential Issues
- The logic for determining the span between the leftmost and rightmost chips is correct.
- However, the slicing `arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect because `n - y` does not correctly represent the index of the rightmost chip in the original string. It should be `n - 1 - y`.
- The slicing should be `arr[x:n - y]` corrected to `arr[x:n - y + 1]` or more accurately `arr[x:n - y]` should be `arr[x:len(arr) - y]`.

### Corrected Code Snippet
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:len(arr) - y]  # Corrected slicing
        print(z.count('0'))
```

### Conclusion
The original program has a mistake in the slicing logic, which would lead to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

**Correctness: False**
