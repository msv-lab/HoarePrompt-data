Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer used as a modulus), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It also accepts a string `s` of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The function computes and returns a list `ans` of `n` elements, where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in a list `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`. The list `ans` is returned in reversed order.**
