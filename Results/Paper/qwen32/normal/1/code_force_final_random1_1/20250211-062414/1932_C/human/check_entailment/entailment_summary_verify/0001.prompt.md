You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer used as a modulus), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the instructions in `s`, then calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, taking each product modulo `m`. The function returns these cumulative products in a list, also in reverse order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a` of length `n`, and the string `s` of length `n`.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
   - It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to point to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It iterates over the string `s` and appends either the leftmost or rightmost element of `a` to the list `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This part seems correct as it builds a list `b` that represents the sequence of elements being removed from `a`.

3. **Computing Remainders:**
   - After building the list `b`, the function initializes an empty list `ans` and a variable `p` to 1.
   - It then iterates over the reversed list `b`. For each element `v` in `b`, it multiplies `p` by `v` and takes the result modulo `m`, appending this result to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans`.

### Issues with the Program:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Product Remainders:**
  - The program calculates the product of elements in the reverse order of their removal, which does not match the requirement of calculating the product of the current state of the array `a` before any element is removed.
  - The problem requires the product of all remaining elements in the array `a` at the beginning of each command, not the product of the elements in the order they are removed.

### Correct Approach:

- To solve the problem correctly, you need to maintain the product of the current state of the array `a` and update it as elements are removed.
- You can use prefix and suffix products to efficiently compute the product of the remaining elements after each removal.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
