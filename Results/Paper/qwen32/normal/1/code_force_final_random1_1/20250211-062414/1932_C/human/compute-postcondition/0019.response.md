The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given the initial state, `l` is initially set to 2 if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1. After incrementing, `l` will be 3 if `s[1]` is 'L', and 2 if `s[1]` is 'R'.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing three elements: `a[0], a[1], a[2]` if `s[1]` is 'L', or `a[n-1], a[n-2], a[1]` if `s[1]` is 'R'; `l` is 3 if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`; `i` is 2**
