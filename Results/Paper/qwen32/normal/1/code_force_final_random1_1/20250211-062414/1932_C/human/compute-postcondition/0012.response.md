The code appends the element at index `l` of the list `a` to the list `b`. Given the initial conditions, `l` is 1 if `s[i]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0. Therefore, the element appended to `b` will be `a[1]` if `s[i]` is 'L', or `a[0]` if `s[i]` is 'R'.

Since `b` initially contains one element (either `a[0]` or `a[n-1]`), after appending `a[l]`, `b` will contain two elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `b` is a list containing two elements, initially `a[0]` if `s[i]` is 'R' or `a[n-1]` if `s[i]` is 'L', and now also includes `a[l]` (which is `a[1]` if `s[i]` is 'L' or `a[0]` if `s[i]` is 'R'); `l` is 1 if `s[i]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1` if `s[i]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`; `i` is 1.**
