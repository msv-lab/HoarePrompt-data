The code appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to list `b`. Given the initial conditions, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[i]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`. Since `i` is 1, the value of `r` depends on `s[1]`.

If `s[1]` is 'L', `r` is `n - 1`, and `b` will append `a[n - 1]`.
If `s[1]` is 'R', `r` is `n - 2`, and `b` will append `a[n - 2]`.

Since the exact value of `s[1]` is not specified, we consider both possibilities. However, the structure of the problem implies that `s[1]` will determine which element of `a` is appended to `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `b` is a list containing two elements, initially `a[0]` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `a[n-1]` if `s[0]` is 'R', and now also `a[n-1]` if `s[1]` is 'L' or `a[n-2]` if `s[1]` is 'R'; `l` is 1 if `s[0]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`; `i` is 1.**
