Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `test_cases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(0, n):
        if i == 0:
            if arr[0] < b / a:
                array2.append(arr[0] * a)
        elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `array2` contains elements `[arr[0] * a]` if `arr[0] < b / a` and `[(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a]` for each `i > 0` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f` if the condition is true, otherwise, it is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `array2` contains elements `[arr[0] * a]` if `arr[0] < b / a` and/or `[(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a]` for each `i > 0` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. If the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the sum is less than `f`. Otherwise, the sum is greater than or equal to `f`. All other variables (`arr`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `test_cases`) retain their initial states.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0, `array2` contains elements based on the conditions `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a` and `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i > 0` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases`, and `b` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, and `i` is equal to `n`. Additionally, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is compared to `f`: if it is less than `f`, the condition in the if part holds; otherwise, the condition in the else part holds.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
