Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases`, and `b` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, and `i` is 3. If `arr[0] < b / a`, then `array2` contains at least one element which is `arr[0] * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.**
