Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **Variable `test_cases`**: Greater than or equal to 1. This indicates there is at least one test case.
3. **List `feat`**: A list of integers obtained from the input. It contains at least three elements:
   - `n`: The first element of `feat` and must be greater than 1.
   - `f`: The second element of `feat`.
   - `a`: The third element of `feat`.
   - `b`: The last element of `feat`.
4. **List `arr`**: A list of integers obtained from a new input line. The length of this list is `n`.
5. **List `array2`**: This list is constructed based on the following condition:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` is added to `array2`.
6. **Condition**: The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

### Code Snippet:

```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement itself that depend on the values of `t`, `feat`, `arr`, `array2`, `n`, `f`, `a`, or `b`. The `print` statement is unconditional and will always execute as written.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any specific values of the variables or lists described in the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
