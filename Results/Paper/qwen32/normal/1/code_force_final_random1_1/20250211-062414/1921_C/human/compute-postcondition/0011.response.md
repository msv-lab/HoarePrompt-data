The given code appends a calculated value to the `array2` list. Specifically, it calculates `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` and adds this value to `array2`. 

Given the initial state, the value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`. However, the exact values of `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not specified, so we can only express the new state in terms of these variables.

The only variable that changes is `array2`, which now includes the newly appended value. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list containing the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. The current value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**
