The code appends a calculated value to `array2`. The value appended is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is 4, the value being appended is `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 4, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases`, and `b` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, and `i` is 4; `array2` now includes the new element `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`.**
