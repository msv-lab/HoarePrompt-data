The code snippet provided assigns the value of `feat[1]` to the variable `f`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `i` is 0

After executing the code snippet `f = feat[1]`, the value of `f` remains the same as `feat[1]` because it is already assigned that value in the initial state. Therefore, there is no change in the values of any variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is 0.**
