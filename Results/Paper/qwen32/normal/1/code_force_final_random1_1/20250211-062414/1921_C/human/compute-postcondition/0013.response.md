To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `array2` is a list. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`. At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `1 <= k < n`). At the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `k + 1`.

Since `n` does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `array2` is a list. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value**.

If we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `k + 1`. However, since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we express the state as `i` being incremented by 1 from its current value.
