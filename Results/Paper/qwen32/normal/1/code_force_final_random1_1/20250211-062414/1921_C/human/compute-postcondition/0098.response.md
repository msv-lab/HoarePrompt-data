The code snippet appends the product of `arr[0]` and `a` to the list `array2`. This affects only the `array2` list by adding a new element to it, while all other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 4, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases`, and `b` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, and `i` is 4; `array2` has a new element which is `arr[0] * a` appended to it.**
