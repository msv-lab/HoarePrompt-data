The code appends a calculated value to the `array2` list. Specifically, it calculates `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` and adds this result to `array2`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation, but since the increment happens outside the provided code snippet, we assume `i` has already been incremented to the correct position.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `array2`, which now includes the newly appended value. All other variables retain their original states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list that now includes the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value.**
