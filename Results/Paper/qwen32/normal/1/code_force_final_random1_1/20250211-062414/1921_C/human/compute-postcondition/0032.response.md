The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `array2`. This action does not affect the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `array2` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is an empty list, `i` is `x + 1`**.
