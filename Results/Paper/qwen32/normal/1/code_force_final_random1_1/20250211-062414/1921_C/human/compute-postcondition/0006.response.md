The code assigns the last element of the list `feat` to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`.**
