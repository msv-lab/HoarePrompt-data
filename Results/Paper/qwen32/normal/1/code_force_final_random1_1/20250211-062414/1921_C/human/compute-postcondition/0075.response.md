Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`) and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the differences between consecutive integers in the list and compares this value to a threshold `f`. It prints 'Yes' if the calculated value is less than `f`; otherwise, it prints 'No'.**
