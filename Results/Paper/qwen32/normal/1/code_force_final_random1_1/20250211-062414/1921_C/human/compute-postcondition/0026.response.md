The given code snippet updates the `feat` list by reading a new line of input, splitting it by spaces, and converting each element to an integer. This means that the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` (and potentially other elements in `feat`) will be updated based on the new input.

Here's the Output State:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list that may include the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `i` is `x + 1`**

Explanation in natural language:
- The variable `feat` is now a new list of integers read from the input.
- The values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are updated to reflect the new values in the `feat` list.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `arr`, `array2`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged unless further modified by subsequent code.
