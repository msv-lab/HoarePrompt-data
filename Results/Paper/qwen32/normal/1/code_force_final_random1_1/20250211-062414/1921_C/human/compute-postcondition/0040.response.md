To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can see that the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`. The variable `n` is determined by `feat[0]` and is not modified within the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `i` is `x + 2`
- If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains one element `((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `x + 2`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, as per the `range(1, n)` loop.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 3`.

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `array2`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is `x + 3`**
