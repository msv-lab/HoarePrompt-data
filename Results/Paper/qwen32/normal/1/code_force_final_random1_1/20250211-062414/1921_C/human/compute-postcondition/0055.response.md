The code snippet reads a new line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `arr`. This means that `arr` will now hold the new list of integers obtained from the input, replacing its previous value.

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is 0.**
