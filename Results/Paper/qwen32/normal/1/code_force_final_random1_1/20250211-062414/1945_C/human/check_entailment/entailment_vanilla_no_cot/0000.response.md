Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `pk`:**
   - The variable `pk` is calculated as `n / 2` for both even and odd values of `n`. This is incorrect because for odd `n`, `pk` should be the ceiling of `n / 2`, which is `(n + 1) // 2`.

2. **Percentage Calculation:**
   - The code calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using integer division and multiplication by 100, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. Instead, it should directly compare counts with the required thresholds.

3. **Threshold Comparison:**
   - The code checks if `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, but these percentages are calculated incorrectly. Instead, it should check if `zero >= ceil((i + 1) / 2)` and `one >= ceil((n - i - 1) / 2)`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle the edge cases where the road could be placed before the first house (`i = 0`) or after the last house (`i = n`). These cases need to be explicitly checked.

5. **Finding the Minimum Difference:**
   - The code attempts to find the minimum difference between `pk` and `i` but does not handle the case where no valid `i` is found. It should check if the list `lst` is empty and handle it accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        o = s.count('1')
        z = s.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = float('inf')
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= (i + 1) // 2 + (i + 1) % 2 and one >= (o - one) // 2 + (o - one) % 2:
                lst.append(i)
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(n // 2 - ele))
        final = []
        for elem in lst:
            if abs(n // 2 - elem) == mini:
                final.append(elem)
        if not final:
            if z >= (n + 1) // 2:
                final.append(0)
            elif o >= (n + 1) // 2:
                final.append(n)
        print(final[0])

func()
```

This corrected code addresses the issues mentioned above and should correctly solve the problem as described.
