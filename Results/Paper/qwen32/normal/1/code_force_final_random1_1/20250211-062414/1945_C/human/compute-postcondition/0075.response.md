The code assigns the value of `n / 2` to the variable `pk`. This operation does not affect the values of `final`, `n`, `t`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the conditions and values of these variables as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]; `n` is an input integer; `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n / 2`.**
