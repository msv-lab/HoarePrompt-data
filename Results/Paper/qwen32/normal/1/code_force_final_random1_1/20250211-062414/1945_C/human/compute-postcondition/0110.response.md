Postcondition: **`final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]. `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1; `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` and `one` are counters updated based on the characters in `s`; `lst` is a list conditionally updated based on `zero_perc` and `one_perc` and includes `i + 1` if `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`. If `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`, `lst` also includes `i + 1`. `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
