Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `final` is a sorted list; if `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is updated to contain either the element `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` if `c1` is less than 50; `n` is an input integer; `t` is decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is []; `mini` is 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains empty; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is the percentage of zeros up to index `i` in `s`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero` is 1; `one` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was not '0', otherwise `one` is 0; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is 40 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 20; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`; `i` is 4. If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is `[5]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether the character at index `i` in `s` was '0'; `one` is either 2 or `one + 1` depending on whether the character at index `i` in `s` was '0'; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is either 33 or 50; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 6)` if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `(o - (one + 1)) * 100 // (n - 6)`; `i` is 5; `lst` is `[5, 6]` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains `[5]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
