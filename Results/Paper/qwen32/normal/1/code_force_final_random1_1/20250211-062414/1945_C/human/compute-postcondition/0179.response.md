Postcondition: **`final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether the character at index `i` in `s` was '0'; `one` is either 2 or `one + 1` depending on whether the character at index `i` in `s` was '0'; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is either 33 or 50; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 6)` if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `(o - (one + 1)) * 100 // (n - 6)`; `i` is 5; `lst` is `[5, 6]` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains `[5]`.**
