The code snippet `sl = list(s)` converts the string `s` into a list of its characters. This affects the variable `sl`, which is newly introduced and set to this list. No other variables are directly modified by this line.

Given the initial state:
- `final` is a list that depends on its original length.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0.
- `s` is the user's input.
- `pk` is `n / 2`.

After executing the code, the new variable `sl` holds the list of characters from the string `s`.

Output State: **`final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]; `n` is an input integer; `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`.**
