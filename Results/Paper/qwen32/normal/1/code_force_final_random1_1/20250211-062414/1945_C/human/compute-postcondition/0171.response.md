Postcondition: **`final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero` is 1; `one` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was not '0', otherwise `one` is 0; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is 40 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 20; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`; `i` is 4. If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is `[5]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains empty.**
