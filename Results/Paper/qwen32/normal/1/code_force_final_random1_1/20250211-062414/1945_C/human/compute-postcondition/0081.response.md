The given code snippet initializes two variables, `zero` and `one`, both set to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]; `n` is an input integer; `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0.**
