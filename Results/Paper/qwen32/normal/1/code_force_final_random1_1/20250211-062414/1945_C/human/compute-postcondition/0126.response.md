Postcondition: **`final` is a list containing `[elem]` if the original length of `final` was 0 and `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, otherwise `final` contains the original elements plus `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. If `abs(pk - elem) != mini`, `final` remains unchanged. `n` remains the same, `t` remains the same if the original length of `final` was not 0, `s` remains the same, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains the list of characters from the string `s`, `o` remains the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least one element, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**
