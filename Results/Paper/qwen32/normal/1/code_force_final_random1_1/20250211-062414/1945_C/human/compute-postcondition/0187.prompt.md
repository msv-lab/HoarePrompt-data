Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing at least one element; `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and `abs(pk - ele)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing at least one element; `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the minimum of the previous `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`; `ele` is the next element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing at least two elements; `mini` is the minimum of `100000000`, the previous `mini`, and `abs(pk - ele)`; `ele` is the next element in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
