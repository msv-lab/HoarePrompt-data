Postcondition: **`final` is a sorted list; if `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is updated to contain either the element `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` if `c1` is less than 50; `n` is an input integer; `t` is decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `mini` remain unchanged.**
