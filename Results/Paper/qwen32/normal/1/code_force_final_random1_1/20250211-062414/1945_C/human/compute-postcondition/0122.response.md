The code appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Given that `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `elem`, `final` will contain one element, which is `elem`.

All other variables remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Output State: **`final` is a list containing `[elem]`; `n` remains the same; `t` remains the same if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` remains the same; `pk` remains `n / 2`; `sl` remains the list of characters from the string `s`; `o` remains the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` remains the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing at least one element; `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `elem` is such that `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
