The given code snippet recalculates the value of `one_perc` using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. Here, `o` is the total count of '1's in the string `s`, `one` is the count of '1's encountered up to index `i`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `i` is the current index being processed.

Since the code snippet only updates `one_perc`, the other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `one_perc` depends on the counts of '1's and the current index `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string input provided by the user, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 2`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '0', then `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s` plus 1. If `s[i]` is '1', then `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s` plus 1. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing `[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**

In simpler terms, the output state is the same as the initial state except that `one_perc` has been recalculated based on the formula provided.
