Postcondition: **`final` is a sorted list. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is updated to contain the single element `[0]`. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` is updated to contain the single element `[n]`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and retains its value. If `len(final) != 0`, `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
