`s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will hold the string input provided by the user. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input provided by the user.**
