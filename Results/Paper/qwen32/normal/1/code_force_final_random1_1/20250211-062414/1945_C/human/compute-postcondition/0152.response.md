The given code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `mini`. The value assigned is `pow(10, 8)`, which is a constant value of 100,000,000. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; if `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is updated to contain either the element `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` if `c1` is less than 50; `n` is an input integer; `t` is decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is []; `mini` is 100000000.**
