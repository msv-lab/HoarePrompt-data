The code snippet increments the value of `one` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `final` is a sorted list (unchanged).
- `n` is greater than 1 (unchanged).
- `t` has been decremented by 1 (unchanged).
- `s` is an input string (unchanged).
- `pk` is `n / 2` (unchanged).
- `sl` is a list of characters from `s` (unchanged).
- `o` is the count of '1' in `s` (unchanged).
- `z` is the count of '0' in `s` (unchanged).
- `zero` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero` is 1 (unchanged).
- `one` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was not '0', otherwise `one` is 0 (changed).
- `mini` is 100000000 (unchanged).
- `zero_perc` is 40 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 20 (unchanged).
- `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)` (unchanged, but will be recalculated based on the new value of `one` in subsequent operations).
- `i` is 5 (unchanged).
- If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is `[5]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains empty (unchanged).

After executing `one += 1`, the value of `one` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero` is 1; `one` is `one + 1`; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is 40 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 20; `one_perc` is `(o - (one + 1)) * 100 // (n - 5)`; `i` is 5. If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is `[5]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains empty.**
