Let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `final` is a sorted list.
   - If `len(final) == 0`, then:
     - `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.
     - Depending on the value of `c1`:
       - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` is updated to `[0]`.
       - If `c1 < 50`, `final` is updated to `[n]`.
   - If `len(final) != 0`, `final` contains elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(final[0])
   ```

Given these conditions, let's determine what `final[0]` will be:

- **Case 1**: If `len(final) == 0` initially:
  - `c1` is computed as `o * 100 // n`.
  - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` becomes `[0]`, so `final[0]` is `0`.
  - If `c1 < 50`, `final` becomes `[n]`, so `final[0]` is `n`.

- **Case 2**: If `len(final) != 0` initially:
  - `final` already contains elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
  - Since `final` is sorted, `final[0]` is the smallest element in this filtered list.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `final[0]` without knowing the values of `o`, `n`, `lst`, `pk`, and `mini`. However, we can describe the possible outcomes based on the conditions:

- If `final` was initially empty and `c1 >= 50`, `final[0]` will be `0`.
- If `final` was initially empty and `c1 < 50`, `final[0]` will be `n`.
- If `final` was not initially empty, `final[0]` will be the smallest element in the filtered list from `lst`.

Thus, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is 0 if len(final) was 0 and c1 >= 50, n if len(final) was 0 and c1 < 50, or the smallest element in the filtered list from lst if len(final) was not 0)**
