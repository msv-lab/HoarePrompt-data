Output State: **`final` is a list containing `[elem]` if the original length of `final` was 0, otherwise `final` contains the original elements plus `elem`; `n` remains the same; `t` remains the same if the original length of `final` was not 0, `s` remains the same; `pk` remains `n / 2`; `sl` remains the list of characters from the string `s`; `o` remains the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` remains the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing at least one element; `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**

Natural Language: The list `final` now includes the element `elem`. If `final` was originally empty, it now contains only `elem`. If `final` already had elements, `elem` is appended to the existing elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
