The code appends the value `0` to the list `final`. Since the initial length of `final` was `0`, after appending `0`, the length of `final` becomes `1`. The value of `final` is now `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini` and currently `final` is `[0]`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and its current value is greater than or equal to 50.**
