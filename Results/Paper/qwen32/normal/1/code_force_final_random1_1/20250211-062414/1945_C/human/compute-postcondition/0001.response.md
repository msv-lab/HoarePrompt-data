In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop body is omitted, but the focus is on ensuring that the loop can execute based on the state of the variables in the loop head.

### Analysis:

- The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
- The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a throwaway variable) and `t`.
- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `t`.

### Given State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

### Required Adjustments:
- Since `t` is already within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.
- The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is a throwaway variable used in the loop.

### Conclusion:
Given that `t` is within the specified range, the loop will execute without any modifications to the state of `t`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**

This state ensures that the loop will execute for the given number of test cases.
