The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `lst`. None of the other variables (`final`, `n`, `t`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`) are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State except for the addition of the new variable `lst`.

Output State: **`final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]; `n` is an input integer; `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list.**
