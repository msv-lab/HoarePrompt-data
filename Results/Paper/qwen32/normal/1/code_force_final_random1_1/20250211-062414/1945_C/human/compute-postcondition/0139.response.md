Postcondition: **`final` is a sorted list. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is updated to contain either the element `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` if `c1` is less than 50. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `mini`) remain unchanged.**
