To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given Code Snippet:
```python
one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
```

### Impact Analysis:
- `one_perc` is being calculated using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
- `o` is the count of '1's in the list `sl`.
- `one` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `i` is presumably an index variable, though its exact value is not provided in the initial state.

### Variables Affected:
- `one_perc`: This variable is newly assigned a value based on the formula provided.

### Output State:
Since the exact values of `o`, `one`, `n`, and `i` are not specified, we can only express `one_perc` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1; `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is either 0 or `100 // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**.
