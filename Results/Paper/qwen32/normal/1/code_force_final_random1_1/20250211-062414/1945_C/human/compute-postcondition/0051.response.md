To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which is `elem` in this case. The loop will execute if `lst` contains at least one element.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **`lst`**: This list contains indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50%. For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element.

2. **`zero_perc` and `one_perc`**: These percentages are calculated based on the counts of '0's and '1's in certain substrings of `s`. To ensure `lst` is non-empty, there must be at least one position in the string `s` (or its substrings) where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%.

3. **`zero` and `one`**: These are counts of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`. For `zero_perc` and `one_perc` to be at least 50%, the counts of '0's and '1's in the relevant substrings should be such that their percentages meet the criteria.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `lst` contains at least one element. This can be achieved by ensuring that there is at least one valid index `i` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%.

### Example Adjustment:
To ensure `lst` is non-empty, let's assume the simplest scenario where the entire string `s` (or a significant portion of it) has equal numbers of '0's and '1's, making both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` 50%.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a string with equal numbers of '0's and '1's, e.g., "0101" or "1010".
- `pk` is set to `n / 2`.
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`.
- `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`.
- `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`.
- `zero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`.
- `one` is the count of '1's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`.
- `lst` is a list containing at least one index `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%.
- `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`.
- `final` is an empty list.

Since `lst` must contain at least one element, we can assume a simple string like "0101" or "1010" to ensure that `lst` is non-empty.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is "0101", `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is ['0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 2, `z` is 2, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, `lst` contains at least one index (e.g., [1]), `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`, `final` is an empty list**.

This ensures that the loop will execute because `lst` contains at least one element.
