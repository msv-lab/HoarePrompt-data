To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `final` is a list.
   - The behavior of `final` depends on its original length:
     - If the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is set to `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is set to `[n]`.
     - If the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains `[1, 3]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet is `print(final[0])`, which means it will print the first element of the list `final`.

Given these conditions, there are two scenarios to consider:

- **Scenario 1**: The original length of `final` was 0.
  - In this case, `final` is set to `[0]` if `c1 >= 50`, otherwise `final` is set to `[n]`.
  - Regardless of whether `final` becomes `[0]` or `[n]`, the first element of `final` will be either `0` or `n`.

- **Scenario 2**: The original length of `final` was not 0.
  - In this case, `final` remains `[1, 3]`.
  - Therefore, the first element of `final` will be `1`.

Since the exact values of `o`, `n`, and the original length of `final` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `final[0]` in Scenario 1. However, we can describe the possible outcomes.

### Conclusion:
- If the original length of `final` was 0, `final[0]` will be either `0` or `n` depending on the value of `c1`.
- If the original length of `final` was not 0, `final[0]` will be `1`.

Thus, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is 1 if the original length of final was not 0, otherwise it is 0 or n depending on the value of c1)**
