The value of `pk` is assigned the result of `n / 2`. Since `n` is an even integer, `pk` will be an integer value representing half of `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer where `n` is even; `s` is the string input provided by the user; `pk` is `n / 2`.**
