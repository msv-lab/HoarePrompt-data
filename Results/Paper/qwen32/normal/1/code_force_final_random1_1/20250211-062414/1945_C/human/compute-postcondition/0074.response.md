The code snippet `s = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. This does not affect the values of `final`, `n`, or `t`.

Given the initial state:
- If the original length of `final` was 0, `final` is either `[0]` or `[n]` depending on the value of `c1`.
- If the original length of `final` was not 0, `final` remains `[1, 3]`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0.

After executing `s = input()`, the only new variable introduced is `s`, which holds the value of the user's input.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]; `n` is an input integer; `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` is the user's input.**
