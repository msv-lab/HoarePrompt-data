The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `n`, `final` will contain one element, which is `n`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list containing `n`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and is less than 50; `n`, `t`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `mini` remain unchanged.**
