To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the given information and the behavior of the loop.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n`: Length of the string `s`.
- `s`: The input string.
- `pk`: Set to `n / 2`.
- `sl`: List of characters from the string `s`.
- `o`: Count of '1's in the string `s`.
- `z`: Count of '0's in the string `s`.
- `zero`: Count of '0's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`.
- `one`: Count of '1's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`.
- `lst`: List of indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50%.
- `mini`: Smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`.
- `final`: An initially empty list.

### Loop Behavior:
The loop iterates over each element in `lst` and checks if the absolute difference between `pk` and the current element (`elem`) is equal to `mini`. If it is, `elem` is appended to `final`.

### Given Output States:
- After 1 iteration: `final` could be `[1]` if `abs(pk - 1) == mini`.
- After 2 iterations: `final` is `[3]` because `abs(pk - 3) == mini`.
- After 3 iterations: `final` could be `[1]` or `[]` depending on whether `abs(pk - 1) == mini`.

### Analysis:
From the given states, we can infer:
- `lst` contains at least `[1, 3]`.
- `mini` is `1` since `abs(2 - 3) == 1` and `abs(2 - 1) == 1`.

### Final Iteration:
Since `lst` contains `[1, 3]` and `mini` is `1`, both `1` and `3` will be checked against `mini`. Both `abs(pk - 1)` and `abs(pk - 3)` equal `1`, so both `1` and `3` will be appended to `final`.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations, `final` will contain both `1` and `3`.

### Output State:
Output State: **[1, 3]**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `final` list will contain the indices `1` and `3`.
