You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations, where `t` is the total number of test cases. For each test case, the loop has processed `m` queries, and for each query, it has printed the correct distance between the cities `x` and `y` based on the precomputed dictionaries `d1` and `d2`. The variables `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, and `y` do not retain their values from one test case to another; they are reinitialized for each new test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another based on the given problem description. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the cost using dictionaries `d1` and `d2`, which do not accurately represent the cumulative costs to reach each city using the closest city strategy.

Here’s a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Costs**:
   - The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are intended to store the cumulative cost to reach each city from the start or end, respectively, but they are not computed correctly.
   - For example, `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` only considers moving to the next closest city with a cost of 1, but it does not account for the actual distance if the closest city is not the next one.
   - Similarly, `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` does not correctly handle the distances when moving backward.

2. **Handling Queries**:
   - The program uses the differences in cumulative costs (`d1[y] - d1[x]` and `d2[y] - d2[x]`) to determine the cost of traveling from city `x` to city `y`. However, these differences do not accurately reflect the minimum cost based on the problem's rules.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Actual Output (Based on Provided Program):**
- The program will likely produce incorrect results because the cumulative cost calculations in `d1` and `d2` are flawed.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
1. Precomputing the closest city for each city.
2. Using dynamic programming or a similar method to compute the minimum cost to travel between cities using the closest city strategy.
3. Efficiently answering each query based on precomputed data.

Given the complexity of the problem and the need for accurate cost calculations, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
