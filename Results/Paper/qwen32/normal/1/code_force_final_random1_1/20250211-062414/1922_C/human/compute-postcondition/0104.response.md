To determine the output of the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `i` is `0`.
- `n` is at least `3`.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `d1` is a dictionary with keys from `3` to `n` and values calculated based on differences in `l`.
- `d2` is a dictionary where:
  - The value at key `n - 1` is set to `1`.
  - Values at keys from `n - 2` down to `1` are set according to specific conditions in a loop.
- `m` must be greater than `0`.
- `x` is the first input integer.
- `y` is the second input integer.
- `j` is `1`.
- If `y > x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Key Points to Consider:
- The exact values of `d2` depend on the loop conditions and the values of `l`, but we know `d2[n-1] = 1`.
- The relationship between `x` and `y` is given, but their exact values are not specified.
- The expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` will depend on the values assigned to `d2` at keys `y` and `x`.

### Analysis:
Since the exact values of `d2` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the values at keys `y` and `x` in the `d2` dictionary. The output will be the difference between these two values.

### Conclusion:
The `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement will output the difference between the values stored at keys `y` and `x` in the `d2` dictionary.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2 is the dictionary with keys from 1 to n-1 and values set according to the specified conditions)**
