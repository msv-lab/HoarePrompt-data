To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and implicitly `l` since it's used within the loop body but not directly in the loop head.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here's the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\)
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is either `1 + d1[i + 1]` if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, or `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` otherwise
- `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`
- `i` is `i + 1`

Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, and `d2`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop head.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Given that `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `(i + 1) + 1 = i + 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\), `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is either `1 + d1[i + 1]` if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, or `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` otherwise, `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, `i` is `i + 2`**
