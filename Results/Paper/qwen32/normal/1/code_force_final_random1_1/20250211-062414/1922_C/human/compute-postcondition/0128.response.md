The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `2`, and `n` is greater than `3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `1`, making it `3`. The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true, so `n` must be greater than `4`.

The state of `d1[4]` is determined by the logic inside the loop body, which is not provided, but since it is not part of the loop head, we do not need to adjust it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is `3`, `n` is greater than `4`**
