Given the code snippet `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]`, we need to update the value of `d2[i]` based on the existing value of `d2[i + 1]`.

From the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `n` is at least 3
- `l` remains the same list of integers
- `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`
- `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its value at key `n - 2` set to `2` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`. Otherwise, `d2` has its value at key `n - 2` set to `l[n - 2] - l[n - 3] + 1`.

The code updates `d2[i]` to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Since `i` is `n - 3`, `i + 1` is `n - 2`. Therefore, `d2[i]` (which is `d2[n - 3]`) is updated to `1 + d2[n - 2]`.

Thus, the updated state of `d2[n - 3]` is `1 + d2[n - 2]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is at least 3, `l` remains the same list of integers, `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`, `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1`, its value at key `n - 2` set to `2` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]` or `l[n - 2] - l[n - 3] + 1` otherwise, and its value at key `n - 3` set to `1 + d2[n - 2]`.**
