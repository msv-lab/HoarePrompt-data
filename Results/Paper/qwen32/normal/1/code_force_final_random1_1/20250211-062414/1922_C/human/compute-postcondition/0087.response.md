Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is at least 3, `l` remains the same list of integers, `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`. `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1`. If `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, `d2` has its value at key `n - 2` set to `2` and `d2[n - 3]` set to `1 + d2[n - 2]`. Otherwise, `d2` has its value at key `n - 2` set to `l[n - 2] - l[n - 3] + 1` and `d2[n - 3]` set to `l[n - 3] - l[n - 4] + d2[n - 2]`.**
