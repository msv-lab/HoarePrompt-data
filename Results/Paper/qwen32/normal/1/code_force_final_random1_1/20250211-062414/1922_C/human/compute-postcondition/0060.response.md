The given code snippet initializes a new `defaultdict` named `d2` with a default factory of `int`. This operation does not affect the existing variables `i`, `n`, `l`, or `d1`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `m`; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`.**
