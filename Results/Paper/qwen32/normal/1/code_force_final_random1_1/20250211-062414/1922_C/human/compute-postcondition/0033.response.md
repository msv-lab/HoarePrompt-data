Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\)
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the differences in the list `l` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \)
- `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`. If `l[4] - l[3] < l[5] - l[4]`, then `d2[4]` is `1 + d2[5]`. Otherwise, `d2[4]` is `l[4] - l[3]`.
- `i` is 3

Code Snippet:
```python
d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
```

Here, `i` is 3, so the code updates `d2[3]` to be `1 + d2[4]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` remains an integer such that \(n \geq 3\)
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` remains unchanged as a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`
- `d2` is updated such that `d2[3]` is now `1 + d2[4]`
- `i` remains 3

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` and `d2[3]` is `1 + d2[4]`; `i` is 3**
