Postcondition: **`i` is `0`, `n` is at least `3`, `l` remains the same list of integers, `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`, `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its values at keys from `n - 2` down to `1` set according to the conditions specified in the loop, `m` is greater than `0`, `x` is `x_new`, `y` is `y_new`, `j` is `2`. If `y_new` is greater than `x_new`, then `y_new` is greater than `x_new`. Otherwise, `y_new` is less than or equal to `x_new`.**
