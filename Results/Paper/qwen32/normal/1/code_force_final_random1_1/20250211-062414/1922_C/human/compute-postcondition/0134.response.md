To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will iterate starting from `i = n - 2` down to `i = 1` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

### Analysis:

1. **Range Function**: The `range(n - 2, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence starting from `n - 2` down to `1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 2` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `n - 2`. This matches the start of the range, so no adjustment is needed for `i` itself.

3. **Value of `n`**: For the loop to execute, `n - 2` must be at least `1`. Therefore, `n` must be at least `3`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- Ensure `n` is at least `3` so that `n - 2` is at least `1`, allowing the loop to execute at least once.
- No adjustment is needed for `i` since it is correctly set to `n - 2`.

### Final State:

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be at least `3`**

This ensures that the loop will execute with the correct initial conditions.
