Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` and `d1[2]` is 1; `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`. Additionally, the current element `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`.**
