The given code snippet initializes a new `defaultdict` named `d2` with a default factory of `int`. This does not affect the existing variables `t`, `n`, `l`, or `d1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`.**

This means that `d2` has been added to the existing state, while all other variables retain their initial values.
