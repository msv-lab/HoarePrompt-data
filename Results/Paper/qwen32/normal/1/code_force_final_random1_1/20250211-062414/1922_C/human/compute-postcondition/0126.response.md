To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
```

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `2`
- `n` is greater than `3`

Let's substitute `i` with `2` in the code snippet:

```python
d1[2 + 2] = l[2 + 1] - l[2] + d1[2 + 1]
```

This simplifies to:

```python
d1[4] = l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]
```

From this, we know that the value of `d1[4]` is updated based on the values of `l[3]`, `l[2]`, and `d1[3]`. 

The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `3`, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`**.
