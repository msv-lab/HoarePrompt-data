To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant parts of the code.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `i` is `0`
- `n` is at least `3`
- `l` is a list of integers
- `d1` is a dictionary with keys from `3` to `n` and values calculated based on the differences in `l`
- `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its values at keys from `n - 2` down to `1` set according to the conditions specified in the loop
- `m` is greater than `0`
- `x` is `x_new`
- `y` is `y_new`
- `j` is `2`
- If `y_new` is greater than `x_new`, then `y_new` is greater than `x_new`. Otherwise, `y_new` is less than or equal to `x_new`.

### Key Points to Consider:

- The specific values of `x_new` and `y_new` are not provided, but we know their relationship (`y_new > x_new` or `y_new <= x_new`).
- `d1` is a dictionary with keys from `3` to `n` and values calculated based on the differences in `l`. This means `d1[key]` is the difference between two elements in the list `l` for each key.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:

The print statement is `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`. To determine the output, we need to know the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

- `d1[y]` is the value in the dictionary `d1` corresponding to the key `y`, which is `y_new`.
- `d1[x]` is the value in the dictionary `d1` corresponding to the key `x`, which is `x_new`.

Since the exact values of `x_new` and `y_new` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical difference `d1[y] - d1[x]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the dictionary values.

### Conclusion:

The print statement will output the difference between the values of `d1` at keys `y` and `x`, where `y` is `y_new` and `x` is `x_new`.

Output: **d1[y_new] - d1[x_new] (where y_new and x_new are the values of y and x respectively, and d1 is the dictionary with keys from 3 to n and values calculated based on the differences in l)**
