The given code modifies the dictionary `d1` by setting the value at key `i + 2` to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is `2`, the key `i + 2` evaluates to `4` and the key `i + 1` evaluates to `3`.

Therefore, `d1[4]` is set to `1 + d1[3]`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `d1[3]`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `d1[4]`. However, we know that `d1[4]` will be `1` more than whatever `d1[3]` was.

The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `3`, `d1[4]` is `1 + d1[3]`**
