The given code initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with a default factory of `int`. This means that any key accessed in `d1` that does not exist will automatically be initialized to `0`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is equal to `m`
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a list of integers from the input

The only change made by the code is the creation of `d1`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is equal to `m`; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`.**
