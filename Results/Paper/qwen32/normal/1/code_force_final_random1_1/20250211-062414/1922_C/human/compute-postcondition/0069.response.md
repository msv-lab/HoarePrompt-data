The code updates the value of `d1` at the key `i + 2` to be `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Since `d1` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `int`, if `d1[i + 1]` does not exist, it defaults to `0`. Therefore, `d1[i + 2]` becomes `1`.

The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1[i + 1]`, and `d2` remain unchanged except for the specified update in `d1`.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` and `d1[i + 2]` is `1 + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`**.
