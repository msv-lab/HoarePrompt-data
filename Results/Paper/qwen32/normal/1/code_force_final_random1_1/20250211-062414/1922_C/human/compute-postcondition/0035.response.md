Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`. If `l[3] - l[2] < l[4] - l[3]`, then `d2[3]` is `1 + d2[4]`. Otherwise, `d2[3]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d2[4]`. If `l[4] - l[3] < l[5] - l[4]`, then `d2[4]` is `1 + d2[5]`. Otherwise, `d2[4]` is `l[4] - l[3]`. `i` is 3.**
