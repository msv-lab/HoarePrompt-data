To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will iterate over the range starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the range `(1, n - 1)` must contain at least one integer.

Let's analyze the conditions:
- The loop will start with `i = 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 1, which implies `n > 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `1`
- `n` is the input integer
- `l` is the new list of integers from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d1[2]` is `1`
- `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory
- `m` is greater than `0`
- `j` is `m - 1`

We only need to adjust `n` to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables (`i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than `2`**
