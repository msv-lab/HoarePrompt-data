The code snippet updates the value of `d2[i]` based on the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 4, `d2[4]` is set to `1 + d2[5]`.

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `d2[5]`, we can only express `d2[4]` in terms of `d2[5]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\), `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the differences in the list `l` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \), and `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d2[4]` is `1 + d2[5]`, `i` is 4**.
