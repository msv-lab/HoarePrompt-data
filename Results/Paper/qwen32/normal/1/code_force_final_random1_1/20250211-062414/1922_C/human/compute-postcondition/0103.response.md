To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined and used.

### Initial State Recap:
- `i` is `0`
- `n` is at least `3`
- `l` is a list of integers
- `d1` is a dictionary with keys from `3` to `n`, where the values are calculated based on differences in `l`
- `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its values at keys from `n - 2` down to `1` set according to specific conditions in a loop
- `m` must be greater than `0`
- `x` is the first input integer
- `y` is the second input integer
- `j` is `1`
- If `y` is greater than `x`, then `y > x`; otherwise, `y <= x`

### Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `d1` is a dictionary with keys from `3` to `n`.
- The values of `d1` are calculated based on differences in the list `l`.

However, the exact values of `d1` are not explicitly provided. We only know that they are derived from the list `l`.

Given the inputs `x` and `y`, the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` will compute the difference between the values of `d1` at keys `y` and `x`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement depends on the specific values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`, which are determined by the differences in the list `l` at the respective indices. Since the exact values of `d1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these values.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are values in the dictionary d1 calculated based on differences in the list l)**
