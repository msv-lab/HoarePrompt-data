The given code modifies the list `a` by setting `a[i]` to the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `a[0]` is `1000`, and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`. The rest of the elements in `a` (except the first and last) are initially `0`. The variable `i` starts at `1`.

Executing the line `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` changes `a[1]` to `a[0] + x[0]`, which means `a[1]` becomes `1000 + x[0]`.

Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the new input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `1000`, the second element `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, the last element `a[n-1]` is `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`, and the rest (except the first, second, and last) are `0`, `i` is 1**.
