The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged because it determines the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, and the third element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3**
