The given code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to a new list of `n` zeros. This means that the previous values stored in `a` (which were calculated based on the cumulative sums of elements in `x`) are discarded, and `a` now contains `n` zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `x` is the new list of `n` integers obtained from the new input, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, and `i` is `n-1`.**
