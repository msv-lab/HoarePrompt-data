The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `x`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Given that `n` is an input integer, it is assumed that the number of integers provided in the input matches `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input.**
