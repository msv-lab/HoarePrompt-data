You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of `n-1` integers, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 1000 and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum starting from 1000 plus the sum of the elements in `x` up to `x[i-1]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
Given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \), we need to construct an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
1. \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \leq i \leq n \).
2. \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
1. Reads the size of the array \( n \).
2. Reads the array \( x \) of size \( n-1 \).
3. Initializes an array \( a \) of size \( n \) with all elements set to 0.
4. Sets \( a[0] \) to 1000.
5. Iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) and sets \( a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).
6. Prints the array \( a \).

### Checking the Conditions:
- The program ensures that \( a[0] \) is set to 1000, which is within the range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).
- For each subsequent element \( a[i] \) (for \( i \geq 1 \)), it is calculated as \( a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] \). This means:
  - \( a[i] \) will be greater than \( a[i-1] \) because \( x[i-1] \geq 1 \).
  - \( a[i] \mod a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) \mod a[i-1] = x[i-1] \), which satisfies the condition \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \).

### Conclusion:
The program constructs the array \( a \) such that all conditions are satisfied. It ensures that each \( a_i \) is within the required range and that the modulo condition holds true for all \( i \geq 2 \).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
