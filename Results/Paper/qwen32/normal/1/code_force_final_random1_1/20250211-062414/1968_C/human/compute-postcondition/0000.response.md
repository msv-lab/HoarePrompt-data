In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute based on the value of `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in Loop Head**: The loop head contains `int(input())`, which means the loop will iterate based on the integer value read from input.
2. **Adjust State Based on Loop Head**: To ensure the loop executes, the value read from input (which corresponds to `t`) must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given the initial state, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that the input value will naturally satisfy the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute since `t` is guaranteed to be within the valid range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
