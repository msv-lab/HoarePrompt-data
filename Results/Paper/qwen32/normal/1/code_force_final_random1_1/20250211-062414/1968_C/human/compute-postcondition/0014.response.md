The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given that the initial state specifies that `n` is already an integer greater than 1, executing this line will overwrite the existing value of `n` with the new input value.

Since the value of `n` is being reassigned, the list `a` which depends on the original value of `n` and the list `x` will remain unchanged. The variable `i` which is set to `n-1` will also remain unchanged until it is recalculated based on the new value of `n`.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value of `n` obtained from the input, while `t`, `x`, `a`, and `i` retain their previous states except for `i` which should logically be recalculated as `n-1` based on the new `n`. However, since the task specifies to only update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code, we only update `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, the third element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., and the nth element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is n-1**.
