Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
- `n` is the number of integers in the list `x`.
- `x` is a list of `n` integers.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where:
  - `a[0] = 1000`
  - `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`
  - `a[2] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
  - ...
  - `a[n-1] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`
- `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*a)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Given the definition of `a`:
- The first element `a[0]` is always `1000`.
- Each subsequent element `a[k]` for \(k > 0\) is the sum of `1000` and the cumulative sum of the first \(k-1\) elements of `x`.

To illustrate with an example:
- Suppose `x = [10, 20, 30]`, then:
  - `a[0] = 1000`
  - `a[1] = 1000 + x[0] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
  - `a[2] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] = 1000 + 10 + 20 = 1030`
  - `a[3] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2] = 1000 + 10 + 20 + 30 = 1060`

Thus, if `x = [10, 20, 30]`, the list `a` would be `[1000, 1010, 1030, 1060]`.

### General Case:
For any list `x` of length `n`, the list `a` will be constructed as described above, starting with `1000` and adding the cumulative sums of the elements of `x`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2] (where x is the list of n integers)**
