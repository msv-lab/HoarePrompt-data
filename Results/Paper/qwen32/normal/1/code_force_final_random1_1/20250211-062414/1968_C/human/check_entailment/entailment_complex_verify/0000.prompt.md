You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 1000
        
        for i in range(1, n):

        print(*a)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of `n-1` integers, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 1000 and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum starting from 1000 plus the sum of the elements in `x` up to `x[i-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers, then outputs a list `a` of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum starting from 1000, incremented by the corresponding elements in `x`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
  - \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
  - \(x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).
- Given an array `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`, we need to construct the array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `a[0]` to 1000, which is within the allowed range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).
2. **Construction of `a` Array**:
   - For each subsequent element \(a_i\) (where \(i \geq 1\)), the program sets \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\).
   - This ensures that \(a_i > a_{i-1}\), and therefore \(a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}\) because \(a_i\) is constructed such that the remainder when divided by \(a_{i-1}\) is exactly \(x_{i-1}\).

### Verification:
- Let's verify this with the provided examples:
  - **First Test Case**: `n = 4`, `x = [2, 4, 1]`
    - `a[0] = 1000`
    - `a[1] = 1000 + 2 = 1002`
    - `a[2] = 1002 + 4 = 1006`
    - `a[3] = 1006 + 1 = 1007`
    - Checking the conditions:
      - \(1002 \mod 1000 = 2\)
      - \(1006 \mod 1002 = 4\)
      - \(1007 \mod 1006 = 1\)
    - All conditions are satisfied.
  
  - **Second Test Case**: `n = 3`, `x = [1, 1]`
    - `a[0] = 1000`
    - `a[1] = 1000 + 1 = 1001`
    - `a[2] = 1001 + 1 = 1002`
    - Checking the conditions:
      - \(1001 \mod 1000 = 1\)
      - \(1002 \mod 1001 = 1\)
    - All conditions are satisfied.

  - **Third Test Case**: `n = 6`, `x = [4, 2, 5, 1, 2]`
    - `a[0] = 1000`
    - `a[1] = 1000 + 4 = 1004`
    - `a[2] = 1004 + 2 = 1006`
    - `a[3] = 1006 + 5 = 1011`
    - `a[4] = 1011 + 1 = 1012`
    - `a[5] = 1012 + 2 = 1014`
    - Checking the conditions:
      - \(1004 \mod 1000 = 4\)
      - \(1006 \mod 1004 = 2\)
      - \(1011 \mod 1006 = 5\)
      - \(1012 \mod 1011 = 1\)
      - \(1014 \mod 1012 = 2\)
    - All conditions are satisfied.

  - **Fourth Test Case**: `n = 2`, `x = [500]`
    - `a[0] = 1000`
    - `a[1] = 1000 + 500 = 1500`
    - Checking the conditions:
      - \(1500 \mod 1000 = 500\)
    - All conditions are satisfied.

  - **Fifth Test Case**: `n = 3`, `x = [1, 5]`
    - `a[0] = 1000`
    - `a[1] = 1000 + 1 = 1001`
    - `a[2] = 1001 + 5 = 1006`
    - Checking the conditions:
      - \(1001 \mod 1000 = 1\)
      - \(1006 \mod 1001 = 5\)
    - All conditions are satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The provided program constructs the array `a` such that all conditions specified in the problem description are met. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail.

**Correctness: True**.
