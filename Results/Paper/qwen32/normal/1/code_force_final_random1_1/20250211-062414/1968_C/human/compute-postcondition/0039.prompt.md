Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 1000
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, the third element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., and the nth element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is n-1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the new input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 1000`, `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`, `a[2] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`, and `i` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is the new list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 1000 and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
