Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'` or 1 if no such index exists, `i` is `n-2`, `res` is the new input value. If `res` is `'<'`, then `best` is `n-2`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.**
