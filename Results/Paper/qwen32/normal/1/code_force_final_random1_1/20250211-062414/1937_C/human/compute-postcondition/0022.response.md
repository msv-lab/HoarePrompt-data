Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'` or `1` if no such index exists.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `best` is set to `0`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement outputs a series of values separated by spaces.
- The first value is a literal question mark `'?'`.
- The second value is `k`, which is described as the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'` or `1` if no such index exists.
- The third value is `best`, which is explicitly stated to be `0`.
- The fourth value is `k` again, so it will be the same as the second value.
- The fifth value is `i`, which is explicitly stated to be `n`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `best` is explicitly `0` and `i` is explicitly `n`, these values are straightforward.
- `k` is described but its exact value depends on the responses received in some prior part of the program logic, but it is guaranteed to be either `1` or the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) where the response was `'<'`.

Given this, the output will be:
Output: **? [k] 0 [k] [n] (where [k] is the largest index i from 2 to n-1 for which the response was '<' or 1 if no such index exists, and [n] is the value of n)**
