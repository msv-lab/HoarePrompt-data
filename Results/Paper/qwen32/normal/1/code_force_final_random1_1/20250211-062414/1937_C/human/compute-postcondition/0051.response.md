The value of `k` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is defined as `n-1 + 1`, which simplifies to `n`, the value of `k` becomes `n`. The values of `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `res` is the new input string, `i` is `n`, `k` is `n`**.
