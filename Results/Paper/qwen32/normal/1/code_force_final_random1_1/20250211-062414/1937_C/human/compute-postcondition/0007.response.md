The given code snippet attempts to assign the value of `i` to `k`. However, there is no definition or assignment of `i` in the initial state provided. Since `i` is not defined, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, we can only state that `k` will take on whatever value `i` holds.

Given that `k` was initially set to 1, and assuming `i` is defined elsewhere in the actual code (which is not provided here), the new value of `k` would be whatever `i` is. Since `i` is not specified, we can't give a concrete value for `k`.

However, based on the information provided and the operation performed, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the value of `i`, `res` is the string input by the user, and `res` is equal to '<'.**

In natural language, this means that `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` remains greater than 2, `k` now holds the value of `i` (which is undefined in the given context), `res` remains the string input by the user, and `res` is still equal to '<'.
