In the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range function generates any values. The range function `range(2, n)` will generate values starting from 2 up to, but not including, `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2.

Let's analyze the given state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (this variable is not used in the loop head and thus does not affect the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer (this variable is used in the loop head).
- `k` is 1 (this variable is not used in the loop head and thus does not affect the loop execution).

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the value of `n` to be greater than 2. The variables `t` and `k` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is 1**
