Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the previous value of `n` + 1 if `res` equals '<', otherwise `k` remains 1, `i` is the previous value of `n` + 1, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<', `res` is the user input.**
