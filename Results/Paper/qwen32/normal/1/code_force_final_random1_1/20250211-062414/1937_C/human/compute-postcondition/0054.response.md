To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the print statement:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is greater than 2.
  - `res` is the new input string (though it is not used in the print statement).
  - `i` is set to `n + 1`.

- **Print Statement**:
  ```python
  print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
  ```

From the initial state, we know the following:
- `n > 2`
- `i = n + 1`
- `k` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value from the given information.

Given this, the print statement will output:
- `'?'`: A literal question mark character.
- `0`: A literal zero.
- `k`: The value of the variable `k`, which is unknown from the provided information.
- `0`: Another literal zero.
- `i`: The value of `i`, which is `n + 1`.

Since `k` is not specified, we cannot provide its exact value. Therefore, we will represent it as `k` in the output.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 k 0 i (where i is n + 1 and k is the value of k)**
