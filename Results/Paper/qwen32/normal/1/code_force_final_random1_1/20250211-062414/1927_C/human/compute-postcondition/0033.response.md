The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only terminates the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Given that there is no loop or conditional block shown in the context, the `break` statement would not have any effect on the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, or `i`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 2; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 2.**
