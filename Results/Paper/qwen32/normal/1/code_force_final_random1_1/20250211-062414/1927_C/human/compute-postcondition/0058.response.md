The given code snippet reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `b`. This means the previous list stored in `b` is overwritten by the new list of integers.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the integers read from the input.
- `a` remains the list of integers read from the input.
- `b` is now a new list of integers read from the input.
- `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain integers representing the counts as per the loop logic.
- `newk` remains `k // 2`.
- `i` remains `k + 1`.
- The condition in the if statement (`if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk`) remains based on the previous values of `aOnes` and `bOnes`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers representing the counts as per the loop logic; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is `k + 1`.**
