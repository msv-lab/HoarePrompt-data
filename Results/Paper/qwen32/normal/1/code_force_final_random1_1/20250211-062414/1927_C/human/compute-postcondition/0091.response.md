Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 2; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 2. If `i` (which is 2) is in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If none of these conditions are met, no changes are made to `aOnes` or `bOnes`.**
