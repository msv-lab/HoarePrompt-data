Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the situation:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input.
- `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers representing the counts of ones in some part of the lists `a` and `b` respectively.
- `newk` is calculated as `k // 2`.
- `i` is set to `k + 1`.
- At this point, `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('yes')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `newk`, or `i`. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **yes**
