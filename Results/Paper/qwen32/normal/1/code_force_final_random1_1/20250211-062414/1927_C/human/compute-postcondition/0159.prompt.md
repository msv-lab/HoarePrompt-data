Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `i` is 2; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now 1 and `bOnes` is 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `aOnes` remains unchanged. Similarly, `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `bOnes` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 2; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `i` is 3; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now 1 and `bOnes` is 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `aOnes` remains unchanged. Similarly, `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `bOnes` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 2; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `i` is 4; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is set to 1 and `bOnes` is set to 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, and `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` are adjusted according to whether `i` is in `a` or `b` and their respective values relative to `newk`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
