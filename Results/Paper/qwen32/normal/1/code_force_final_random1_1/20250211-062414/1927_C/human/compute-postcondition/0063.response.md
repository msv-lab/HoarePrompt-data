To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `i <= k`. The variables involved in this condition are `i` and `k`.

Given:
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `k` is an integer read from the input.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `i <= k` must be true when the loop starts. Since `i` is initialized to 1, `k` must be at least 1 for the condition to hold true.

However, since `k` is already defined as an integer read from the input, we don't need to change its value. We just need to ensure that `k` is at least 1, which is a reasonable assumption given that `k` is an integer input.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `i` or `k` because the initial value of `i` (which is 1) will satisfy the condition `i <= k` as long as `k` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1**
