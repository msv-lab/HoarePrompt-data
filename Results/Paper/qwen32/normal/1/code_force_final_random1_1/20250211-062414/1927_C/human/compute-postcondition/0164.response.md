Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 1`; `newk` is `k // 2`; `aOnes` and `bOnes` reflect the number of times `i` was found in `a` and `b` respectively, up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations. Either `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, or at least one of them does not equal `newk`.**
