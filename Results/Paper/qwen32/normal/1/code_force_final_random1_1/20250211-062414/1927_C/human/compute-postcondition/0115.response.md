Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `bOnes` has been explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as they have not been modified by the provided code snippet.
