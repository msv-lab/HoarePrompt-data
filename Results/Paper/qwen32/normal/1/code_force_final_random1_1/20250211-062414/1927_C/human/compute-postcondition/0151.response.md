Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 2; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `i` is 3; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` before the if-else block, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and `bOnes` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, and `bOnes` is either 1 or 2.**
