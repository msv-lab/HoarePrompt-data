Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · min(n, m). a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each element b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
        elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers representing the counts as per the loop logic; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is `k + 1`. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, the condition in the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition in the if statement is not satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is the final count of increments based on the loop logic; `bOnes` is the final count of increments based on the loop logic; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is `k + 1`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk`, or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`, or both.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `i` is `k + 1`; `newk` is `k // 2`; `aOnes` and `bOnes` reflect the number of times `i` was found in `a` and `b` respectively, up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations. Either `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, or at least one of them does not equal `newk`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
