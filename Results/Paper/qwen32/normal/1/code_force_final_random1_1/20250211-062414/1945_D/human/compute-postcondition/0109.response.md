The code snippet adds the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to `total`. Given that `v` is initially -1, `total` will be updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. Since `total` was initially 0, the new value of `total` will be `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`.

The value of `best` remains unchanged because the condition for updating `best` (whether `best` was initially greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) does not affect the value of `best` directly in this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1 (must be non-negative), `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, and `best` is either 10^12 or `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was initially greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**
