To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables involved.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `y` in the list `a`.
- For each iteration, the integer value of `y` is appended to the list `a_values`.
- No changes are made to `custo`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `custos`, `b_values`, `nf`, or `b` within the loop.

### Given Information:
- After 1 iteration: `a_values` contains one integer value.
- After 2 iterations: `a_values` contains two integer values.
- After 3 iterations: `a_values` contains three integer values.

### Conclusion:
The loop will continue to iterate until all elements in the list `a` have been processed. Therefore, after all iterations, `a_values` will contain the integer values of all elements in `a`.

### Final Output State:
- `custo` remains 0.
- `num_fila` remains the integer value of the first element in `nf`.
- `max_p` remains the integer value of the second element in `nf`.
- `custos` includes the current value of `custo` (which is 0).
- `a_values` will contain the integer values of all elements in `a`.
- `b_values` remains an empty list.
- `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input.
- `a` remains a list of substrings from the latest input.
- `b` remains a list of substrings from the input.

Output State: **`custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input, `b` is a list of substrings from the input.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `a_values` will have converted all string elements from `a` into integers, while all other variables will retain their initial values as described.
