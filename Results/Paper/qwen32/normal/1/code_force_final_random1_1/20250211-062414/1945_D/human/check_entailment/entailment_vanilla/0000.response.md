Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

- **Objective**: Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue with the minimum cost.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - To swap with a person at position `j`, Kirill pays `a_j`.
  - For every person between `j` and `i` (exclusive), Kirill pays `b_k`.
- **Constraints**:
  - Kirill can perform swaps multiple times.
  - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

### Solution Analysis:

The provided solution iterates through the queue from the back to the front, trying to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `total` is initialized to `0`, representing the accumulated cost.
   - `best` is initialized to a very large number (`10^12`), representing the best (minimum) cost found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the Queue**:
   - The loop iterates from the last person in the queue to the first.
   - If the current position `v` is within the first `m` positions (`v <= pos_final`), it checks if the cost to swap directly to this position (`total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current `best`. If so, it updates `best`.
   - It then decides whether to add `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total` based on which is smaller.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - If `v` is within the first `m` positions, the decision is made to minimize the direct swap cost (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) or the passing cost (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).
   - If `v` is beyond the first `m` positions, it only adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

### Issues with the Solution:

- **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
  - The logic for adding costs to `total` is flawed. The code adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total` regardless of whether the swap actually happens or not.
  - This means that the `total` cost does not accurately reflect the actual cost incurred to reach the first `m` positions.

- **Logic for Best Cost**:
  - The `best` variable is updated only when `v` is within the first `m` positions, but the logic for updating `best` does not consider the actual path taken to reach that position. It simply compares the direct swap cost without considering the accumulated cost of previous swaps.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the cost calculation and the logic for determining the best cost, the provided solution is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
