The code snippet adds the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. Given that `v` is -1, `total` will be updated to include the value at index -1 of the list `custo_pra_passar_b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1 (must be non-negative), `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`, `best` is 10^12, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
