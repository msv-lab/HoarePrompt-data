The code snippet `nf = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `nf`. This operation does not affect the values of `custo`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `i`, `custos`, `a_values`, or `b_values`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`custo` is 0, `num_fila` is 0, `max_p` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input.**
