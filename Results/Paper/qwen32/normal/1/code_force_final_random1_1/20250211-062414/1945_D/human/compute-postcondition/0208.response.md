Output State: **`custo` is 140, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes [120, 140], `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `custo` (which is 140) has been appended to the list `custos`. Now, `custos` contains the values [120, 140]. All other variables remain unchanged.
