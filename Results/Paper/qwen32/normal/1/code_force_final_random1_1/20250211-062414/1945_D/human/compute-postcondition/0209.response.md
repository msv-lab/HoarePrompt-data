To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop behaves based on the provided information. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Loop Behavior Recap:
1. **Initialization**: For each iteration, `custo` is initialized to 0, and `num_fila` and `max_p` are read from the input.
2. **List Initialization**: Lists `a_values` and `b_values` are populated with integers from the input.
3. **First Loop (Descending)**: From `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`, the code adds the smaller value between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to `custo`.
4. **Second Loop (Descending)**: From `max_p - 1` down to 1, the code checks if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`. If true, it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo` and potentially `a_values[0]` if `y` reaches 1. Otherwise, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo` and breaks out of the loop.
5. **Appending to `custos`**: After both loops, the value of `custo` is appended to the list `custos`.

### Given Information:
- **After 1st Iteration**: `custos` includes one element.
- **After 2nd Iteration**: `custos` includes two elements.
- **After 3rd Iteration**: `custos` includes `[120, 140]`, and `custo` is 140 with specific `a_values` and `b_values`.

### Inference:
- Since `x` is the number of iterations and we have the results of the first three iterations, we can infer that `x` is at least 3.
- The problem does not specify further iterations, so we assume `x` is exactly 3 based on the given information.

### Final Output State:
- **`custos`**: After the third iteration, `custos` contains `[120, 140]`.
- **Other Variables**: The variables `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, and `b` are specific to each iteration and do not persist across iterations unless specified otherwise.

### Conclusion:
Since the problem specifies only the first three iterations and no further details about additional iterations, we conclude that the loop has executed exactly three times.

Output State: **custos = [120, 140]**, all other variables are as per their last iteration values.
