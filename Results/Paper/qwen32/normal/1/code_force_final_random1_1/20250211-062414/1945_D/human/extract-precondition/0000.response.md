Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. b is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
