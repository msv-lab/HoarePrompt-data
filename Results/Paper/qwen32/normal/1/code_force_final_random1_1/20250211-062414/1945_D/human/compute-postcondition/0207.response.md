Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step-by-step to determine the final output state after all iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs from `y = max_p - 1` down to `1` (inclusive). Given `max_p` is `2`, the loop will run for `y = 1`.

### Initial State:
- `custo` is 120
- `num_fila` is 5
- `max_p` is 2
- `custos` includes 120
- `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
- `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60]
- `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged

### Iteration Details:
#### First Iteration (`y = 1`):
- Condition: `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`
- Substituting values: `a_values[0] + b_values[1] <= a_values[1]` → `10 + 25 <= 20` → `35 <= 20` (False)
- Since the condition is False, `custo += a_values[y]` → `custo += 20` → `custo = 140`
- The `else` block has a `break` statement, so the loop terminates after the first iteration.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes, the state of the variables is:
- `custo` is 140
- `num_fila` remains 5
- `max_p` remains 2
- `custos` remains [120]
- `a_values` remains [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
- `b_values` remains [15, 25, 35, 45, 60]
- `nf`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged

### Conclusion:
The loop only runs once because of the `break` statement in the `else` block. Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **custo is 140, num_fila is 5, max_p is 2, custos includes 120, a_values is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], b_values is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], nf, a, and b are unchanged.**
