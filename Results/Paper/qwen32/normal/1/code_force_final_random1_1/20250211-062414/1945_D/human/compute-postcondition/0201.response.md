The code increments the value of `custo` by the first element of `a_values`, which is 10. Therefore, `custo` changes from 135 to 145. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`custo` is 145, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 1.**
