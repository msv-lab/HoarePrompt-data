The only variable in the loop head is `y`, which iterates over the elements in the list `a`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `y` to the next element in the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `custo` is 0
- `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`
- `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`
- `custos` includes the current value of `custo`
- `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y`
- `b_values` is an empty list
- `nf` is a list of substrings from the input
- `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input that must have at least 1 element
- `b` is a list of substrings from the input

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was the last element processed from the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be the next element in `a` if there are any remaining elements.

Let's assume that `a` has more than one element, and `y` was the first element in the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be the second element in `a`.

State: **`custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the previous `y`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of substrings from the input, `y` is the next element in `a`**
