Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `total` is 0, `best` is the minimum cost encountered up to `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The value of `total` has been reset to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
