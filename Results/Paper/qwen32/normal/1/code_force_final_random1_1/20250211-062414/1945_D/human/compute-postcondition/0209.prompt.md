Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an input integer; `custos` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    custo = 0
    num_fila = 0
    max_p = 0
    a_values = []
    b_values = []
    nf = input().split()
    num_fila = int(nf[0])
    max_p = int(nf[1])
    a = input().split()
    b = input().split()
    for y in a:
        a_values.append(int(y))
    for y in b:
        b_values.append(int(y))
    for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
        if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
            custo += a_values[y]
        else:
            custo += b_values[y]
    for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
        if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
            custo += b_values[y]
            if y == 1:
                custo += a_values[0]
                break
        else:
            custo += a_values[y]
            break
    custos.append(custo)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for `y` ranging from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`, plus any additional `b_values[y]` added when `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, and `a_values[0]` if `y` reaches `1` and the condition holds; `custos` includes the new element `custo` at the end of the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final value of `custo` is determined by the conditions evaluated at `y = 1`. If `a_values[0] + b_values[1] <= a_values[1]`, then `custo` is increased by `b_values[1] + a_values[0]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `a_values[1]`. The list `custos` now includes the current value of `custo`. All other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `custo` is 140, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes [120, 140], `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
