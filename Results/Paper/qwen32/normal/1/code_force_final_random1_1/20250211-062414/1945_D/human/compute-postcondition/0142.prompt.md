Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = 10 ** 12
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer such that `na_frente` ≥ 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` to `0`, `best` is the minimum cost encountered up to `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, cases is greater than or equal to 1, c is 1, na_frente is the first integer read from input minus 1, pos_final is the second integer read from input minus 2, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers read from input, custo_pra_passar_b is a new list of integers read from input, v is -1, total is the accumulated minimum cost from na_frente to 0, best is the minimum cost encountered when switching up to pos_final.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, cases is greater than or equal to 1, c is 2, na_frente is the first integer read from input minus 1, pos_final is the second integer read from input minus 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers read from input, custo_pra_passar_b is a new list of integers read from input, v is -1, total is the accumulated cost based on the minimum costs between custo_pra_trocar_a[v] and custo_pra_passar_b[v] for all v from na_frente down to 0, best is the minimum value of total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] for all v where v was less than or equal to pos_final.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
