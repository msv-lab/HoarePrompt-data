Postcondition: **`custo` is 155 if `y` is 1 and the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is 130. `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 1.**
