Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer such that `na_frente` ≥ 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]` to its previous value. Otherwise, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its previous value.**
