The code snippet adds the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. Given that `total` was initially 0, the new value of `total` will be equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is 10, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
