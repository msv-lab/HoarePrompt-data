The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. This means the values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` will be updated based on the new input, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` to `0`, `best` is the minimum cost encountered up to `pos_final`**. 

In simpler terms, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are updated to the new values read from the input, while all other variables retain their previous values.
