The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The initial state of `t`, `cases`, and `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input.**
