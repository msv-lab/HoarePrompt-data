Postcondition: **`q` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 0, `n` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 4. If `x` is divisible by 4 (`x % i == 0`), then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x // 4` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`. Otherwise, the state of `ans` remains unchanged.**
