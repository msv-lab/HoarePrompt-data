Output State: **`q` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 0, `n` is the second integer from the input, `ans` is `max(ans, x // i)`, and `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `x // i > 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
