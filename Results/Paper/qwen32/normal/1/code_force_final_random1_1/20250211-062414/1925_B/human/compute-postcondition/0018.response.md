To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the problem statement, we know:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4.
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Since `i` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 5. The other variables in the loop head (`1` and `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`) remain unchanged as they define the range of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`q` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 0, `n` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 5**.
