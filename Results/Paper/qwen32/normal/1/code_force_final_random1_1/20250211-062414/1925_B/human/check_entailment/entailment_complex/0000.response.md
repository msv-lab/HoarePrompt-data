### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum equals `x`. The key insight here is that the balance is maximized when the common divisor `d` of the sub-problems' difficulties is as large as possible.

The provided solution iterates over potential divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if it's possible to distribute the total difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems, each with a difficulty of `i` or `x // i`. Specifically, it verifies that `(x - n * i)` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, and similarly for `x // i`.

If both conditions are met, it updates the answer `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the divisor `i` or `x // i`.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible divisors efficiently and find the largest one that satisfies the constraints. Given the constraints (with `x` up to \(10^8\)), iterating up to the square root of `x` is computationally feasible.

### Conclusion:

The logic and implementation of the provided code correctly solve the problem by finding the maximum possible GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties under the given constraints.
