### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum balance, which is essentially the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems, when breaking a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems. The goal is to maximize this GCD.

The provided program iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if it's possible to split `x` into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty of `i` or `x // i` (the corresponding pair divisor). Specifically, it checks if `(x - n * i)` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, and similarly for `x // i`.

If both conditions are satisfied, it updates the answer (`ans`) to be the maximum of the current `ans` and the divisor `i` or `x // i`.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to split `x` into `n` parts with a common divisor, and it efficiently finds the maximum possible GCD by leveraging the properties of divisors.

### Verification with Example Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
   - Checking:
     - For `i = 1`: `(10 - 3*1) % 1 == 0` → Valid, `ans = 1`
     - For `i = 2`: `(10 - 3*2) % 2 == 0` → Valid, `ans = 2`
     - For `i = 5`: `(10 - 3*5) % 5 != 0` → Invalid
     - For `i = 10`: `(10 - 3*10) % 10 != 0` → Invalid
   - Maximum balance: `2`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - Divisors of 5: 1, 5
   - Checking:
     - For `i = 1`: `(5 - 5*1) % 1 == 0` → Valid, `ans = 1`
     - For `i = 5`: `(5 - 5*5) % 5 != 0` → Invalid
   - Maximum balance: `1`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - Divisors of 420: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420
   - Checking:
     - For `i = 6`: `(420 - 69*6) % 6 == 0` → Valid, `ans = 6`
     - Other divisors do not satisfy the condition.
   - Maximum balance: `6`

The program correctly handles these test cases and finds the maximum balance for each scenario.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance by checking all possible divisors and ensuring that the conditions for splitting `x` into `n` parts with a common divisor are met.

**Correctness: True**
