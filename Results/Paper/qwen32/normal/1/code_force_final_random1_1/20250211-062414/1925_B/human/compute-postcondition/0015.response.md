Output State: **`q` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 0, `n` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 4, `ans` is `max(ans, x // 4)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (which is at least 4 under certain conditions) and the integer division of `x` by `4`. The values of `q`, `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
