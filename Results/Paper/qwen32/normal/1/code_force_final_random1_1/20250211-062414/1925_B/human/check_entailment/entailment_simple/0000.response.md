### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`. The key insight here is that the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties must be a divisor of `x`.

The algorithm iterates through all divisors of `x` up to its square root. For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
1. If `i` can be used `n` times to form a sum less than or equal to `x` and the remaining part `(x - n * i)` is divisible by `i`.
2. Similarly, it checks the same conditions for the corresponding larger divisor `x // i`.

If either condition holds true, it updates the answer `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the divisor `i` (or `x // i`).

This approach ensures that we consider all possible divisors of `x` that could potentially be the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties. Since the GCD must divide `x`, and we are iterating over all possible divisors, this method is sound.

### Correctness:

Given the above explanation, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties. It efficiently checks all possible divisors and ensures that the conditions for forming valid sub-problems are met.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
