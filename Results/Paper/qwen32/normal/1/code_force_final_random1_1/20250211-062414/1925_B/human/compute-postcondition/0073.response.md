To determine the new state after executing the given code, let's analyze the impact of the line `ans = max(ans, x // i)`.

Given:
- `q` is 3
- `x` is at least 1
- `n` is the second integer from the input
- `i` is 4
- If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is at least 4

The line `ans = max(ans, x // i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the integer division of `x` by `i`.

Since the exact value of `ans` before this line is not specified, we'll denote it as `ans` (initial).

After the line executes, `ans` will be updated to `max(ans, x // 4)`.

The values of `q`, `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is 3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 4, `ans` is `max(ans, x // 4)`.**
