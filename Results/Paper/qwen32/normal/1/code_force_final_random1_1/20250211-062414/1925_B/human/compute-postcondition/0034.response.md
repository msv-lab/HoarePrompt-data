Postcondition: **`q` is 1, `x` is `input_x` (where `input_x` must be at least 1), `n` is `input_n`, and `ans` is `max(1, i)` if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`; otherwise, `ans` remains 1. Additionally, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). The current value of `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)` is 0.**
