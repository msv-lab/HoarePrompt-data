In this task, the only variable in the loop head is `q`. The loop iterates `int(input())` times, and `q` is the loop variable that increments with each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `q` is 1
- `x` is `input_x`
- `n` is `input_n`
- `ans` is the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d >= 0` and `(x - n * d) % d == 0`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- Since `q` is the loop variable and it increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `q` should be incremented by 1 from its current value (which is 1).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `q` will be 2
- `x`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop variable `q`.

State: **`q` is 2, `x` is `input_x`, `n` is `input_n`, and `ans` is the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d >= 0` and `(x - n * d) % d == 0`**
