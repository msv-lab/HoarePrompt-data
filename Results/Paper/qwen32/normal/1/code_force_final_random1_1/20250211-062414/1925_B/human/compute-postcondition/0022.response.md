Postcondition: **`q` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 0, `n` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 5. If `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is set to `max(ans, x // 5)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
