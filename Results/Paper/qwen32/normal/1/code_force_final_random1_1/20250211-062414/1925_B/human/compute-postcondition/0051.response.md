To determine the value of `ans` that will be printed, let's break down the given information and the conditions specified:

- `q` is set to 1.
- `x` is `input_x`, which means `x` takes the value of whatever `input_x` is.
- `n` is `input_n`, which means `n` takes the value of whatever `input_n` is.
- `ans` is defined as the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d >= 0` and `(x - n * d) % d == 0`.

Let's analyze the conditions for `ans`:
1. `d` must be a divisor of `x`.
2. `x - n * d` must be non-negative (`x - n * d >= 0`).
3. `x - n * d` must be divisible by `d` (`(x - n * d) % d == 0`).

Given these conditions, `ans` is essentially the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d` is a multiple of `d` and non-negative. This implies that `x - n * d` should be zero or a positive multiple of `d`.

To find `ans`:
- We need to check all divisors of `x` from largest to smallest.
- For each divisor `d`, check if `x - n * d >= 0` and `(x - n * d) % d == 0`.
- The first divisor that satisfies both conditions is `ans`.

Since the exact values of `input_x` and `input_n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor d of x such that x - n * d >= 0 and (x - n * d) % d == 0)**
