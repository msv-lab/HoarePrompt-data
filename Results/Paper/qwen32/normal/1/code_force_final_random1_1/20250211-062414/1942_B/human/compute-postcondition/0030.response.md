To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `ar`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

### Analysis of the Loop Head Variables:
- `i`: This is the current index being processed. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and it will be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- `ar`: This is the list of integers. Its contents do not change during the loop iterations.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element.
- `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`.
- `mex` is updated based on the condition `mex > mex - ar[i]`.

### Adjusting the State:
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1` (since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time).

### Example Adjustment:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `2` (meaning the loop just finished processing `ar[2]`), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `1` (to process `ar[1]`).

### General Case:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

### Final State:
Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i - 1` (assuming `i` was the value at the end of the previous iteration).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged. `i` is `i - 1`**.

However, since we need to specify a concrete state, let's assume the previous `i` was `k`, so the new `i` should be `k - 1`. If we don't have a specific `k`, we can denote the new `i` as `len(ar) - 2` if the previous `i` was `len(ar) - 1`.

For concreteness, assuming the previous `i` was `len(ar) - 1` (the first iteration):

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged. `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**.

If we don't have a specific previous `i`, the most general form would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged. `i` is `i - 1`**.

But for a specific example, let's assume `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged. `i` is 1**.
