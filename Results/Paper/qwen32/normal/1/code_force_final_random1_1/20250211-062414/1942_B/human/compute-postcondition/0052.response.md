The code snippet `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from it. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified elsewhere in the code.

Given the initial state, the new value of `mex` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. `i` is decremented by 1. `mex` is now `mex - ar[i]`.**
