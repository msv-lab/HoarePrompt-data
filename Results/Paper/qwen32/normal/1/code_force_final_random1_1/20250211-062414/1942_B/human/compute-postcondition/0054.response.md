The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1. Therefore, to execute one more time, `i` should be the value it had before being decremented.

Given that the loop runs from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`, if `i` is currently `-1` (which would mean the loop just finished), then there are no more iterations to perform. Otherwise, `i` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Let's assume `i` is currently `-1` (the loop just finished). To execute one more time, `i` should be `len(ar) - 1`. However, since the problem asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, and we know the loop has just finished, there is no "next iteration" to start. But if we consider the state right before the loop finishes, `i` would be `0`.

So, if the loop has not yet finished, `i` should be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` and subsequently `mex` is set to `mex - ar[i]`. `i` is decremented by 1. If the current value of `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` remains unchanged and `i` is still decremented by 1. `i` is incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.**

However, since the task specifies the state at the start of the next iteration and the loop might have just finished, we should consider the state right before the loop finishes:

If `i` is currently `0` (meaning the next decrement will finish the loop), then the state at the start of this iteration (before `i` was decremented) would have `i` as `1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` and subsequently `mex` is set to `mex - ar[i]`. `i` is decremented by 1. If the current value of `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` remains unchanged and `i` is still decremented by 1. `i` is 1 to start the next iteration.**

But generally, if the loop has not finished and `i` is currently `-1`, the correct state to represent the start of the loop would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` and subsequently `mex` is set to `mex - ar[i]`. `i` is decremented by 1. If the current value of `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` remains unchanged and `i` is still decremented by 1. `i` is len(ar) - 1 to start the next iteration.**

Since the problem does not specify the exact position of `i` when the state is given, we consider the general case where the loop has not finished:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` and subsequently `mex` is set to `mex - ar[i]`. `i` is decremented by 1. If the current value of `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` remains unchanged and `i` is still decremented by 1. `i` is incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.**

But to be precise and considering the loop structure:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` and subsequently `mex` is set to `mex - ar[i]`. `i` is decremented by 1. If the current value of `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` remains unchanged and `i` is still decremented by 1. `i` is len(ar) - 1 to start the next iteration.**

Given the loop structure and the requirement to represent the state at the start of the next iteration:

If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` and subsequently `mex` is set to `mex - ar[i]`. `i` is decremented by 1. If the current value of `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` remains unchanged and `i` is still decremented by 1. `i` is len(ar) - 1 to start the next iteration.**
