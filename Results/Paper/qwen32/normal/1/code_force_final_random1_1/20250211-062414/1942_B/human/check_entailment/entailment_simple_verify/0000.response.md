### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \) using the relation:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

The goal is to find \( p_i \) such that:
\[ p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{i-1}) - a_i \]

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) by iterating from the end of the array \( a \) to the beginning. It uses a variable `mex` initialized to \( n \) and updates it based on the values in \( a \).

Here is the annotated code again for clarity:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))
```

#### Annotations and State Analysis:
- **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to \( n \).
- **Iteration**: The loop iterates from the last index to the first index of `ar`.
- **Calculation**: For each index `i`, `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.
- **Update**: If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

#### Evaluation:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The program does not maintain a set of used numbers to correctly compute the MEX at each step. Instead, it relies on a simple decrement operation which might not reflect the actual smallest unused number.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program might fail for specific inputs where the sequence of `a` values requires a more precise calculation of MEX.

#### Testing with Example Inputs:
Let's consider the provided example inputs:

##### Example 1:
```
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
The program outputs:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```
This output seems correct based on the problem description.

##### Example 2:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
The program outputs:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```
This output also seems correct.

##### Example 3:
```
3
-2 1 2
```
The program outputs:
```
2 0 1
```
This output is correct as well.

#### Constructing a Counterexample:
To demonstrate the potential issue, let's construct a counterexample where the program might fail:

##### Counterexample:
```
3
0 1 0
```
Expected Output:
```
0 1 2
```
Explanation:
- For `i=0`, `a[0] = 0`, so `p[0] = MEX([]) - 0 = 0`.
- For `i=1`, `a[1] = 1`, so `p[1] = MEX([0]) - 1 = 1`.
- For `i=2`, `a[2] = 0`, so `p[2] = MEX([0, 1]) - 0 = 2`.

The program might output something like:
```
0 1 0
```
which is incorrect because `0` is already used.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the counterexample, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
