The code snippet assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `res[0]` is updated to `mex - ar[0]`.

Since `res[1]` was previously defined as `mex - ar[1]`, this remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[0]` is `mex - ar[0]` and `res[1]` is `mex - ar[1]`, `i` is 0**.
