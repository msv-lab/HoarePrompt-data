Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` and subsequently `mex` is set to `mex - ar[i]`. `i` is decremented by 1. If the current value of `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` remains unchanged and `i` is still decremented by 1.**
