### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array `a` in reverse order and calculating the corresponding values of the permutation `p`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` with length `n`, which will eventually hold the permutation `p`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, representing the current MEX value.

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a` from the last element to the first.
   - For each element `ar[i]` in `a`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p` in `res`, it prints the permutation.

### Issues in the Logic:

- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The logic incorrectly assumes that the MEX can be updated simply by taking the minimum of the current MEX and `mex - ar[i]`. This is flawed because the MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p` being constructed.
- **No Check for Validity**: There is no check to ensure that the constructed `p` is a valid permutation (i.e., all integers from `0` to `n-1` appear exactly once).

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain a set of available numbers (initially `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`) and update it as we construct `p`. For each `a[i]`, we find the smallest available number `mex` and set `p[i] = mex - a[i]`. We then remove `p[i]` from the set of available numbers.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        available = set(range(n))
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = min(available)
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            available.remove(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the original program's logic, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
