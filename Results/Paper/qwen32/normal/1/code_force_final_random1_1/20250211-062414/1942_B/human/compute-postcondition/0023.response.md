The given code snippet initializes the list `res` to a list of `None` values with a length of `n`. This means that the list `res` is now filled with `None` for each of its `n` positions.

Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.**
