The code snippet modifies the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Given that `mex` was initially defined as some value, and `ar[i]` is an element from the list `ar`, the new value of `mex` is the original `mex` minus `ar[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is now `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is now `mex - ar[i]`, `i` remains unchanged.**
