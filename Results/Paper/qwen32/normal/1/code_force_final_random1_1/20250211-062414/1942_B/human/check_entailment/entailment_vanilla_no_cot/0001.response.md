Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` of length `n` from the array `a`, where `a[i] = MEX(p[1], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`. The MEX function returns the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given array.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a result array `res` of size `n` with `None`.
   - It also initializes `mex` to `n`.

2. **Reversal and Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, it prints the result array `res`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The approach of initializing `mex` to `n` and updating it in reverse order does not correctly reflect the definition of MEX.
- The MEX should be calculated dynamically based on the elements already placed in `res` up to the current index.
- The program does not ensure that the values in `res` form a valid permutation (i.e., all integers from `0` to `n-1` appear exactly once).

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Initialize a set to keep track of used numbers.
2. Iterate through the array `a` in forward order.
3. For each `a[i]`, find the smallest non-negative integer `x` such that `x - a[i]` is not yet used.
4. Add `x - a[i]` to the result and mark it as used.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
