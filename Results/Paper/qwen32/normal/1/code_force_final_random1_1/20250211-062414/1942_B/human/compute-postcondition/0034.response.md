To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

This means the loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element
- `res` is a list where `res[1]` is `mex - ar[1]`. If `mex > mex - ar[1]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[1]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged.
- `i` is 1

Since the loop iterates in reverse order, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be decremented by 1, making it `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` remains the same (the input integer)
- `ar` remains the same (a list of integers read from the input with at least one element)
- `res` remains the same (a list where `res[1]` is `mex - ar[1]`)
- `i` is now `0`

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[1]` is `mex - ar[1]`, `i` is 0**
