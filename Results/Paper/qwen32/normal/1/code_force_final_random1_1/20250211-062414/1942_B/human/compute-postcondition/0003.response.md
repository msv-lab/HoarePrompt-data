The code creates a list named `res` with `n` elements, all initialized to `None`. The values of `t` and `ar` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`.**
