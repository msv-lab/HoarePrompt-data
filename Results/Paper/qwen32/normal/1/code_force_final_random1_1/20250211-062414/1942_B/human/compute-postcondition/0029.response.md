Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged.**
