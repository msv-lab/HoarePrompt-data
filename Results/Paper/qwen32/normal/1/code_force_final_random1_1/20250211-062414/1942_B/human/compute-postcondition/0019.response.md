To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This seems to be the number of test cases, but it does not directly affect the current snippet).
   - `n`: An input integer representing the length of the list `ar`.
   - `ar`: A list of integers.
   - `res`: A list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - `mex`: The smallest non-negative integer not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.

2. **Calculation of `mex`:**
   - `mex` is determined such that no value of `mex - ar[i]` (for any `i` from `0` to `n-1`) has been previously encountered in the `res` list.
   - This means `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that, when subtracted from each element in `ar`, results in a unique set of values.

3. **Calculation of `res`:**
   - For each element `ar[i]` in the list `ar`, compute `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
   - Ensure that each `res[i]` is unique by adjusting `mex` accordingly.

4. **Output Statement:**
   - The `print` statement joins all elements of the `res` list into a single string with spaces between them and prints it.

Given this understanding, the output will be a space-separated string of integers where each integer is the result of `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `ar = [1, 2, 0]` and `n = 3`.

1. Initialize `mex` to 0.
2. Compute `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 0 - 1 = -1`. Store `-1` in `res`.
3. Increment `mex` to 1 because `-1` is already used.
4. Compute `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 1 - 2 = -1`. Since `-1` is already used, increment `mex` to 2.
5. Compute `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 2 - 2 = 0`. Store `0` in `res`.
6. Increment `mex` to 3 because `0` is already used.
7. Compute `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 3 - 0 = 3`. Store `3` in `res`.

Thus, `res = [-1, 0, 3]`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1 0 3**

However, since the exact values of `ar` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables and the process described above.

### General Output Description:
Output: **a space-separated string of integers where each integer is the result of `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1` (where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer ensuring all `res[i]` are unique)**
