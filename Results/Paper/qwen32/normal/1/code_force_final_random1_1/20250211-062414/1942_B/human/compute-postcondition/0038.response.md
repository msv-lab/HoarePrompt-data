To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop step-by-step.

The loop iterates over the list `ar` in reverse order (from the last element to the first). For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, it updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`.

Here’s the breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` starts at `n`.
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values with length `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = len(ar) - 1` down to `i = 0`.
   - For each `i`, `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.
   - If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `res` will contain the calculated values for each index `i` based on the initial `mex` and subsequent updates.
   - `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that has not been encountered in the form of `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.

Let's formalize the final state:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `ar` remains unchanged.
- `res` will be filled with values `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`, with `mex` being updated as described.
- `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the form `mex - ar[i]`.

Given these points, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` with `mex` being updated as described, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the form `mex - ar[i]`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `res` will contain the computed differences between the current `mex` and each element of `ar` in reverse order, and `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been "used up" by any of these differences.
