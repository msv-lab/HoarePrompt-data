To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `while n:`. This loop will execute as long as `n` is truthy (i.e., non-zero).

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are input integers
- `L` is an empty list

The loop condition `while n:` implies that the loop will execute if `n` is any non-zero integer.

Since `n` is an input integer, there's no inherent requirement to change `t` or `L` to make the loop execute. The only variable we need to ensure is non-zero is `n`.

Therefore, the state should be modified to ensure that `n` is a non-zero integer. Since `n` is already described as an input integer, we can specify that it should be explicitly non-zero.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is an input integer; `L` is an empty list**
