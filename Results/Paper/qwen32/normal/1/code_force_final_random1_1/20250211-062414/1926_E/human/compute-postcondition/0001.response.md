In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop body.

To ensure that the loop executes, the value of `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` is already defined as being in the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), no adjustment is needed for `t` itself to ensure the loop executes.

The only object in the loop head is the throwaway variable `_`, which does not require any specific state adjustment because it is not used within the loop body.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute, given the constraints on `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4**
