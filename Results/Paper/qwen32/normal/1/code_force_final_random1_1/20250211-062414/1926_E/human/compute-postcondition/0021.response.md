Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is set to 1.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is a list containing a single element `[1]`.
- `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` + `a` (where `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it doesn't affect our calculation directly here).
- `pow` is set to 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables Involved:**
   - `pow`: This is explicitly set to 1.
   - `k`: This is an input integer.
   - `tot`: This is an integer that is less than `k`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Since `pow` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

3. **Value Calculation:**
   - We know `tot < k`, so `k - tot` is a positive integer.
   - Let's denote `k - tot` as `x`, where `x` is a positive integer.
   - The expression then becomes `2 * x - 1`, which is an odd number since `2 * x` is even and subtracting 1 from an even number results in an odd number.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be an odd number that is derived from the formula `2 * (k - tot) - 1`.

Output: **2 * (k - tot) - 1 (where k is the input integer and tot is an integer less than k)**
