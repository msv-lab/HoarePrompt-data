The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Given the initial state, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. Initially, `L` contains one element, which is also `(n + 1) // 2`. After appending `m` to `L`, `L` will now contain two elements, both of which are `(n + 1) // 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `tot`, and `pow`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`, `tot` is 1, `pow` is 2, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
