To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop. The loop condition is `while n:` which means the loop will continue as long as `n` is not zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)
- `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is `input_k`
- `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`
- `tot` is `0`
- `pow` is `1`
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

We need to ensure that `n` is not zero for the loop to execute one more time. Since the only variable in the loop condition is `n`, we need to adjust `n` so that it remains non-zero.

Let's analyze the expression for `n`:
\[ n = n - \left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right) \]

This expression reduces `n` by half of its current value plus half. To ensure that `n` remains non-zero, we need to start with a non-zero `n` and ensure that the new value of `n` after this operation is still non-zero.

If `n` is initially 1, then:
\[ n = 1 - \left(\frac{1 + 1}{2}\right) = 1 - 1 = 0 \]
This would terminate the loop, so `n` should be greater than 1.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` should be adjusted to a value greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`; `tot` is `0`; `pow` is `1`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
