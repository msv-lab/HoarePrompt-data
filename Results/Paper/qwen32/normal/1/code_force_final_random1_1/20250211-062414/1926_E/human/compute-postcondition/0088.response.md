The given code snippet is simply reassigning the value `1` to the variable `pow`. Since `pow` was already initialized to `1`, this operation does not change its value. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is `0`; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is a list containing the sequence of values obtained from `(n + 1) // 2` in each iteration until `n` becomes 0; `tot` is `0`; `pow` is `1`.**
