The code snippet updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input. The initial state specifies that `n` is 0 and `k` is an input integer. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will be assigned the values from the input.

Since the input is read as two integers separated by a space, let's denote these input values as `input_n` and `input_k`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `n` will be `input_n` and `k` will be `input_k`.

The other variables (`t`, `L`, `tot`, and `pow`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is `input_n`; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is the list of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is `(ni + 1) // 2`; `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`; `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\)**.
