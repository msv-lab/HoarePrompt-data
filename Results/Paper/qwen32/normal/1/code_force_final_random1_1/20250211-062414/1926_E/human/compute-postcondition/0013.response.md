The code snippet provided is `m = (n + 1) // 2`. This line reassigns the value of `m` to be `(n + 1) // 2`. However, the initial state already specifies that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, the value of `m` does not change after executing this line of code.

Since there are no changes to the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `L`, and the value of `m` remains the same, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is an input integer; `L` is a list containing two elements `[m, m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
