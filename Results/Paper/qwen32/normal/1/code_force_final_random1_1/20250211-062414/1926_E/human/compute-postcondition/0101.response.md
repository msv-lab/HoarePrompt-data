Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t`: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). This variable is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
- `n`: Set to `0`. This variable is also not used in the print statement.
- `k`: Set to `input_k`. This is an unknown value since `input_k` is not specified.
- `L`: A list containing a single element `[1]`. This list is not used in the print statement.
- `pow`: Set to `4`.
- `tot`: Set to `a`. Here, `a` is an unknown value since it is not specified.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
- `pow` is explicitly set to `4`.
- `k` is `input_k`, which is an unknown value.
- `tot` is `a`, which is also an unknown value.

The expression inside the `print` statement is:
\[ \text{pow} \times (2 \times (\text{k} - \text{tot}) - 1) \]

Substituting the known value of `pow`:
\[ 4 \times (2 \times (\text{k} - \text{tot}) - 1) \]

Since `k` and `tot` (`a`) are unknown, we cannot compute a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `k` and `tot`.

### Final Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression \(4 \times (2 \times (\text{k} - \text{tot}) - 1)\), where `k` is `input_k` and `tot` is `a`.

Output: **4 * (2 * (input_k - a) - 1) (where input_k is the value of k and a is the value of tot)**
