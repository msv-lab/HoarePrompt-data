Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 4, `a` is the next element in the list `L` (denoted as `a_next`), and `tot` is updated to its previous value plus `a_next`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a_next`, the condition holds true; otherwise, no further action is taken.**
