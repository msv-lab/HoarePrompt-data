Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). This doesn't affect the print statement directly.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `s` is initialized to 0.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `d` is set to `n`.
- `h` is set to `n`.
- `p` is set to 1.
- `g` is set to 0.
- `f` is set to `k - g`, which simplifies to `k` because `g` is 0.
- `y` is set to 2 since `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(2 * k - 1)
```

This statement involves the variable `k`, which is one of the inputs to the program. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified in the initial state, we can only express the output in terms of `k`.

### Calculation:
- The expression `2 * k - 1` multiplies `k` by 2 and then subtracts 1.

### Final Output:
Given that `k` is an input integer, the output of the print statement will be `2 * k - 1`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
