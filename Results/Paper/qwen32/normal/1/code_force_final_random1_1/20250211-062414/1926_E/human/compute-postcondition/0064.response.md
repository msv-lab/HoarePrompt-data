The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `pow` by 2. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `a`, `tot`) are affected by this operation.

Given that `pow` was initially 2, after executing `pow *= 2`, `pow` will be 4.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 4, `a` is the next element in the list `L`, and `tot` is updated to its previous value plus `a` again.**
