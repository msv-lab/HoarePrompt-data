Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is at least 1.
- `L` is a list with at least one element.
- `pow` is 2.
- `a` is the next element in the list `L`.
- `tot` is `tot + a`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `t`: Given as an input integer within a specific range, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `n`: Explicitly set to 0.
   - `k`: At least 1, so it could be 1 or any positive integer greater than 1.
   - `L`: A list with at least one element. Let's denote the first element of `L` as `a`.
   - `pow`: Explicitly set to 2.
   - `a`: The first element of the list `L`.
   - `tot`: Initially not defined, but it is updated to `tot + a`. Since `tot` is not initialized before this operation, we assume it starts at 0. Therefore, `tot` becomes `a`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
   ```
   - `pow` is 2.
   - `tot` is `a` (the first element of the list `L`).
   - `k` is at least 1.

   Substituting these into the expression:
   - The expression inside the parentheses is `2 * (k - a) - 1`.
   - Multiplying this result by `pow` (which is 2):
     \[
     \text{Output} = 2 \times (2 \times (k - a) - 1)
     \]

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `2 * (2 * (k - a) - 1)`, where `k` is at least 1, `a` is the first element of the list `L`.

Output: **2 * (2 * (k - a) - 1) (where k is at least 1 and a is the first element of the list L)**
