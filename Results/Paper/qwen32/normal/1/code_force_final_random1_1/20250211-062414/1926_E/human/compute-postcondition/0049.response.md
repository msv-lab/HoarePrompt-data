The value of `n` is decremented by `m`, which is `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`, `tot` is 1, `pow` is 2, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
