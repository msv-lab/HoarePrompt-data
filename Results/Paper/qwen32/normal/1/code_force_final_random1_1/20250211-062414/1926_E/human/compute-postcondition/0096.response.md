Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is `0`.
- `k` is `input_k` (we don't have a specific value for `input_k`, so it remains as `k`).
- `L` is `[1]`.
- `pow` is `2`.
- `tot` is `tot + a` (we don't have specific values for `tot` or `a`, so `tot` remains as `tot + a`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
- `pow` is explicitly given as `2`.
- `k` is `input_k`, which means it's a value that is input but not specified here.
- `tot` is described as `tot + a`, but without knowing the initial value of `tot` and the value of `a`, we can only keep it as `tot + a`.

So, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. Calculate `k - tot`: Since `tot` is `tot + a`, this becomes `k - (tot + a)`.
2. Multiply by 2: This results in `2 * (k - (tot + a))`.
3. Subtract 1: This gives `2 * (k - (tot + a)) - 1`.
4. Multiply by `pow` (which is `2`): This results in `2 * (2 * (k - (tot + a)) - 1)`.

### Final Expression:
The expression inside the `print` statement simplifies to:
\[ 2 * (2 * (k - (tot + a)) - 1) \]

### Output Description:
Given the above analysis, the output will be the result of the expression `2 * (2 * (k - (tot + a)) - 1)`.

Output: **2 * (2 * (k - (tot + a)) - 1) (where k is the input value, tot is initially 0 plus some value a)**
