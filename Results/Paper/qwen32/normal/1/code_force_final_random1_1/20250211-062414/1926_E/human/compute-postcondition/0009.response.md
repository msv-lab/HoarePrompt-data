The given code snippet reassigns the value of `m` using the expression `(n + 1) // 2`. However, the initial state already specifies that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, meaning the value of `m` does not change through this operation. Therefore, the state remains the same except for the redundancy in the assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is an input integer; `L` is a list containing one element `[m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
