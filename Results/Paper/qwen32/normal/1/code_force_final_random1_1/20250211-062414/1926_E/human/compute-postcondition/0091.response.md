To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is initialized to `0`.
- `k` is set to `input_k` (an unspecified value).
- `L` is initialized to the list `[1]`.
- `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a` (where `a` is also an unspecified value).
- `pow` is initialized to `1`.

### Expression Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. **`pow`**: This variable is explicitly set to `1` in the initial state.
2. **`(k - tot)`**: Since `tot` is less than `k`, this expression represents a positive difference between `k` and `tot`.
3. **`2 * (k - tot)`**: This multiplies the difference `(k - tot)` by `2`.
4. **`2 * (k - tot) - 1`**: This subtracts `1` from the result of `2 * (k - tot)`.
5. **`pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`**: Since `pow` is `1`, this simplifies to just `2 * (k - tot) - 1`.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the `print` statement will output the value of `2 * (k - tot) - 1`.

Since `k` and `tot` are not explicitly defined with specific values in the initial state, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 * (k - tot) - 1 (where k is the value of input_k and tot is a value less than k)**
