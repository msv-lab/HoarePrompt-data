Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is initialized to 0.
- `k` is at least 1.
- `L` is a list with at least one element.
- `pow` is set to 4.
- `a` (or `a_next`) is the next element in the list `L`.
- `tot` is updated to its previous value plus `a_next`.

### Variables Involved in the Print Statement:
- `pow`: This is explicitly given as 4.
- `k`: This is at least 1.
- `tot`: This is initially 0 and then updated to `tot + a_next` where `a_next` is the next element in the list `L`.

### Expression Analysis:
The expression inside the `print` statement is:
\[ \text{pow} \times (2 \times (\text{k} - \text{tot}) - 1) \]

Let's substitute the known values into this expression:
\[ 4 \times (2 \times (\text{k} - \text{tot}) - 1) \]

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initial Value of `tot`**: Initially, `tot` is 0.
2. **First Update of `tot`**: After the first iteration, `tot` becomes `0 + a_next`, where `a_next` is the first element of the list `L`.
3. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - Let's denote the first element of `L` as `a_1`.
   - After the first update, `tot = a_1`.
   - Substitute `tot = a_1` into the expression:
     \[ 4 \times (2 \times (\text{k} - a_1) - 1) \]

### Final Output:
The output of the print statement depends on the value of `k` and the first element of the list `L` (denoted as `a_1`). Since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only express the output in terms of `k` and `a_1`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **4 * (2 * (k - a_1) - 1) (where k is at least 1 and a_1 is the first element of the list L)**
