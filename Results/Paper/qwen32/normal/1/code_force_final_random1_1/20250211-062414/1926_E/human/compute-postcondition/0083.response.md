The code snippet `m = (n + 1) // 2` reassigns the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. However, the initial state already defines `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, so the value of `m` does not change after the code is executed.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State with respect to the variables mentioned.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`; `tot` is `0`; `pow` is `1`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
