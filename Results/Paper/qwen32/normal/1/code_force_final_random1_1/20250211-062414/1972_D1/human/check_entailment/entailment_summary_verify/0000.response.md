### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not solve the given problem accurately. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - The code includes several utility functions (`func_1` through `func_16`) that handle input/output operations.
   - `func_15` is the primary function that attempts to solve the problem, but it does not correctly implement the logic required to count the valid pairs.
   - The logic in `func_15` involves a loop and some arithmetic operations that do not correspond to checking the condition \( (a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0 \).

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, one must iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given constraints and check if the condition holds.
   - The corrected version of the function, as provided in the original assessment, correctly implements this logic by iterating over all pairs and using the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.

4. **Verification**:
   - The corrected version of the function has been verified to produce the correct output for the provided examples.
   - The original code, particularly `func_15`, does not perform these necessary checks and thus fails to solve the problem correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

Final: **False**
