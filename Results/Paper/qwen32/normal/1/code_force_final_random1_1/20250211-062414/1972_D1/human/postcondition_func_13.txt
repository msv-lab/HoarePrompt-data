The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, and three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It adjusts `k` by subtracting the difference between `m` and each element in `a` that is less than `m`, up to the first `n` elements of `a`. If the adjusted `k` is non-negative, it returns `1`; otherwise, it returns `-1`.
