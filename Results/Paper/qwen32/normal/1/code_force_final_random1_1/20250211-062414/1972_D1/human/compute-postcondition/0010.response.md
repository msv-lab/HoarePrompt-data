Let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables.

Initial State: 
- `n` must be at least 6
- `i` is 3
- `m` is the value returned by `func_7()`
- `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4`

Code Snippet:
```python
ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
```

Impact:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` to it.

Calculations:
- Given `i` is 3, the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` becomes `(n + 3) // (3 * 3)` which simplifies to `(n + 3) // 9`.
- Since `n` must be at least 6, let's consider the minimum value of `n` which is 6.
  - When `n` is 6, `(6 + 3) // 9` evaluates to `9 // 9` which is `1`.
  - Therefore, `ans` will be updated from its initial value to `ans + 1`.

Final Output State:
- `n` must be at least 6 (precondition still holds).
- `i` is 3 (unchanged).
- `m` is the value returned by `func_7()` (unchanged).
- `ans` is now `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 6; `i` is 3; `m` is the value returned by `func_7()`; `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`.**
