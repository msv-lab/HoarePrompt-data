d, processing, da, and rank are not directly related to the problem's input variables n and m as described. However, based on the problem description, the input consists of multiple test cases where each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). The function definition provided does not match the problem description, but assuming the function is meant to process the test cases, the precondition for the input variables within each test case is that n and m are positive integers within the specified range.
