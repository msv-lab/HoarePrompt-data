Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer, and the value returned by `func_15()` has been written to standard output followed by a newline character.**

Explanation: The code writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the requirement that `func_10()` returns a positive integer is still valid.
