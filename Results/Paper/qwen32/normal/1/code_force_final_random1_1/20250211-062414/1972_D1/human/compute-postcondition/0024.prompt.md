You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is an integer key present in the dictionary d, and rank is a list of integers.
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is an integer key present in the dictionary d, and rank is a list of integers; tmp is 1000000000. The length of the list associated with the key `da` in the dictionary `d` is greater than 1.
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: `d` remains unchanged, `processing` remains unchanged, `da` remains unchanged, `rank` remains unchanged, `tmp` holds the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all valid iterations.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` holds the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all valid iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d` (a dictionary with integer keys and list of integers as values), `processing` (a list of integers), `da` (an integer key present in the dictionary `d`), and `rank` (a list of integers). The function returns 1 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all valid iterations.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` holds the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all valid iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
