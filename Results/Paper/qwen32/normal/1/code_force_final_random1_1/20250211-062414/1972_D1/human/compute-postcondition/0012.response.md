To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the termination condition of the loop and how the variables `i` and `ans` evolve during each iteration.

### Loop Analysis
- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`.
- **Initialization**: 
  - `i = 1`
  - `ans = 0`
- **Loop Body**:
  - `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)`
  - `i += 1`

### Iteration Details
- **First Iteration** (`i = 1`):
  - `ans += (n + 1) // 1`
  - `i = 2`
- **Second Iteration** (`i = 2`):
  - `ans += (n + 2) // 4`
  - `i = 3`
- **Third Iteration** (`i = 3`):
  - `ans += (n + 3) // 9`
  - `i = 4`

### General Pattern
Each iteration adds a term `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans` and increments `i` by 1. The loop terminates when `i * i > n + i`.

### Final Output State
The loop will continue until `i * i > n + i`. At that point, `i` will be the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`. The final value of `ans` will be the sum of all terms `(n + k) // (k * k)` for `k` from 1 to `i-1`.

### Conclusion
The final state of the variables after the loop completes is:
- `i` will be the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`.
- `ans` will be the accumulated sum of `(n + k) // (k * k)` for all `k` from 1 to `i-1`.

Given the constraints and the pattern observed, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`; `ans` is the sum of `(n + k) // (k * k)` for all `k` from 1 to `i-1`; `m` remains unchanged as the value returned by `func_7()`.**

In simpler terms, the loop calculates a cumulative sum based on the formula `(n + k) // (k * k)` for each valid `k` and stops when `i * i` exceeds `n + i`. The variable `m` remains unaffected by the loop.
