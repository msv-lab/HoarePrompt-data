### Reasoning

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Mathematical Insight

Given the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\), we can simplify it using \(\gcd(a, b) = d\):
\[a = dx, \quad b = dy \quad \text{where} \quad \gcd(x, y) = 1\]
\[dx + dy \equiv 0 \pmod{d^2y} \implies x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{dy}\]

This means \(x + y\) must be a multiple of \(d\). For each pair \((x, y)\) with \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), we need to count how many multiples of \(d\) fit within the bounds of \(a\) and \(b\).

#### Code Analysis

The code provided includes several utility functions for reading input and a few other functions that do not seem directly related to solving the problem. The core function for solving the problem is `func_15`.

##### Function `func_15`

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This function calculates a sum based on the formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{\sqrt{n+i}} \left\lfloor \frac{n+i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\). However, this formula does not directly correspond to counting the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem's requirements.

The function `func_15` appears to be calculating something related to divisors and sums but does not implement the logic derived from the mathematical insight above.

#### Annotations Review

The annotations describe the purpose and behavior of each function, but they do not provide any specific validation that `func_15` correctly implements the solution to the problem. Instead, they describe the input/output behavior and the general purpose of each function.

#### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. The function `func_15` does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the problem's conditions.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
