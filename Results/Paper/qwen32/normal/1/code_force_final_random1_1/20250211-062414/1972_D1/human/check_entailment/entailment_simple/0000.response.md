### Reasoning:

The given annotated program is intended to solve a specific problem involving counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy certain conditions based on the inputs \(n\) and \(m\). Let's break down the provided code and analyze whether it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

#### Key Points from the Problem Statement:
1. We need to count pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. The condition \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_7()` reads the pair \((n, m)\) for each test case.
   
2. **Main Logic (`func_15()`):**
   - For each test case, `func_15()` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The loop iterates over possible values of \(i\) such that \(i \times i \leq n + i\).
   - For each \(i\), it increments `ans` by \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i \times i} \right\rfloor\).
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the result from `func_15()` is printed.

#### Issues in the Code:
- The main issue lies in the logic of `func_15()`. The current implementation does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The loop and the calculation inside `func_15()` do not align with the problem's requirements. The current approach seems to be trying to count divisors or some related property, but it does not directly address the condition specified in the problem.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This can be done using nested loops, but due to the constraints (\(n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)), this needs to be optimized.

A more efficient approach involves iterating over possible values of \(\gcd(a, b)\) and then counting valid pairs for each \(\gcd\) value. However, the current implementation does not follow this approach.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the current implementation in `func_15()` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
