To determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **L**: A new list of integers obtained from the input.
2. **t**: A variable named `t` (its value is not specified, but it is mentioned).
3. **m**: Initially `m`, then `m = min(m, L[2])`.
4. **k**: `k = L[2]`.
5. **a_1, a_2, ..., a_n**: A list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9.
6. **M**: A new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in ascending order.
7. **q**: `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`.
8. **N**: 
   - If `n * m == k`, then `N = M[:q]`.
   - If `n * m != k`, then `N = M[:q]` with the last element removed.
9. **w**: The last element of the original `N` if `n * m != k`.
10. **mu**: 
    - If `n * m != k`, then `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`.
11. **cost**: 
    - If `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
    - If `n * m != k`, then `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `m` and `k`**:
   - `k = L[2]` (the third element of the list `L`).
   - `m = min(m, L[2])` (initial `m` value is not provided, so `m` will be the minimum of its initial value and `L[2]`).

2. **Calculate `q`**:
   - `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))` (ceiling of `k` divided by `m`).

3. **Form `N`**:
   - If `n * m == k`, `N = M[:q]` (first `q` elements of `M`).
   - If `n * m != k`, `N = M[:q]` with the last element removed.

4. **Determine `w` and `mu`**:
   - If `n * m != k`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
   - If `n * m != k`, `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`.

5. **Calculate `cost`**:
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If `n * m != k`, then `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Output Description:
The `cost` is calculated based on the conditions described above. Since the exact values of `L`, `M`, `n`, and the initial `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `cost`.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions described above)**
