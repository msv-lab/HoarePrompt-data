Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer; `n` is either 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `m` is either 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is either 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the length of `N`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `M[:q]` excluding the last element `M[q-1]`. If `n * m == k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of `N`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `L` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t`; `m` is `min(m, L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in ascending order; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is a list of integers, which is either `M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, or `M[:q]` with the last element removed if `n * m != k`; `w` is the last element of the original `N` if `n * m != k`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m != k`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
