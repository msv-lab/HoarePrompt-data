The given code snippet updates the variable `cost` to `mu * w`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t`; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(m, L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in ascending order; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is a new list of integers, which is the original `N` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w`.**
