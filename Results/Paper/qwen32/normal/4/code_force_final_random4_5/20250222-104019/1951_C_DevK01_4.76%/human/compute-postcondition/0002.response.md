The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `L`. This means that `L` will now hold the integers that were provided in the input.

The initial state specifies conditions on `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. However, the code snippet does not modify these variables directly. Instead, it introduces a new list `L` based on the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is either 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `m` is either 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is either 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
