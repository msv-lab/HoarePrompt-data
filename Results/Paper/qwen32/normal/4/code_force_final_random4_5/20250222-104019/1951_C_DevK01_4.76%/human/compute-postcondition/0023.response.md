The code snippet provided reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `M`. This overwrites the previous value of `M` that was initially a sorted list of integers. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of `N`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `M[:q]` excluding the last element `M[q-1]`. If `n * m == k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
