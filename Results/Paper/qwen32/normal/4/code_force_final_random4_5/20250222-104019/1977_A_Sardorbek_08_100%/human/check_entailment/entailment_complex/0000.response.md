### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if it's correct.

**Problem Analysis:**
1. We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube.
2. The possible outcomes after `n` moves:
   - If `n < m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `n >= m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because:
     - We can add cubes until we reach `m` cubes, and then use the remaining moves to add and remove cubes in pairs, which doesn't change the number of cubes.

**Code Analysis:**
1. The code reads the number of test cases `a`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
3. It then checks:
   - If `n == m`, it prints "YES". This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can just add one cube per move.
   - If `n < m`, it prints "NO". This is correct because if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, it's impossible to reach `m` cubes.
   - If `n >= m` and `n % 2 == m % 2`, it prints "Yes". This is correct because if the difference `n - m` is even, it's possible to reach `m` cubes by adding `m` cubes and then using the remaining `n - m` moves to add and remove cubes in pairs.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No". This is correct because if `n >= m` and `n % 2 != m % 2`, the difference `n - m` is odd, and it's impossible to reach `m` cubes with an odd number of moves left after adding `m` cubes.

The code logic is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.
