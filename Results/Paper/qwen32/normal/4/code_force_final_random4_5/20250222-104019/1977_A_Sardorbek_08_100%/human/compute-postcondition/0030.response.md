The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i`) and their conditions, but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply outputting the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
