The code snippet `a = int(input())` assigns the value of `input()` converted to an integer to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and `m` are integers within specific ranges, but these variables are not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `a` with a value derived from the input.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is an input integer.**
