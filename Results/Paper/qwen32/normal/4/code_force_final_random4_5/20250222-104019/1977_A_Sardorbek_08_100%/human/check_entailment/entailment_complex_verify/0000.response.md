Let's analyze the provided code and the original assessment systematically using the annotated code and the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- **Move Types**: Add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
- **Key Insight**: The difference `|n - m|` must be even, as each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and an even number of such changes is required to go from 0 to `m` if `m` is different from `n`.

### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Annotations:
- **State**: The program reads `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It checks conditions based on the values of `n` and `m` and prints "YES", "NO", "Yes", or "No" accordingly.

### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness**: **False**
- **Reasoning**: The condition `elif b < c:` is incorrect because it should not print "NO" in all cases. Instead, it should check if the parity condition is satisfied.

### Evaluation:
1. **Condition `if b == c:`**: This is correct. If the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
2. **Condition `elif b < c:`**: This is incorrect. The code should not print "NO" if `b < c`. Instead, it should check if the parity of `b` and `c` is the same.
3. **Condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`**: This is correct. If `b` and `c` have the same parity, it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
4. **Condition `else:`**: This handles all other cases, which is correct.

### Counterexample:
- **Input**: `4 2`
- **Expected Output**: `YES`
- **Explanation**: Nikita can perform the following sequence of moves: add, add, remove, remove. This results in a tower with 2 cubes after 4 moves.
- **Actual Output**: The provided code will output "NO" because it does not check the parity condition when `b < c`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided code incorrectly handles the case where `b < c` by printing "NO" without checking the parity condition. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

**Final: False**
