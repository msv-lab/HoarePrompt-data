Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Operations**:
   - Add 1 cube to the tower.
   - Remove 1 cube from the tower (if the tower is not empty).
3. **Objective**: After `n` moves, determine if the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Conditions:
- **Adding and Removing Cubes**:
  - If `n` is equal to `m`, it is possible to add `m` cubes one by one.
  - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes you can add is `n`.
  - If `n` is greater than `m`, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each time you add a cube, you can remove it later, effectively making two moves (one addition and one removal) to cancel each other out. Thus, to end up with `m` cubes, the extra moves (`n - m`) must be even to balance out by adding and removing pairs.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks the following conditions:
1. If `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes), it prints "YES".
2. If `b` is less than `c`, it prints "NO".
3. If `b` is greater than `c` and both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints "Yes".
4. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness Check:
1. **Equality Condition**: This is correct. If `b == c`, then Nikita can add `c` cubes one by one.
2. **Less Than Condition**: This is correct. If `b < c`, it is impossible to have `c` cubes.
3. **Parity Condition**: This is correct. If `b > c` and `b % 2 == c % 2`, it means that `n - m` is even, so it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
4. **Otherwise**: This is also correct. If `b > c` and `b % 2 != c % 2`, it means that `n - m` is odd, so it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described above and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
