Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Let's analyze the provided code and see if it handles all the potential cases as described in the problem statement.

The problem states that in each move, Nikita can either add one cube or remove one cube. Therefore, after `n` moves, the number of cubes `m` on the tower must satisfy the condition that the difference `|n - m|` is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and an even number of such changes is required to go from 0 to `m` if `m` is different from `n`.

Here's the provided code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `if b == c:`: This handles the case where the number of moves equals the number of cubes, which is correct.
2. `elif b < c:`: This handles the case where the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, which is incorrect. Nikita cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves.
3. `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`: This condition checks if the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves and the number of cubes is the same. This is correct because the difference `|n - m|` must be even.
4. `else:`: This handles all other cases, which is correct.

However, the condition `elif b < c:` is incorrect because it should not print 'NO' in all cases. Instead, it should check if the parity condition is satisfied. Let's consider a counterexample:

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
4 2
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
```
Explanation:
Nikita can perform the following sequence of moves: add, add, remove, remove. This results in a tower with 2 cubes after 4 moves.

However, the provided code will output "NO" for this input because `b < c` is not true, and it will not check the parity condition.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
