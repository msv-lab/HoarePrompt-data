Reasoning:
The given problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.

The logic in the program is as follows:
- If `b == c`, it prints "YES" because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
- If `b < c`, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves if each move can only add or remove one cube.
- If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints "Yes" because the difference between `b` and `c` is even, meaning it's possible to reach `c` cubes from `0` cubes by adding/removing cubes in pairs.
- Otherwise, it prints "No" because the difference between `b` and `c` is odd, which cannot be achieved by an even number of moves.

The logic correctly handles all the conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. The execution summary aligns with the logic described in the program.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
