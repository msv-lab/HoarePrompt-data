The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides several conditions and variable definitions, but none of these variables or conditions affect the execution or output of the `print('NO')` statement. The statement is a simple print command that outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, or the conditions involving `b` and `c`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
