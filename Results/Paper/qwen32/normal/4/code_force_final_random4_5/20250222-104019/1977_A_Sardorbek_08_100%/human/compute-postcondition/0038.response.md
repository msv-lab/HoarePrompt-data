Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, the function returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, it returns "n is less than m". If `n` is greater than `m`, it returns "n is greater than m". If `n` is equal to `m`, it returns "n is equal to m".**
