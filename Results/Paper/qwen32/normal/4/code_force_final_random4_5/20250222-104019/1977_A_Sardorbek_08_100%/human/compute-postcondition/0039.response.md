Functionality: **The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. It then prints "YES" if `b` is equal to `c`, "NO" if `b` is less than `c`, and "Yes" if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). Otherwise, it prints "No".**
