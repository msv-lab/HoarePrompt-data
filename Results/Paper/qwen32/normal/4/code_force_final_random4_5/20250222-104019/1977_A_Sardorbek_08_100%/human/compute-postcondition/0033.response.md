The `print('No')` statement in the provided code snippet will output the string `'No'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, or `i`. This is because the `print` function is explicitly given the string `'No'` to print, and this string does not depend on any of the variables in the initial state.

Let's break down the given initial state for clarity:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
- `a` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `b` and `c` are integers provided by the input.
- `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c`.
- If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `c`.
- If `b < c`, `b` is less than `c`.
- If `b` is greater than `c`, and `b % 2 == c % 2`, `b` and `c` have the same parity; otherwise, they have different parities.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

None of these variables or conditions influence the `print('No')` statement. The statement is hardcoded to print `'No'`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **No**
