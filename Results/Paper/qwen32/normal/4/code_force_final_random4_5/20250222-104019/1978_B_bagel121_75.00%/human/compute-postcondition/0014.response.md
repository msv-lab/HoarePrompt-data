Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then the current values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`; and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`; `_` is incremented by 1. `k` is now the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `k` has been updated to be the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
