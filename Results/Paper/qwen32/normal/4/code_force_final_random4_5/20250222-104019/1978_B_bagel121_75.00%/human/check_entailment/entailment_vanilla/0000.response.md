### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the provided program and see if it correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given promotion rules.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b` of the first bun, Bob should not use the promotion because selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield more profit. Thus, the profit is simply `n * a`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, Bob should consider using the promotion. The optimal value of `k` (the number of buns to sell at the modified price) is determined by the formula `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This formula ensures that Bob does not sell more buns at the modified price than the number of buns he has, and also does not sell buns at a price less than the usual price `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`. This sum represents the total revenue from selling the first `k` buns at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` is simply `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two amounts: `ans + p2`.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Since `a < b`, the program calculates `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`. The profit is `((5 + (5 - 2 + 1)) / 2 * 2) + (4 - 2) * 4 = 17`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `a < b`, the program calculates `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`. The profit is `((9 + (9 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5) + (5 - 5) * 5 = 35`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Since `a >= b`, the program correctly returns `n * a = 100`.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `a < b`, the program calculates `k = min(11 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`. The profit is `((11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5) + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45`.

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 10^9`
   - Since `a >= b`, the program correctly returns `n * a = 10^18`.

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 1`
   - Since `a >= b`, the program correctly returns `n * a = 10^18`.

7. **Seventh Test Case:**
   - `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
   - Since `a < b`, the program calculates `k = min(1000 - 1 + 1, 1000) = 1000`. The profit is `((1000 + (1000 - 1000 + 1)) / 2 * 1000) + (1000 - 1000) * 1 = 500500`.

The program correctly handles all the test cases provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain for each test case. 

**Correctness: True**
