Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
Bob wants to maximize his profit from selling `n` buns. The first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price of `a` coins each. We need to find the maximum possible profit.

### Key Observations:
1. If `a >= b`, selling all buns at the usual price `a` will always yield the maximum profit because the modified price will not be higher.
2. If `a < b`, we need to determine the optimal `k` to maximize profit. The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and ending at `b-k+1`. The remaining `n-k` buns are sold at `a`.
3. The sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: \(\text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program correctly implements the above logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- If `a >= b`, it calculates the profit as `n * a`.
- If `a < b`, it calculates the optimal `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
- It then calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the arithmetic series sum formula and adds the profit from the remaining `n-k` buns sold at `a`.
- Finally, it prints the total profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy to maximize the profit. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
