Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then the current values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`; and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`. In both cases, `_` is incremented by 1.**
