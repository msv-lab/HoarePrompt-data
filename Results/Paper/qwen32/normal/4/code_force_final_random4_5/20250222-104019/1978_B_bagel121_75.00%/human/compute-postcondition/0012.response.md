The code snippet provided reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input and assigns them to the respective variables. The initial state mentions several conditions and calculations that depend on these variables, but the given code only updates `n`, `a`, and `b` with the input values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then the current values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`; and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`; `_` is incremented by 1**

In simpler terms, the Output State is: `t` remains the same input integer, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values read from the input. The other variables (`k`, `ans`, `p2`, and `_`) remain as described in the initial state, with their calculations depending on the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
