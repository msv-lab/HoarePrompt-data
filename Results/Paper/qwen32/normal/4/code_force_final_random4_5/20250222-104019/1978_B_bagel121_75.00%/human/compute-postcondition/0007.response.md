The code calculates the variable `ans` based on the given formula. To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression for `ans`:

Given:
- `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.

First, let's break down the expression inside the `int` function:
- `b + (b - k + 1)` simplifies to `2b - k + 1`.
- The entire expression then becomes `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`.

The value of `ans` will be the integer part of the result of this expression.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`**.
