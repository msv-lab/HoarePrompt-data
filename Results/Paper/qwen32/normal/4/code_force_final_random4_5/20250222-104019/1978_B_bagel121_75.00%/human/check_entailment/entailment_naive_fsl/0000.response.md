Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns, considering the promotion rules. Here is the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
```

### Key Points to Verify

1. **When \( a \geq b \)**:
   - The program correctly calculates the profit as \( n \times a \) because selling all buns at the usual price is more profitable.
   
2. **When \( a < b \)**:
   - The program calculates the optimal \( k \) as \( \min(b - a + 1, n) \).
   - It then calculates the profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - The profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns is calculated as \( (n - k) \times a \).
   - Finally, it prints the total profit.

### Correctness Verification
