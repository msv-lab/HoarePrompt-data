To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the calculations step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`.
- `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
- `_` is incremented by 1 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for our purpose).

### Calculations:
1. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - This means `k` is the smaller value between the number of integers from `a` to `b` inclusive and `n`.

2. **Calculate `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated using the formula `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`.
   - This formula involves integer division, so the result is truncated towards zero.

3. **Calculate `p2`:**
   - `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - This represents the product of the difference between `n` and `k`, and `a`.

4. **Sum `ans` and `p2`:**
   - The final output is the result of `ans + p2`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the sum of `ans` and `p2`. Given the calculations, we can describe the output in terms of the input variables `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Let's summarize the output in the required format:

Output: **ans + p2 (where ans is int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k) and p2 is (n - k) * a, with k being the minimum of b - a + 1 and n)**
