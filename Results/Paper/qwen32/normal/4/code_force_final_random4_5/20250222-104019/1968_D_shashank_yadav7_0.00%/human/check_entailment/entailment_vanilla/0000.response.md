Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Permutation and Array**: We are given a permutation `p` and an array `a` of the same length `n`.
2. **Players and Moves**: Two players, Bodya and Sasha, start at positions `P_B` and `P_S` respectively. Each turn, each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation `p`.
3. **Scoring**: The score of each player increases by the value of `a` at their current position at the start of each turn.
4. **Objective**: Determine the winner after `k` turns based on the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.

### Key Points:
- **Moves**: Players can either stay or move to `p_x`. However, the problem does not specify strategy; it assumes both players are trying to win.
- **Scoring Calculation**: The score is simply the sum of the values of `a` at the positions they visit over `k` turns.

### Code Analysis:
The code attempts to simulate the game for each testcase:
1. **Initialization**: Reads input values, converts positions to 0-based indexing, and initializes scores for Bodya and Sasha.
2. **Simulation Loop**: For `k` turns, it updates the positions and scores for both players:
   - It decrements `k` after each turn.
   - Updates positions based on the permutation `p`.
   - Updates scores based on the array `a`.
3. **Comparison**: After `k` turns, it compares the scores and prints the result.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Scoring Update**:
   - `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are incorrect. These lines are trying to update the scores based on some maximum value, which is not required. The correct update should simply be `bm += a[b]` and `sm += a[s]`.
   - `bp` and `sp` are incorrectly used and do not serve any purpose in the current logic.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `n` iterations, but it should run for `k` iterations.
3. **Position Update**: The positions `b` and `s` are updated to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is correct since the permutation is 1-based but Python uses 0-based indexing.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bm = a[b]
        sm = a[s]
        for _ in range(k - 1):  # k - 1 because we already counted the first turn
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original code does not correctly implement the scoring logic and has unnecessary and incorrect parts. The corrected code above should work as expected.

**Correctness: False**
