Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `k` has been decremented by 1, so it is now the second integer from the input minus 2. The values of `bm` and `sm` are recalculated based on the new value of `k` as `a[b] * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * (k + 1)` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
