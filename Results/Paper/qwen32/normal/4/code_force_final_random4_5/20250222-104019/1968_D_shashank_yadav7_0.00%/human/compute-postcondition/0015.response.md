Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the if condition was met, otherwise `k` retains its original value, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `bp * (k - 1)`, `sm` is `sp * (k - 1)`. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
