The code snippet provided increments the variable `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is -1
- `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `sp` is `2 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `2 * a[b] - 1`
- `sm` is `2 * a[s]`
- `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + bm`

The code modifies `sp` as follows:
- `sp += a[s]` means `sp` is now `2 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[s]`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b] - 1`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + bm`**.
