The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Therefore, the new value of `bp` is the sum of its previous value and `a[b]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than `i`
- `k` is -1
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `sp` is `3 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `2 * a[b]`
- `sm` is `a[s]`
- `bm` is `max(bm, bp - a[b])`
- `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

After executing `bp += a[b]`, the value of `bp` changes to `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[b]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, bp - a[b])`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
