Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding

The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation array. On each turn, both players:
1. Increase their score by the value at their current position in the array `a`.
2. Optionally move to the position indicated by the current position in the permutation array `p`.

After `k` turns, the player with the higher score wins. If the scores are equal, the game is a draw.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the input for multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads `n`, `k`, `b` (Bodya's starting position), and `s` (Sasha's starting position).
2. Reads the permutation array `p`.
3. Reads the score array `a`.
4. Initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha.
5. Simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores accordingly.
6. Compares the final scores and prints the winner.

Let's examine the logic in more detail:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions are adjusted to be zero-indexed.
   - Initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to the value at their starting positions in `a`.
   - `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `bp * k` and `sp * k` respectively, which seems incorrect for the simulation logic. These variables should be initialized to `bp` and `sp`.

2. **Simulation Loop**:
   - The loop runs for `k` turns. However, the loop logic is flawed:
     - `k -= 1` decreases `k` before the loop body executes, so the loop will execute `k-1` times.
     - Inside the loop, `b` and `s` are updated to their next positions in the permutation array.
     - The score updates (`bm` and `sm`) are incorrect. The line `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` does not correctly simulate the game. It should simply add `a[b]` to `bm` and `a[s]` to `sm` for each turn.
     - The lines `sp += a[s]` and `bp += a[b]` are unnecessary since the scores are already updated in the previous step.

3. **Comparison**:
   - After the loop, the program correctly compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect due to the flawed initialization and simulation logic. Specifically:
- The initializations of `bm` and `sm` should be `bp` and `sp` instead of `bp * k` and `sp * k`.
- The loop should execute `k` times, not `k-1` times.
- The score updates inside the loop are incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
