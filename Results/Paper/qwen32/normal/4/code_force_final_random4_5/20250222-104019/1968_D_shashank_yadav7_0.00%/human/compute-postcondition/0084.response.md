The code snippet provided only modifies the variable `k`. Since `k` is initially set to `-1`, decrementing it by 1 will result in `k` being `-2`.

All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `sm`, `bm`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b] - 1`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + bm`**.
