Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b] - 1`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, and `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + bm`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.**
