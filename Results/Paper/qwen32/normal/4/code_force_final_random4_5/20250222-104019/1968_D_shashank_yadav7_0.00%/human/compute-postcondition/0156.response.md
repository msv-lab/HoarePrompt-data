Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it calculates scores for two entities, Bodya and Sasha, based on the given rules and prints the name of the entity with the higher score, or "Draw" if the scores are equal.**
