The value of `s` is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
