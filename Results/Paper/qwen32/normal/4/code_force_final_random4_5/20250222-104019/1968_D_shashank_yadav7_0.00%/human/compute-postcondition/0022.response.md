The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1 and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0 if the if condition was met, otherwise `k` retains its original value, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is `p[original_b] - 1` where `original_b` is the initial value of `b`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`**
