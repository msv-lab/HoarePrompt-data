Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists: `p` (a permutation of `n` integers) and `a` (an array of `n` integers). The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
