The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `sm`, and `bm` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b] - 1`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + bm` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
