The code snippet `sp += a[s]` modifies the variable `sp` by adding the value of `a[s]` to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `sp` is `a[s]`
- `bp` is `a[b] - 1`
- `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1) + max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`
- `bm` is `a[b] + max(a[b], bp)`

After executing `sp += a[s]`, `sp` will be `a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] - 1`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1) + max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `bm` is `a[b] + max(a[b], bp)`**.
