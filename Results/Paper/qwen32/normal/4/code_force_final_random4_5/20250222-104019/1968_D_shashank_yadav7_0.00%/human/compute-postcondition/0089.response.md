The code snippet `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` updates the value of `bm` based on the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `k` is -2
- `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `sp` is `3 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `3 * a[b] - 1`
- `sm` is `2 * a[s]`
- `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + bm`

The expression `a[b] * k + bp` can be simplified using the given values:
- `k` is -2
- `bp` is `3 * a[b] - 1`

Thus, `a[b] * k + bp` becomes `a[b] * (-2) + (3 * a[b] - 1)`, which simplifies to `-2 * a[b] + 3 * a[b] - 1`, which further simplifies to `a[b] - 1`.

Now, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] - 1)`.

The new value of `bm` will be:
- If `bm` is greater than or equal to `a[b] - 1`, then `bm` remains `bm + bm` which is `2 * bm`.
- If `a[b] - 1` is greater than `bm`, then `bm` becomes `bm + (a[b] - 1)`.

However, since the initial value of `bm` already includes the term `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, the final expression simplifies to `bm = 2 * bm` if `bm` was already greater than `a[b] - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b] - 1`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, `bm` is `2 * bm`**.
