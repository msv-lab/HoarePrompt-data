The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than `i`, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s]`, `bm` is `a[b]`, and `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
