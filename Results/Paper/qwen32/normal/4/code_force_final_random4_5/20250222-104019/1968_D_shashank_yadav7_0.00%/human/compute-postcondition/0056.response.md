Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` accumulates the values from the list `a` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0, `bp` accumulates the values from the list `a` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0, `bm` accumulates the maximum values based on the current `bp` and `sp` along with the values from the list `a` and the current value of `k` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0, `sm` accumulates the maximum values based on the current `bp` and `sp` along with the values from the list `a` and the current value of `k` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.**

In simple terms, the value of `b` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
