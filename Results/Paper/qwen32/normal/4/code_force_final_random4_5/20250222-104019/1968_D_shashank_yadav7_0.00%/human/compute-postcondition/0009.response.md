The code snippet calculates the value of `bm` by multiplying the value of `a[b]` (which is `bp`) with `k`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s-1`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `bp * k`.**
