The code snippet provided updates the value of `sm` based on the current values of `sm`, `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`. Here's the impact of the code on the variables:

- `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `a[s] * k + sp`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s-1`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`) remain unchanged.

Given that `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, the expression `a[s] * k + sp` can be rewritten as `a[s] * k + 2 * a[s]`, which simplifies to `a[s] * (k + 2)`.

So, the new value of `sm` will be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * (k + 2)`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 1`, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is `p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * (k + 2))`, `s` is `p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
