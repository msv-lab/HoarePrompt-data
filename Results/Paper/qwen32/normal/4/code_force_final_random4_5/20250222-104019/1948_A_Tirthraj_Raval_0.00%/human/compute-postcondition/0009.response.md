The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `i % 2` will be 0, and thus 'A' will be appended to the `pattern` list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer within the range 1 to 50, `n` is an even integer and must be at least 2, `pattern` is ['A'], `i` is 0**.
