The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a throwaway variable), and `t` is the variable that determines how many times the loop will execute. Since `_` does not need to be initialized or adjusted before the loop starts, the only variable we need to consider is `t`.

Given that `t` is already described as an input integer within the range 1 to 50, it is already in a state that ensures the loop will execute at least once, up to 50 times. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is the input integer within the range 1 to 50**
