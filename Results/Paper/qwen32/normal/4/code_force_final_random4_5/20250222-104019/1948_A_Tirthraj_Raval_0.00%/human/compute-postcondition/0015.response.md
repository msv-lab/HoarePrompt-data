The code appends an element to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Given `i` is 2, `i % 2` equals 0, so the character at index 0 of the string 'AB' is appended to `pattern`. This character is 'A'.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer within the range 1 to 50, `n` is an even integer and must be at least 2, `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'A'], `i` is 2**.
