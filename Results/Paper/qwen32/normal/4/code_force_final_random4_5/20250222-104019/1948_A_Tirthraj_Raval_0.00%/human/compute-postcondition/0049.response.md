The code appends an element to the list `pattern` based on the value of `i % 2`. Given `i` is 3, `i % 2` equals 1. Therefore, the element at index 1 of the string 'AB' is appended to `pattern`. The string 'AB' has 'A' at index 0 and 'B' at index 1, so 'B' is appended to `pattern`. 

The initial state specified that `pattern` contains four elements with the last element being 'B'. After appending 'B', `pattern` will have five elements, with the last two elements being 'B'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 to 48, `n` must be at least 7, `pattern` is a list containing five elements where the last two elements are 'B', `i` is 3**.
