Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case when `n` is odd. According to the problem statement, a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program incorrectly assumes that `n` must be even to construct such a string, which is not true. There can be valid strings with an odd number of special characters.

For example, the string "MM" has 1 special character, which is an odd number. Therefore, when `n` is 1, the output should be "YES\nM", not "NO".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            # Construct a pattern with n special characters
            # Start with 'A'
            pattern = ['A']
            for i in range(1, n):
                if i % 2 == 1:
                    pattern.append('A')
                else:
                    pattern.append('B')
            # Add one more character to close the pattern if needed
            pattern.append('A')
            print(''.join(pattern))

# Example usage
# func()
```

This version of the program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and constructs a valid string with the required number of special characters.
