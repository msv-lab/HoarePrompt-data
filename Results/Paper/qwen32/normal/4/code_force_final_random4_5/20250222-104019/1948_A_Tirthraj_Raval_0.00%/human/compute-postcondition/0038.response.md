The code snippet provided only assigns an input value to the variable `n`. It does not affect the variable `t` or the `pattern` list since the list creation logic is contingent on the value of `n` after the input, which is not yet determined. Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the `pattern` list is not yet defined based on the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 to 48, `n` is an input integer.**
