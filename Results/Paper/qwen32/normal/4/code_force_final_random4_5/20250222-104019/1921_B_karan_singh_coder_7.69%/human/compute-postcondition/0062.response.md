Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two strings `s` and `f`, each of length `n` (where `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5) consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
