The code snippet provided resets the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `s1`, `t1`, or `d` (if `d` was previously defined). The only change is that `cnt` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`, and `cnt` is 0. If the count of '1's in the new `s` is equal to the count of '1's in `t`, then `s1` is equal to `t1`. Otherwise, `s1` is not equal to `t1` and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
