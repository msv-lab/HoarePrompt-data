Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s and f are strings of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    s1 = s.count('1')
    t1 = t.count('1')
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += s[i] != t[i]
    if s1 == t1:
        print(s1 if cnt else 0)
    else:
        d = abs(s1 - t1)
        print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a string representing the input, n is greater than 0, s is the input string, s1 is the count of '1's in s, t1 is the count of '1's in t, and cnt is the total number of positions where s[i] is not equal to t[i]. If the count of '1's in s is equal to the count of '1's in t, then s1 is equal to t1. Otherwise, s1 is not equal to t1 and d is the absolute difference between s1 and t1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the new input string, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`, and `cnt` is the number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then no additional changes are made. If `s1` is not equal to `t1`, then `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the new input string, `n` is the input integer from the user, `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, and `cnt` is the number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then the count of '1's in `s` is equal to the count of '1's in `t`. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
