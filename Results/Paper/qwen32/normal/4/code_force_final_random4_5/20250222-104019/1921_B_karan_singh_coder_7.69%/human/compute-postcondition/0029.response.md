The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments the variable `cnt` by 1 if the characters at the `i`-th position in the strings `s` and `t` are not the same. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `s1`, and `t1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`, and `cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i] != t[i]`.**
