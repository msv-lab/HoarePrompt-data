The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'-1'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `v`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the values of these variables do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('-1')`.
2. This statement directly prints the string `'-1'` to the output.
3. The variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `v` are mentioned in the initial state but are not referenced in the code snippet.
4. Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables, their values do not influence the output.

Output: **-1**
