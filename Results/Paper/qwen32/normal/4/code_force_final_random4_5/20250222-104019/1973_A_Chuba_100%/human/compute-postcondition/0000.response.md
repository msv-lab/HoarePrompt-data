Output State: **`t` is an input integer, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**

The value of `t` is now an integer input by the user, while the conditions and constraints on `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged.
