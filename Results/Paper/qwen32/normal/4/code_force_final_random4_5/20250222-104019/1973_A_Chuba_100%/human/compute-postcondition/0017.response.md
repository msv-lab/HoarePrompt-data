In the given initial state, the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `v` are described, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'-1'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is set to 1.
2. **Variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`**: These are integers with the constraint 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
3. **Variable `v`**: It is a list of integers obtained from the input.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('-1')
```

Given this statement, the output will be the string `'-1'` regardless of the values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `v`.

Output: **-1**
