The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations. The loop iterates `t` times, so to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
- `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `result` is calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.

Since the loop head does not involve `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, or `v`, and the only variable that can be adjusted is `t`, we only need to adjust `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer and must be equal to 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
