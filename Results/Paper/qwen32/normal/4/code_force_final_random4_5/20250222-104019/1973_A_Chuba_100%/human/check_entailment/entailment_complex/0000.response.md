### Reasoning:
The program's logic is based on the following observations:

1. **Sum of Scores Modulo 2 Check**:
   - The sum of all scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` must be even because each game awards either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points in total (in case of a draw). Hence, if the sum of scores is odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, and the program correctly returns `-1`.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - When the sum of scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula: `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the calculation accounts for the scenario where the highest score `v[2]` is significantly higher than the sum of the other two scores `v[0] + v[1]`. This is necessary because if `v[2]` is too high, it indicates that the player with `v[2]` must have won a lot of games, reducing the possible number of draws.
   - By subtracting this term from the total score sum and dividing by 2, the program effectively calculates the maximum number of draws possible while ensuring that the score distribution remains valid.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1**: `(0, 0, 0)` → Sum is 0 (even). No games were played, so the result is `0` draws.
- **Example 2**: `(0, 1, 1)` → Sum is 2 (even). One draw between the second and third players results in scores `(0, 1, 1)`.
- **Example 3**: `(1, 1, 1)` → Sum is 3 (odd). Impossible to achieve with valid games, so the result is `-1`.
- **Example 4**: `(1, 1, 2)` → Sum is 4 (even). Two draws and one win/loss can result in scores `(1, 1, 2)`.
- **Example 5**: `(3, 3, 3)` → Sum is 9 (odd). Impossible to achieve with valid games, so the result is `-1`.
- **Example 6**: `(3, 4, 5)` → Sum is 12 (even). Six draws can result in scores `(3, 4, 5)`.
- **Example 7**: `(1, 1, 10)` → Sum is 12 (even). Two draws and several wins/losses can result in scores `(1, 1, 10)`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify invalid score distributions based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
