### Reasoning:

The program correctly handles the logic to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Sum of Scores Check:**
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total score if each game results in an even number of points being distributed (either 0+2, 2+0, or 1+1).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum of scores is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3 - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the total points account for all games played, where each draw contributes 1 point to each player, and each win/loss contributes 2 points to the winner.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where no games are played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`), resulting in `0` draws.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are not achievable by any combination of games, resulting in `-1`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1: `0 0 0`**
  - Sum is `0` (even), and no draws are possible: `result = (0 + 0 + 0 - max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) // 2 = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2: `0 1 1`**
  - Sum is `2` (even), and one draw is possible: `result = (0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2 = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3: `1 1 1`**
  - Sum is `3` (odd), so it's impossible: Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4: `1 1 2`**
  - Sum is `4` (even), and two draws are possible: `result = (1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5: `3 3 3`**
  - Sum is `9` (odd), so it's impossible: Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 6: `3 4 5`**
  - Sum is `12` (even), and six draws are possible: `result = (3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2 = 6`
  - Output: `6` (Correct)

- **Test Case 7: `1 1 10`**
  - Sum is `12` (even), and two draws are possible: `result = (1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws and handles all edge cases appropriately.
