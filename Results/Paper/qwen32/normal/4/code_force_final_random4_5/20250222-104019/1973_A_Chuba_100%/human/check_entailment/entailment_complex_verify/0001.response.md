### Reasoning:

The original assessment carefully analyzed the problem, the program logic, and the provided test cases. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's correctness based on the given annotations and examples:

1. **Parity Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is even. If the sum is odd, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to distribute points according to the rules of the game.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3) - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)}{2}
   \]
   - The term `max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)` ensures that we do not subtract a negative number, which would incorrectly increase the number of draws.
   - The formula calculates the maximum number of draws by considering the points that must be attributed to wins and the rest to draws.

3. **Testing with Examples**: The program was tested with multiple examples provided in the problem statement, and the outputs matched the expected results:
   - **Input**: `0 0 0` → **Output**: `0` (correct)
   - **Input**: `0 1 1` → **Output**: `1` (correct)
   - **Input**: `1 1 1` → **Output**: `-1` (correct)
   - **Input**: `1 1 2` → **Output**: `2` (correct)
   - **Input**: `3 3 3` → **Output**: `-1` (correct)
   - **Input**: `3 4 5` → **Output**: `6` (correct)
   - **Input**: `1 1 10` → **Output**: `2` (correct)

4. **Annotations**: The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that the program reads the input correctly, performs the necessary checks, and calculates the result accurately.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all the provided test cases accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
