The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. The loop will execute based on the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` do not affect whether the loop executes, as they are used inside the loop body, not in the loop head.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `t` is at least 1. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain as they are since they do not influence the loop execution.

State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30**
