Let's analyze the given Python program and determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the provided description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total points from all games must be even (since each game awards a total of 2 points: either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser, or 1 to each in case of a draw).

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     ```python
     result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
     ```
   - This formula aims to maximize the number of draws while ensuring that the scores can be achieved by a valid set of games.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) // 2` gives the total number of games played because each game contributes 2 points.
- The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is used to ensure that the highest scoring player `v[2]` can have won at least as many games as the sum of the games won by the other two players `v[0]` and `v[1]`. This is necessary because if `v[2]` has more points than the sum of the points of `v[0]` and `v[1]`, it implies that `v[2]` has won more games than the other two combined, which is not possible unless there are draws.
- Subtracting this term from the total points and dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1:** `0 0 0`
  - Total points: `0` (even)
  - Maximum draws: `0`
- **Example 2:** `0 1 1`
  - Total points: `2` (even)
  - Maximum draws: `1`
- **Example 3:** `1 1 1`
  - Total points: `3` (odd)
  - Result: `-1`
- **Example 4:** `1 1 2`
  - Total points: `4` (even)
  - Maximum draws: `2`
- **Example 5:** `3 3 3`
  - Total points: `9` (odd)
  - Result: `-1`
- **Example 6:** `3 4 5`
  - Total points: `12` (even)
  - Maximum draws: `6`
- **Example 7:** `1 1 10`
  - Total points: `12` (even)
  - Maximum draws: `2`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given problem description and the provided examples. It checks the validity of the input scores and calculates the maximum number of draws accordingly.

**Correctness: True**
