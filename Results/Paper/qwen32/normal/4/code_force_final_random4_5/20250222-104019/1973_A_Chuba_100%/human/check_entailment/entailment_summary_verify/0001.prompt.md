You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted integers representing the scores of three players. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates and outputs a specific result based on the scores.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, with the condition that `p1 <= p2 <= p3`. The total points distributed in each game are either 2 (if one player wins) or 2 (if the game is a draw, with both players getting 1 point each). Therefore, the total points `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even.

### Key Points

1. **Parity Check**: The total points `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even. If the sum is odd, it's impossible to distribute the points according to the problem's rules, and we should return `-1`.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: If the sum of points is even, we need to find the maximum possible number of draws. The formula used in the program is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3) - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)}{2}
   \]
   This formula tries to maximize the number of draws by minimizing the points that must be attributed to wins.

### Program Analysis

The program follows these steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
3. It checks if the total points `p1 + p2 + p3` are even. If not, it prints `-1`.
4. If the total points are even, it calculates the result using the formula provided and prints it.

### Verification

Let's verify the formula used in the program.

- The term `max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)` ensures that we do not subtract a negative number, which would incorrectly increase the number of draws.
- The formula `((p1 + p2 + p3) - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2` calculates the maximum number of draws by considering the points that must be attributed to wins and the rest to draws.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0` (even)
   - Draws: `0`
   - Output: `0` (correct)

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2` (even)
   - Draws: `1`
   - Output: `1` (correct)

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4` (even)
   - Draws: `2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Draws: `6`
   - Output: `6` (correct)

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Draws: `2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify inconsistent scores. Therefore, the program is correct.
