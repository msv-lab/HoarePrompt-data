Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 2 elements; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key, and `frequency_table[num]` is now set to `k`; `num` is the next element in the list `arr` to be processed.**

In this output state, the `frequency_table` dictionary has been updated so that the key `num` now has the value `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
