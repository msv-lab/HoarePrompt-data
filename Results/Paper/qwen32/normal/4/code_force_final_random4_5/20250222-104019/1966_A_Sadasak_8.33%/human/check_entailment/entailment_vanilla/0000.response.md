Let's walk through the logic and identify any issues in the provided program.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to minimize the number of cards in the hand after performing the described operations any number of times. The operations allow us to exchange `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards of any number.

### Key Observations
1. **If a number appears `m` times where `m >= k`, you can reduce the count of that number by `k` and increase it by `k-1` (net reduction of 1).**
2. **The optimal strategy is to reduce the count of the most frequent numbers as much as possible.**

### Steps for Solution
1. **Count the frequency of each number in the hand.**
2. **For each number that appears `m` times where `m >= k`, reduce `m` by `k` repeatedly until `m < k`.**
3. **The remaining count of cards is the minimum possible number of cards.**

### Provided Program Analysis
Let's analyze the provided program step by step:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the list of card numbers.
2. **Special Cases:**
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the answer is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, one operation can be performed, reducing the number of cards by 1.
3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the frequency of each number but with a twist: it caps the frequency at `k`. This is incorrect because we need the actual frequency to determine how many operations can be performed.
4. **Output Logic:**
   - The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values, which is not a correct condition to determine the minimum number of cards. It should calculate the remaining count after performing the maximum possible operations.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Frequency Calculation:** The function `func_1` incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`, which is not needed and leads to incorrect results.
- **Incorrect Output Logic:** The program does not correctly calculate the remaining number of cards after performing the operations.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
