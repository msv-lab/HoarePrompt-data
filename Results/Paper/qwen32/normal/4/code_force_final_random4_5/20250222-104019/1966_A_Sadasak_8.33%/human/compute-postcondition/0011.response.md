The given code snippet increments the count of `num` in the `frequency_table` dictionary by 1. If `num` is not already a key in `frequency_table`, it is added with a value of 1.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
- `n` (the length of `arr`) is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key, and `frequency_table[num]` is `k` if it was originally greater than `k`; otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged.
- `num` is the next element in the list `arr` to be processed.

The code updates `frequency_table[num]` by incrementing its value by 1. If `num` is not in `frequency_table`, it is added with a value of 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 2 elements; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key, and `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1; `num` is the next element in the list `arr` to be processed.**
