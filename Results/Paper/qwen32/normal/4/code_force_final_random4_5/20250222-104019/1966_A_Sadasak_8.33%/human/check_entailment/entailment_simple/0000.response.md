Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing a series of operations where we can exchange any k cards with the same number for k-1 cards with any numbers. The given program attempts to solve this problem by calculating the frequency of each card number and then making a decision based on these frequencies.

However, there are a few issues with the provided program:

1. **Logic Error in the Main Function**:
   - The program checks if `k > n` and prints `n` if true. This logic is not correct because even if `k > n`, we can still perform operations if there are at least `k` cards with the same number.
   - The program checks if `k == n` and prints `k - 1` if true. This is also not correct because if all cards are the same, we can reduce the number of cards to `1` by repeatedly performing the operation.
   - The program calls `func_1` to get the frequency table but then incorrectly checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. This check is not relevant to determining the minimum number of cards left.

2. **Incorrect Use of the Frequency Table**:
   - The `func_1` function creates a frequency table where the value for each key is the minimum of its occurrences in `arr` and `k`. This is not useful for determining the minimum number of cards left because it does not account for the actual reduction of cards through the operations.

3. **Lack of Proper Reduction Logic**:
   - The program does not implement the logic to reduce the number of cards based on the operations described. The correct approach would involve using the frequency of each card number to determine how many operations can be performed and then calculating the minimum number of cards left.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
