You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Function Summary: 
The function takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr` and its value is the minimum of the number's occurrences in `arr` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's walk through the logic and identify any issues in the provided program.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to minimize the number of cards in the hand after performing the described operations any number of times. The operations allow us to exchange `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards of any number.

### Key Observations
1. **If a number appears `m` times where `m >= k`, you can reduce the count of that number by `k` and increase it by `k-1` (net reduction of 1).**
2. **The optimal strategy is to reduce the count of the most frequent numbers as much as possible.**

### Steps for Solution
1. **Count the frequency of each number in the hand.**
2. **For each number that appears `m` times where `m >= k`, reduce `m` by `k` repeatedly until `m < k`.**
3. **The remaining count of cards is the minimum possible number of cards.**

### Provided Program Analysis
Let's analyze the provided program step by step:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the list of card numbers.
2. **Special Cases:**
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the answer is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, one operation can be performed, reducing the number of cards by 1.
3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the frequency of each number but with a twist: it caps the frequency at `k`. This is incorrect because we need the actual frequency to determine how many operations can be performed.
4. **Output Logic:**
   - The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values, which is not a correct condition to determine the minimum number of cards. It should calculate the remaining count after performing the maximum possible operations.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Frequency Calculation:** The function `func_1` incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`, which is not needed and leads to incorrect results.
- **Incorrect Output Logic:** The program does not correctly calculate the remaining number of cards after performing the operations.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
