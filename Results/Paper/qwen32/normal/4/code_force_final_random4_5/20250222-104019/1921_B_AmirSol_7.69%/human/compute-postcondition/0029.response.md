Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for the current `i`, and `i` is less than `n - 2`.**

Natural language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is one more than its previous value. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
