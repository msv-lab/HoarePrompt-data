Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for the current `i`. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, `counter` is incremented by 1. If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 or remains less than `n - 1`. If `s1[i]` equals `s2[i]`, `i` is less than `n - 2`.**
