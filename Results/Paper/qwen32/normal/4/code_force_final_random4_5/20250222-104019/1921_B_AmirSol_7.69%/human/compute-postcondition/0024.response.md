The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for the current `i`, and `i` is less than `n - 1`; `counter` is incremented by 1.**
