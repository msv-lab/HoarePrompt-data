The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, divides it by 2 using integer division, and assigns the result to `x`. The values of `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `y_b`, `b`, `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1; `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are as initially described; `r`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the integers from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`.**
