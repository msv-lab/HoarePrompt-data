To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given code and the initial state step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t`: Input integer, greater than 0.
   - `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`: These are not explicitly defined in the context provided but are assumed to be part of the input.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`: Six integers from the input, with `a <= c`.
   - `x`: Calculated as `(c - a) // 2`.
   - `r`: Calculated as `min(w, d + x)`.
   - `l`: Calculated as `max(1, d - x)`.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition in the print statement is `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
   - This condition checks if `b` is within a certain range defined by `l` and `r` with a tolerance of `x + 1`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The print statement uses a tuple indexing method to choose between `['Draw']` and `['Alice']`.
   - If the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is true, it prints `['Alice']`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `['Draw']`.

4. **Explanation:**
   - The output depends on the values of `l`, `r`, `b`, and `x`.
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `w` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `x`, `r`, and `l`.
   - However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

**Output:**
The print statement will output either `['Draw']` or `['Alice']` based on whether the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is true or false.
Output: **['Draw'] or ['Alice'] (where the output depends on whether abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1 is true or false)**
