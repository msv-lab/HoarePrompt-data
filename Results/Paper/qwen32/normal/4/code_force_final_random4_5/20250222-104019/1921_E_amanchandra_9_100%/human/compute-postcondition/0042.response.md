Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`. Here, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of a rectangle, and `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are distinct positions within this rectangle. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given positions and dimensions.**
