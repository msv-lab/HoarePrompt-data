Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer that was initially greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1. `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as initially described. `r` is `min(w, d + x)` if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, otherwise `r` is `min(w, b + x)`. `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the integers from the input. `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`. `l` is `max(1, d - x)` if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, otherwise `l` is `max(1, b - x)`**
