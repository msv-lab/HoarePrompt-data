The given Python code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state provided does not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference any of the variables `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d` within the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print` statement is `print('Draw')`.
- The string `'Draw'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any variables or conditions derived from the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
