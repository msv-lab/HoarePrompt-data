To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given conditions and the expression inside the `print` statement.

### Given:
- `t` is an input integer that is greater than 0.
- `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are not explicitly defined, but they are part of the initial state.
- `r` is defined as `min(w, b + abs(a - c) // 2)`.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers from the input.
- `x` is defined as `abs(a - c) // 2`.
- `l` is defined as `max(1, b - abs(a - c) // 2)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
```

### Analysis:
The print statement uses a conditional indexing mechanism to choose between two lists: `['Draw']` and `['Bob']`. The index is determined by the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`.

1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x = abs(a - c) // 2`
   
2. **Calculate `l`:**
   - `l = max(1, b - abs(a - c) // 2)`
   
3. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r = min(w, b + abs(a - c) // 2)`

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` needs to be evaluated.

### Output Determination:
- If the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is `True`, the index is `1`, and `['Bob']` is selected.
- If the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is `False`, the index is `0`, and `['Draw']` is selected.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `w`, and `h` are not provided, we cannot definitively determine whether the condition is `True` or `False`. However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

### Conclusion:
The output will be either `['Draw']` or `['Bob']` depending on whether the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is `True` or `False`.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Bob'] based on the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`**
