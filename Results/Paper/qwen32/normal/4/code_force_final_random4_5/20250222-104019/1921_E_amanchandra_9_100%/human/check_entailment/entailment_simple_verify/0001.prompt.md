You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, on a checkered board with specific movement rules. The key points to consider are:
1. **Alice's Moves**: Can move down, down-right, or down-left.
2. **Bob's Moves**: Can move up, up-right, or up-left.
3. **Winning Condition**: A player wins by moving to a cell occupied by the other player.
4. **Draw Condition**: A player cannot make a move (Alice if she is in the last row, Bob if he is in the first row).

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it determines the outcome based on the initial positions of Alice and Bob. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then the details of each test case.
2. **Comparison of Rows (a vs. c)**:
   - If Alice's row (a) is greater than Bob's row (c), the program immediately outputs "Draw". This is because Alice cannot move up, and if she is already below Bob, there's no way she can reach him.
3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - If Alice's row is not greater than Bob's row, the program calculates the vertical distance between Alice and Bob divided by 2 (`x = abs(a - c) // 2`). This `x` represents the maximum number of moves Alice can make vertically towards Bob.
4. **Odd vs. Even Distance**:
   - **Odd Distance**: If the vertical distance is odd, the program calculates the possible horizontal range (`l` to `r`) that Alice can reach in the same number of moves. It then checks if Bob can be within this range. If he can, it outputs "Alice"; otherwise, it outputs "Draw".
   - **Even Distance**: If the vertical distance is even, the program calculates the possible horizontal range (`l` to `r`) that Bob can reach in the same number of moves. It then checks if Alice can be within this range. If she can, it outputs "Bob"; otherwise, it outputs "Draw".

### Correctness Evaluation

The logic in the program seems to be based on the idea that the game can be analyzed based on the vertical distance between Alice and Bob. However, there are some issues in the logic:
1. **Immediate Draw for Alice Below Bob**: This part is correct. If Alice is already below Bob, she cannot move up and thus cannot win.
2. **Distance Calculation and Range Checking**:
   - The calculation of the horizontal range (`l` to `r`) seems correct based on the vertical distance.
   - However, the conditions for determining the winner based on the horizontal range might not be fully accurate. For example, the conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` might not correctly reflect the optimal moves and possible captures for both players.

### Conclusion

The program's logic for determining the winner based on the horizontal range and vertical distance is not fully robust and might not cover all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program might not always produce the correct outcome.
