The variable `x` is assigned the value of `abs(a - c) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that is greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as initially described, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the integers from the input, `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`.**
