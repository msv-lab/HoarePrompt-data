The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` adds the value at index `i` of the list `a` to `ans1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `ans1` will be updated by adding the second element of the list `a` to it (since list indices start at 0).

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0; `x` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[1]`; `ans2` is calculated as described; `i` is 1.**

In simple terms, `ans1` has been increased by the value of the second element in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
