Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t remains the same; n is the first input integer; k is the second input integer; x is the third input integer; a is a sorted list in descending order; ans1 is the sum of all elements in the list a minus the sum of the first x elements of a multiplied by 2; ans2 is the sum of all elements in the list a minus the sum of the first x elements of a multiplied by 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is a sorted list in descending order. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` multiplied by 2 plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged. `ans2` is the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[i]` if `i + x` is not less than `n`; otherwise, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[i] - a[i + x] * 2`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`. `ans2` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `ans2` and the updated `ans1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
