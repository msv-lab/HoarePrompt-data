The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` will subtract twice the value of the element at index `i + x` in the list `a` from `ans1`.

Given that `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, the value of `ans1` will now be adjusted by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` and then decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`.**
