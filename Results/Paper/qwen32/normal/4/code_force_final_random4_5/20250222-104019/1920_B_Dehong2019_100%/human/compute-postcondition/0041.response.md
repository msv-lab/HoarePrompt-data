The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `a[i] * 2` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `x` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus `a[i] * 4` minus `a[i] * 2`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` observed during the iterations, `i` is incremented by 1.**
