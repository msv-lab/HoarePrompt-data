The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `a[i + x] * 2` from its current value. The other variables `k`, `a`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. Since `ans1` was initially incremented by `a[i]`, this new operation adjusts `ans1` by subtracting `a[i + x] * 2`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `ans1` is incremented by `a[i]` and then decremented by `a[i + x] * 2`; `a` and `i` are unchanged; `i + x` is less than `n`.**
