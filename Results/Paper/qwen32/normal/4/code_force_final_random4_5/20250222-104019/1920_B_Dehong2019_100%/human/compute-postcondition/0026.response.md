The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans1` is updated by adding the value of `a[2]` to it.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0; `x` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[2]`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`; `i` is 2**.
