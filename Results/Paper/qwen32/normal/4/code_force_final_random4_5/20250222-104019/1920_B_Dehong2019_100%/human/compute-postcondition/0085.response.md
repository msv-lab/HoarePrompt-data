The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_end + 1`, which means `i` is currently greater than or equal to `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be reset to a value less than `k`.

Given that `i` is `i_end + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we can infer that `i_end` was the last valid index where `i < k`. To start the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1 - 1`, which is `i_end`. However, since we are starting a new iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from the last completed iteration, so `i` should be reset to `i_end + 1 - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `i_end + 1 - 1`, or simply `i_end + 1 - 1`, but since we are starting fresh, it should be `0` if `i_end + 1` was equal to `k`. 

Thus, we reset `i` to `0` and ensure `k` remains the same for the loop to execute again.

State: **`k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `ans2` is the maximum value between `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`**
