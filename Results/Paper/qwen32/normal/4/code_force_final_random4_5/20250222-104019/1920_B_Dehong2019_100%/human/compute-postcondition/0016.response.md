Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, and `x` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the first element of `a`; `ans2` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `i` is 0 and `i + x` is less than `n`**
