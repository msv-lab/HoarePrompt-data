The code snippet provided decrements `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i]`. Given that `ans1` was initially defined as the sum of the list `a` minus twice the value of `a[i]`, after executing `ans1 -= a[i] * 2`, `ans1` will be the sum of the list `a` minus four times the value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from the input where `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus four times the value of `a[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
