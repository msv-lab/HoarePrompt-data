The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution or the program state. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

Given that `n` is greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will execute one more time. Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, its value does not need to be adjusted. The value of `n` will be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration to reflect the loop's progression.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this decrement in `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` is greater than 1, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing one element `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y]`, where `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is divisible by 15, or `extra_screen // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not divisible by 15.**
