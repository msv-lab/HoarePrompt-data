You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, it calculates and returns the number of screens required based on the given values of `x` and `y`. The result for each test case is printed on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. Each 5x3 screen has 15 cells.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and the number of 2x2 icons (`y`).

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - It calculates the total space occupied by 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It calculates the total space occupied by 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - It calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons:
     - If `y` is even, then `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, then `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.
   - This is because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and since each screen has 15 cells, two 2x2 icons can fit on a single screen.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - It calculates the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).

5. **Placing 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), then the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If not, it calculates the extra space needed (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`).
   - It then calculates the number of additional screens required for the 1x1 icons:
     - If `space_x` is exactly divisible by 15, then `extra_screen = space_x // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`.

6. **Result Calculation:**
   - The total number of screens required for each test case is the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`.
   - The results for all test cases are then printed.

### Correctness Check

Let's check the program against the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:** `x = 1`, `y = 1`
  - `space_x = 1`, `space_y = 4`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 - 4 = 11`
  - `space_x <= remaining_cells` is True, so the result is `1`.

- **Test Case 2:** `x = 7`, `y = 2`
  - `space_x = 7`, `space_y = 8`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 - 8 = 7`
  - `space_x > remaining_cells` is True, so `extra_space = 7 - 7 = 0` and `extra_screen = 0`, resulting in `1`.

- **Test Case 3:** `x = 12`, `y = 4`
  - `space_x = 12`, `space_y = 16`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 2`
  - `remaining_cells = 30 - 16 = 14`
  - `space_x > remaining_cells` is True, so `extra_space = 12 - 14 = -2` (but we use `extra_space = 12`), `extra_screen = 1`, resulting in `2 + 1 - 1 = 2`.

- **Test Case 4:** `x = 0`, `y = 3`
  - `space_x = 0`, `space_y = 12`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 2`
  - `remaining_cells = 30 - 12 = 18`
  - `space_x <= remaining_cells` is True, so the result is `2`.

- **Test Case 5:** `x = 1`, `y = 0`
  - `space_x = 1`, `space_y = 0`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 0`
  - `remaining_cells = 0`
  - `space_x > remaining_cells` is True, so `extra_space = 1`, `extra_screen = 1`, resulting in `1`.

- **Test Case 6:** `x = 8`, `y = 1`
  - `space_x = 8`, `space_y = 4`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 - 4 = 11`
  - `space_x <= remaining_cells` is True, so the result is `1`.

- **Test Case 7:** `x = 0`, `y = 0`
  - `space_x = 0`, `space_y = 0`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 0`
  - `remaining_cells = 0`
  - `space_x <= remaining_cells` is True, so the result is `0`.

- **Test Case 8:** `x = 2`, `y = 0`
  - `space_x = 2`, `space_y = 0`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 0`
  - `remaining_cells = 0`
  - `space_x > remaining_cells` is True, so `extra_space = 2`, `extra_screen = 1`, resulting in `1`.

- **Test Case 9:** `x = 15`, `y = 0`
  - `space_x = 15`, `space_y = 0`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 0`
  - `remaining_cells = 0`
  - `space_x <= remaining_cells` is True, so the result is `1`.

- **Test Case 10:** `x = 8`, `y = 2`
  - `space_x = 8`, `space_y = 8`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 - 8 = 7`
  - `space_x > remaining_cells` is True, so `extra_space = 8 - 7 = 1`, `extra_screen = 1`, resulting in `1 + 1 = 2`.

- **Test Case 11:** `x = 0`, `y = 9`
  - `space_x = 0`, `space_y = 36`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 5`
  - `remaining_cells = 75 - 36 = 39`
  - `space_x <= remaining_cells` is True, so the result is `5`.

The program seems to be working correctly for the provided examples. However, there is a logical flaw in the calculation of `extra_screen` when `remaining_cells` is less than `space_x`. The program should correctly handle the case where `remaining_cells` is less than `space_x` by calculating the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion
The program has a logical flaw in the calculation of `extra_screen` and should be corrected to handle the remaining 1x1 icons accurately. However, based on the provided test cases, the program seems to produce the correct output.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True** (assuming the provided test cases are sufficient and the logical flaw is not encountered in the test cases).

However, for a more robust solution, the program should be corrected to handle all edge cases accurately.
