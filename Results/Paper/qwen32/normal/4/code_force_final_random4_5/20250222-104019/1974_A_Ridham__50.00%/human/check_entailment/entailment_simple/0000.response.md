### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for the given test cases.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Space Requirements:**
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is simply `x`.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, representing the total space occupied by the 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculating Screens Required for 2x2 Icons:**
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
   - This is because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. The minimum number of screens required to fit `y` 2x2 icons is calculated based on the fact that each screen can hold at most 3 2x2 icons (since 4 * 3 = 12, and 15 - 12 = 3 cells are left).

4. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, which represents the number of cells left after placing the 2x2 icons on the screens.

5. **Determining Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x` (the total space required for 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - Otherwise, the remaining 1x1 icons need to be placed on additional screens. The number of additional screens required is calculated as:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`
     - If `extra_space` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - The total number of screens required is the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` (if any).

### Verification with Test Cases:

Let's verify the logic with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon can fit on one screen.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `7 2`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Two 2x2 icons occupy 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 7 1x1 icons.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `12 4`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Four 2x2 icons occupy 16 cells, requiring 2 screens. The remaining 12 1x1 icons fit on the second screen.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `0 3`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Three 2x2 icons require 2 screens.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `1 0`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One 1x1 icon fits on one screen.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `8 1`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 8 1x1 icons.

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `0 0`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No icons, no screens needed.

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - Input: `2 0`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Two 1x1 icons fit on one screen.

9. **Test Case 9:**
   - Input: `15 0`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Fifteen 1x1 icons fit on one screen.

10. **Test Case 10:**
    - Input: `8 2`
    - Output: `2`
    - Explanation: Two 2x2 icons occupy 8 cells, requiring 2 screens. The remaining 8 1x1 icons fit on the second screen.

11. **Test Case 11:**
    - Input: `0 9`
    - Output: `5`
    - Explanation: Nine 2x2 icons require 5 screens.

All test cases are correctly handled by the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case based on the given logic.

Correctness: **True**
