The code snippet assigns the value of `space_x // 15` to the variable `extra_screen`. This means `extra_screen` will be the integer division of `space_x` by 15.

Given the initial state, `space_x` is equal to `x`, so `extra_screen` will be `x // 15`.

The other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` is greater than 1, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + x`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `result` is a list containing one element `screen_require_for_y` if `x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, or `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y]` where `extra_screen` is `x // 15` if `x` is divisible by 15, or `x // 15 + 1` if `x` is not divisible by 15, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is `x // 15`**.
