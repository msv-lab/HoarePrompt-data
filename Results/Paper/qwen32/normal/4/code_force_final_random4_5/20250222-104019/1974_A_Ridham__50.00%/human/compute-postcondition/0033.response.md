The code snippet appends `screen_require_for_y` to the `result` list. This means that the `result` list will now contain two elements: the original `screen_require_for_y` and another `screen_require_for_y`.

Given the initial state, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` is greater than 1, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + x`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `result` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `screen_require_for_y`.**
