Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**

In simple terms: The value of `space_y` is now `y * 4`. All other variables retain their initial values.
