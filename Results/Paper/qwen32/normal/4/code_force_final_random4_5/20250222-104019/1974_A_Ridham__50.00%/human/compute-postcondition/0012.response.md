Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `remaining_cells` has been calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. All other variables retain their initial values.
