The given code snippet calculates `extra_screen` by performing integer division of `space_x` by 15. This affects the value of `extra_screen` but does not change any other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `x` and `y` are integers read from input
- `space_x` is equal to `x` and `space_x % 15 == 0`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `result` is an empty list
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`
- `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`
- `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd
- `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`
- `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`
- `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`

After executing the code `extra_screen = space_x // 15`, the value of `extra_screen` is updated to be `space_x // 15`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x` and `space_x % 15 == 0`, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15`**.
