Output State: **The loop has executed `n` times, and `result` is a list containing `n` elements. Each element in `result` is determined by the values of `x` and `y` read from input for each iteration. Specifically, for each iteration, `space_x` is equal to `x`, and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`. The variable `total_space` holds the sum `space_y + space_x`. The variable `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd. The variable `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the corresponding element in `result` is `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `result` is calculated as `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is divisible by 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not divisible by 15.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `result` contains a list of `n` values, each calculated based on the input values of `x` and `y` for that iteration, following the rules specified in the loop.
