To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates over values of `i` from 2 to `root` (inclusive), where `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. During each iteration, it calculates `cnt` as `i * i` and updates `ans` by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to it.

Let's break down the final state after all iterations:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`: The initial value read from the input.
   - `k`: The second integer read from the input (not used in the loop).
   - `ans`: Initially set to `n`.
   - `root`: Calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for `i` from 2 to `root`.
   - For each `i`, `cnt` is calculated as `i * i`.
   - `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to it.

3. **Final State:**
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
   - `root` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` is updated multiple times based on the loop iterations.

Given the information about the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `root`. The final value of `ans` will be the sum of the initial value of `n` and the values added during each iteration of the loop.

**Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

In natural language, the final output state is:

- `n` remains the initial input value.
- `k` remains the second input value (though it is not used in the loop).
- `root` remains `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
- `ans` is the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `root`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **n remains the same, k remains the same, root remains int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, ans is n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for i from 2 to root.**
