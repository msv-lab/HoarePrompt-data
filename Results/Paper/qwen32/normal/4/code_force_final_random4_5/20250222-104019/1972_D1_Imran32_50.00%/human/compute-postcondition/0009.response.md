The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `root`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these variables. If `i` is less than `root + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 (since the range starts at 2 and increments by 1 each iteration), and `root` must be at least 3 for the loop to have executed this far. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `root` must be at least 4.

State: **`i` is 4, `root` must be greater than or equal to 4**
