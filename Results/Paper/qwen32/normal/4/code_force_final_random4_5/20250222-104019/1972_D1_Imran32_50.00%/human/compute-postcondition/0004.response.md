The code snippet provided is `cnt = i * i`. This line calculates the square of the variable `i` and assigns it to the variable `cnt`. However, the initial state does not specify any value for `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `cnt` without knowing `i`. We can only express `cnt` in terms of `i`.

The variables `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `root` remain unchanged by this code snippet. Thus, their initial states are preserved.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `k` is an integer, `ans` is `n`, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, `cnt` is `i * i`**.
