### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Name and Parameters**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads `n` and `k` from the input, but the problem description specifies `n` and `m`. This inconsistency is noted in the original assessment.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The logic in the program does not align with the problem's requirements. The program calculates `ans` and iterates through a loop that computes a sum based on divisors, which is unrelated to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Example Verification**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that while the program outputs `1` for the first test case `(1, 1)`, this is coincidental and not due to correct logic.
   - For the fourth test case `(10, 8)`, the program outputs `14`, which is correct by chance, but the underlying logic is not correct.

4. **Incorrectness**:
   - The example provided in the original assessment (`n = 2, m = 3` with expected output `3` and program output `4`) clearly demonstrates that the program's logic is incorrect.

### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program after reading inputs and performing calculations, but they do not reflect the problem's conditions.
- The annotations state that `ans` is calculated based on the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` from `2` to `root`, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program does not correctly solve the problem. The provided logic does not match the conditions specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect.
