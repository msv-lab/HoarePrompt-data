To determine the new state after the code executes, we first need to calculate the new value of `ans` based on the provided code snippet. Here's the step-by-step evaluation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be at least 4
   - `k` is an integer
   - `ans` is `n + (n + 3) // 9`
   - `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`
   - `cnt` is 9
   - `i` is 3

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet modifies `ans` by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to it.

3. **Calculation:**
   - `i` is 3 and `cnt` is 9, so `(n + i) // cnt` becomes `(n + 3) // 9`.
   - New value of `ans` is `ans + (n + 3) // 9`.

4. **Substituting the initial value of `ans`:**
   - Initial `ans` is `n + (n + 3) // 9`.
   - New `ans` is `n + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 3) // 9`.
   - Simplifying, new `ans` is `n + 2 * (n + 3) // 9`.

**Output State:**
Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `k` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 2 * (n + 3) // 9`, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, `cnt` is 9, `i` is 3**.
