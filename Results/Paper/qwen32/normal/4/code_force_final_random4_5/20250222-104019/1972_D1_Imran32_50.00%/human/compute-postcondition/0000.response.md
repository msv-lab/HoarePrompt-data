The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. Given the initial state, the values of `n` and `m` are not relevant to this specific code execution, as the code only updates `n` and `k` with new input values. The number of test cases `t` is also not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers read from the input. The initial constraints on `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**
