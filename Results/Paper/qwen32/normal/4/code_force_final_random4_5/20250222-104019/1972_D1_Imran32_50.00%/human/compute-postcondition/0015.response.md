Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` which is `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` ranging from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus one. It then prints the result `ans` for each test case.**
