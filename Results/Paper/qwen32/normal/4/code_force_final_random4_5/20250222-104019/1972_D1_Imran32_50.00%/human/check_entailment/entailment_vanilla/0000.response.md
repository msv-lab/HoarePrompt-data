Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the given program does not implement this logic. Instead, it seems to calculate a different quantity involving square roots and divisors, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. However, `func_1()` does not correctly parse the input for `n` and `m` for each test case. It reads `n` and `k` instead of `n` and `m`. This is a typo and the program should read `n` and `m`.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The core logic in `func_1()` is completely unrelated to the problem. The program calculates `ans` based on the number of divisors and square roots, which does not match the problem's requirement of checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated `ans`, which is not the correct count of valid pairs for each test case.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This can be done efficiently by leveraging the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd).

Correctness: **False**
