Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine the output.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- The current value of `k` is 1.

**Python Code Snippet:**
```python
print(1)
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not influence the output of this particular `print` statement because the statement is hardcoded to print the number `1`.

**Explanation:**
- The `print(1)` statement will output the number `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

**Output:**
Output: **1**
