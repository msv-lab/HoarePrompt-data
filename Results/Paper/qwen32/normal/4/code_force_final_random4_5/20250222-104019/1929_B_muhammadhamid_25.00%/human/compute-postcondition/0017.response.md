To determine the output of the `print(k // 2 + 1)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable `t` does not affect the current print statement and can be ignored for the purpose of this task.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- If `k` is 1, it remains 1; otherwise, `k` retains its original value.
- The current value of `k` satisfies either `k <= 2 * n` or `k > 2 * n`.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement in question is:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Explanation:
- `k // 2` is the integer division of `k` by 2. This operation will yield the largest integer less than or equal to \( \frac{k}{2} \).
- Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` shifts the value up by 1.

### Possible Values of `k`:
- If `k` is 1, then `k // 2` is 0, and `k // 2 + 1` is 1.
- If `k` is any other integer, then `k // 2` will be an integer value based on the division, and adding 1 will give the final output.

### Final Output:
The output of `print(k // 2 + 1)` will be an integer value that is `k // 2 + 1`, where `k` is the integer read from the input and adjusted according to the conditions provided.

Thus, the output can be described as:
Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the integer read from the input and adjusted according to the conditions provided)**
