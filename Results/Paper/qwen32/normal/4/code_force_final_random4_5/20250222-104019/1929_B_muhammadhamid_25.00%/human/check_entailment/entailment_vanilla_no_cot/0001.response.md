Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires coloring the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. Diagonals in the grid can be categorized into two sets: those running from top-left to bottom-right (\( n \) diagonals) and those running from top-right to bottom-left (\( n-1 \) diagonals on each side, totaling \( 2n-2 \) diagonals). Therefore, the total number of diagonals is \( 4n - 2 \).

### Strategy
To minimize the number of colored cells, we should aim to color each cell in such a way that it covers as many diagonals as possible. The optimal strategy is to color cells on the main diagonals (both top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left) because these cells will cover the maximum number of diagonals.

1. **Single Diagonal**: If \( k = 1 \), we only need to color 1 cell.
2. **Up to \( 2n \) Diagonals**: If \( k \leq 2n \), we can color cells such that each cell covers 2 diagonals (one from each set). Therefore, the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
3. **More than \( 2n \) Diagonals**: If \( k > 2n \), we need to cover additional diagonals. After covering \( 2n \) diagonals, we need to cover the remaining \( k - 2n \) diagonals. Each additional cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, but since we've already used up the cells that can cover two diagonals from both main diagonals, we need to use additional cells. The formula for this is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \), but since we know we've already used up \( n \) cells (each covering 2 diagonals except the middle one which covers only 1 diagonal in case of odd \( n \)), we need to adjust for the remaining diagonals. The formula simplifies to \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) which can be approximated to \( k // 2 + 1 \) when \( k > 2n \).

### Program Analysis
The given program follows the above strategy:

- For \( k = 1 \), it correctly prints 1.
- For \( k \leq 2n \), it correctly computes \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
- For \( k > 2n \), it computes \( k // 2 + 1 \).

Let's verify the examples provided in the problem statement with the given program:

1. **Input**: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)
   - \( k \leq 2n \) (4 <= 6)
   - Output: \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
2. **Input**: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)
   - \( k \leq 2n \) (3 <= 6)
   - Output: \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
3. **Input**: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)
   - \( k > 2n \) (10 > 6)
   - Output: \( k // 2 + 1 = 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \)
4. **Input**: \( n = 3, k = 9 \)
   - \( k > 2n \) (9 > 6)
   - Output: \( k // 2 + 1 = 9 // 2 + 1 = 5 \)
5. **Input**: \( n = 4, k = 7 \)
   - \( k > 2n \) (7 > 8)
   - Output: \( k // 2 + 1 = 7 // 2 + 1 = 4 \)
6. **Input**: \( n = 7, k = 11 \)
   - \( k > 2n \) (11 > 14)
   - Output: \( k // 2 + 1 = 11 // 2 + 1 = 6 \)
7. **Input**: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)
   - \( k > 2n \) (3 > 4)
   - Output: \( k // 2 + 1 = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2 \)

All outputs match the expected results.

### Conclusion
The program correctly computes the minimum number of cells required for each test case based on the given conditions.
