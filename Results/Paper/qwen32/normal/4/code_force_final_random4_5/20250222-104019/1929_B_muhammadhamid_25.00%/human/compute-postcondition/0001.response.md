The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. Since `t` is not affected by the code snippet, its value remains the same. The values of `n` and `k` are determined by the input, so we need to include them in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
