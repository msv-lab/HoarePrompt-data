Let's carefully analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) contain at least one colored cell.
- The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
- The program needs to handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program handles the input and computes the minimum number of cells to color based on the conditions given:
```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```
Let's break down the logic:
1. **For \( k = 1 \)**:
   - The program correctly prints 1, as only one cell is needed to cover one diagonal.
2. **For \( k \leq 2n \)**:
   - The program prints \( \lceil k/2 \rceil \). This logic works because:
     - In the best-case scenario, each cell can cover two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
     - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can place cells in such a way that each cell covers two diagonals, and if \( k \) is odd, one more cell is needed.
3. **For \( k > 2n \)**:
   - The program prints \( k//2 + 1 \). This logic works because:
     - If \( k > 2n \), we need to cover more diagonals, so we need to place cells in a way that maximizes the number of diagonals covered per cell.
     - The formula \( k//2 + 1 \) ensures that we cover the required diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases to ensure correctness.
