To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem requirements and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \). 

### Observations

1. **Diagonals in a Grid:**
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from the top-left to the bottom-right (main diagonals).
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from the top-right to the bottom-left (anti-diagonals).
   - Total diagonals: \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Minimum Cells to Color:**
   - If \( k = 1 \), we only need to color one cell, which will cover one diagonal.
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), it is possible to color cells such that each diagonal is covered by coloring cells along the main and anti-diagonals. The minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) because each cell can cover at most two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
   - If \( k > 2n \), we need to color more cells. In this case, the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). However, since we can only cover up to \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals with each cell being part of one main and one anti-diagonal, we need to account for the additional diagonals. The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) can be simplified to \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) for integer division.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution correctly implements the above logic:

- If \( k = 1 \), it prints 1.
- If \( k \leq 2n \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
- If \( k > 2n \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) using `k // 2 + 1`.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **Input:** `3 4`
   - \( k = 4 \leq 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
   - \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
   - **Output:** `2`

2. **Input:** `3 3`
   - \( k = 3 \leq 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
   - \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
   - **Output:** `2`

3. **Input:** `3 10`
   - \( k = 10 > 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
   - \( \lceil \frac{10}{2} \rceil = 5 \)
   - **Output:** `6` (since \( k // 2 + 1 = 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \))

4. **Input:** `3 9`
   - \( k = 9 > 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
   - \( \lceil \frac{9}{2} \rceil = 5 \)
   - **Output:** `5` (since \( k // 2 + 1 = 9 // 2 + 1 = 5 \))

5. **Input:** `4 7`
   - \( k = 7 \leq 2 \times 4 = 8 \)
   - \( \lceil \frac{7}{2} \rceil = 4 \)
   - **Output:** `4`

6. **Input:** `7 11`
   - \( k = 11 > 2 \times 7 = 14 \)
   - \( \lceil \frac{11}{2} \rceil = 6 \)
   - **Output:** `6` (since \( k // 2 + 1 = 11 // 2 + 1 = 6 \))

7. **Input:** `2 3`
   - \( k = 3 > 2 \times 2 = 4 \)
   - \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
   - **Output:** `2` (since \( k // 2 + 1 = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2 \))

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed to color for each test case based on the conditions given in the problem.
