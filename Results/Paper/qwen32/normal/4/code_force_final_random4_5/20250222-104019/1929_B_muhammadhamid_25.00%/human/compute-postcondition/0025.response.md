To determine what will be printed by the `print(k // 2 + 1)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the formula used in the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable `t` is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this particular task.
2. **`n` and `k`**: These are integers read from the input. The value of `k` is adjusted according to the following rule:
   - If `k` is 1, it remains 1.
   - Otherwise, `k` retains its original value.
3. **Condition on `k`**: The value of `k` satisfies either:
   - \(k \leq 2 \cdot n\)
   - \(k > 2 \cdot n\)

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```
- `k // 2`: This is integer division of `k` by 2, which means it will yield the largest integer less than or equal to \(k/2\).
- `+ 1`: After the integer division, 1 is added to the result.

### Possible Values of `k`:
Since `k` can be any integer and is subject to the conditions mentioned, let's consider the formula `k // 2 + 1` for different values of `k`:
- If `k` is 1, then `k // 2` is 0 (since 1 divided by 2 is 0.5, and integer division truncates to 0). Adding 1 gives 1.
- If `k` is 2, then `k // 2` is 1, and adding 1 gives 2.
- If `k` is 3, then `k // 2` is 1, and adding 1 gives 2.
- If `k` is 4, then `k // 2` is 2, and adding 1 gives 3.
- And so on...

### General Case:
For any integer `k`, the expression `k // 2 + 1` will yield the integer part of \(k/2\) plus 1.

### Output:
Based on the above analysis, the print statement will output the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the adjusted value of k based on the input conditions)**
