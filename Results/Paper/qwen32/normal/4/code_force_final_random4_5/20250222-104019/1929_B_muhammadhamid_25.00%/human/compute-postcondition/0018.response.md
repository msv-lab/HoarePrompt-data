Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. If `k` was 1, it remains 1; otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The current value of `k` satisfies either `k <= 2 * n` or `k > 2 * n`.**

Since the postconditions for both the if and else parts are identical and describe the same state of the variables, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition with the added condition that `k` is evaluated against `2 * n`.
