The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. If `k` was 1, it remains 1; otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The current value of `k` satisfies either `k <= 2 * n` or `k > 2 * n`.**
