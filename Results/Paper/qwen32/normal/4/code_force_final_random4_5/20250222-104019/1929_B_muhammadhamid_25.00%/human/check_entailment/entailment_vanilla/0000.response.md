Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Grid and Diagonals**: 
    - The square grid is of size `n x n`.
    - There are `4n - 2` diagonals in total. These include:
        - `n` diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (main diagonals and their extensions).
        - `n` diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left (anti-diagonals and their extensions).
        - Two of these diagonals are the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the grid.

2. **Objective**:
    - Sasha wants to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

3. **Key Observations**:
    - If `k <= 2 * n`, then it is possible to color cells in a way that each colored cell covers two diagonals (one from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left). Thus, the minimum number of cells needed is `ceil(k / 2)`.
    - If `k > 2 * n`, then some diagonals will not be able to share a cell with another diagonal. Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is `k // 2 + 1` because we need to ensure that the remaining diagonals each get at least one unique cell.

### Program Analysis

Let's verify the provided program against the above analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cells**:
    - If `k == 1`, the program correctly outputs `1` because only one cell is needed to cover one diagonal.
    - If `k <= 2 * n`, the program correctly calculates `ceil(k / 2)` using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
    - If `k > 2 * n`, the program correctly calculates `k // 2 + 1`.

### Conclusion

The program handles all cases correctly based on the logic derived from the problem analysis. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
