You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: After all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` test cases, where for each test case, the values of `n` and `k` are read from the input. If `k` is 1, the output for that test case is 1. Otherwise, the output is calculated as `math.ceil(k / 2)` if `k <= 2 * n`, or `k // 2 + 1` if `k > 2 * n`. The variables `n` and `k` are reset for each new test case, and `t` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Grid and Diagonals**: 
    - The square grid is of size `n x n`.
    - There are `4n - 2` diagonals in total. These include:
        - `n` diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (main diagonals and their extensions).
        - `n` diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left (anti-diagonals and their extensions).
        - Two of these diagonals are the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the grid.

2. **Objective**:
    - Sasha wants to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

3. **Key Observations**:
    - If `k <= 2 * n`, then it is possible to color cells in a way that each colored cell covers two diagonals (one from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left). Thus, the minimum number of cells needed is `ceil(k / 2)`.
    - If `k > 2 * n`, then some diagonals will not be able to share a cell with another diagonal. Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is `k // 2 + 1` because we need to ensure that the remaining diagonals each get at least one unique cell.

### Program Analysis

Let's verify the provided program against the above analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cells**:
    - If `k == 1`, the program correctly outputs `1` because only one cell is needed to cover one diagonal.
    - If `k <= 2 * n`, the program correctly calculates `ceil(k / 2)` using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
    - If `k > 2 * n`, the program correctly calculates `k // 2 + 1`.

### Conclusion

The program handles all cases correctly based on the logic derived from the problem analysis. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
