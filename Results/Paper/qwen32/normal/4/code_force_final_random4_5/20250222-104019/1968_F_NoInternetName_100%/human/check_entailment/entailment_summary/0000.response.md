### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: For a given subarray, determine if it can be split into more than one part such that the XOR of each part is equal.
2. **Key Observation**: A subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero. This is because if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, it implies that there exists a way to split the array into parts where the XOR of each part is zero, and if all parts XOR to zero, they must all be equal.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads a line of input and converts it to integers. It is used to read the number of test cases, the size of the array, the number of queries, the array itself, and the queries.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function performs a binary search to find the largest index `l` such that a given predicate is true for `arr[l]`.
3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is a wrapper around `func_2` and simply calls it.
4. **Function `func_4`**: This function also wraps `func_2` but adds 1 to the result if it is not `None`.
5. **Function `func_5`**: This function processes each test case. It calculates the prefix XOR of the array and uses a dictionary to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero by comparing the prefix XOR values at the start and end of the subarray. If the XOR is zero, it prints "Yes". If not, it uses the binary search functions (`func_3` and `func_4`) to find if there exists an intermediate index where the prefix XOR value matches the end XOR value and falls within the bounds of the query, indicating that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.

#### Verification:
- **Correctness**: The logic in `func_5` is correct for determining if a subarray is "interesting". The use of prefix XOR and binary search to find potential split points is a valid approach. The code handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
- **Output**: The output is consistent with the problem description. It prints "Yes" or "No" based on whether the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR based on the given problem description.

**Correctness:** **True**
