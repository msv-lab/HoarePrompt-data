Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **`a`**: This is a list returned by `func_1(int)`. The exact contents of `a` are not specified, but we know it is a list.
2. **`n` and `q`**: These are values returned by `func_1(int)`, with the constraint that `q` must be greater than 0. The exact values of `n` and `q` are not specified.
3. **`l` and `r`**: These are new values returned by `func_1(int)` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`. The exact values of `l` and `r` are not specified.
4. **`x`**: This is a list where the first element is `0`, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the previous element in `x` with the next element in `a`. So, `x` will look something like `[0, a[0], a[0] ^ a[1], a[0] ^ a[1] ^ a[2], ...]`.
5. **`inds`**: This is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs. For example, if `x` is `[0, 1, 3, 2]`, then `inds` might be `{0: [0], 1: [1], 3: [2], 2: [3]}`.
6. **`lower`**: This is assigned the value of `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`. The function `func_4` is not defined, but it seems to be a function that finds an index in the list `inds[x[r]]` where the condition `arg < l` holds. If no such index exists, it defaults to `0`.
7. **`upper`**: This is assigned the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. Similarly, `func_3` is not defined, but it seems to be a function that finds an index in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the condition `arg <= r` holds.
8. **Comparison of `upper` and `lower`**: If `upper` is greater than `lower`, then `upper` remains greater than `lower`. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.
9. **`i`**: This is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but since `i` is not used in the print statement, its value is irrelevant to the output.

### Code Execution
The provided code snippet is simply:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Output Determination
The print statement `print('Yes')` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects defined in the initial state. It will always print the string `'Yes'`.

### Final Answer
Output: **Yes**
