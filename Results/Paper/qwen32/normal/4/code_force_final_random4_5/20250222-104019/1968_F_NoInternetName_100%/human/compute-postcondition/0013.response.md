Let's analyze the code snippet and the impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
```

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element.
- `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
- `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i, 0, 0]`. Given `0 ^ i` is `i` (since `0 ^ i` is a bitwise XOR operation that results in `i` when `0` is XORed with `i`), `x` can be rewritten as `[0, i, 0, 0]`.
- `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[0, 1]`.
- `i` is the next element in `a`.

Let's break down the impact of the code snippet:
- `x[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `x`, which is `0`.
- `len(x) - 1` is the index of the last element in the list `x`, which is `3` because `x` has 4 elements (indices 0, 1, 2, 3).
- `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends `3` to the list `inds[0]` because `x[-1]` is `0`.

Thus, `inds[0]` will now be `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.

The values of `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `i`, and the structure of `inds` for `inds[i]` remain unchanged. Only the list `inds[0]` is updated.

Output State: **`a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element, `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, i, 0, 0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]` and `inds[i]` is `[0, 1]`, `i` is the next element in `a`.**
