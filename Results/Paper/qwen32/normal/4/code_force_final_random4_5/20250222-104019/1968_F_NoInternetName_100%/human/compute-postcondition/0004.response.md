The code `inds[0].append(0)` modifies the `inds` defaultdict by appending the value `0` to the list stored at the key `0`. Since `inds` is a defaultdict of lists, if the key `0` does not exist, it will be created with an empty list, and then `0` will be appended to this list. If the key `0` already exists, `0` will be added to the existing list.

Given the initial state, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists, and after the execution of the code, `inds[0]` will be `[0]`.

Output State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0]`.**
