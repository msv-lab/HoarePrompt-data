Output State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists.**

In this output state, the variable `inds` is initialized as a defaultdict of lists, while the other variables retain their initial values.
