The code snippet appends the index `len(x) - 1` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Given the initial state, `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i, 0]`, and `inds[0]` is `[0, 1]`.

1. Calculate `len(x) - 1`: Since `x` has 3 elements, `len(x) - 1` is `2`.
2. `x[-1]` is the last element of `x`, which is `0`.
3. Append `2` to `inds[0]`, which was initially `[0, 1]`. After appending, `inds[0]` becomes `[0, 1, 2]`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `inds[i]` for `i != 0`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element, `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i, 0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[0, 1]`, `i` is the next element in `a`.**
