The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the next element in the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be the next element in `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element.
- `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
- `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i, 0]`.
- `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[0, 1]`.
- `i` is the next element in `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken the value of the current element in `a`. For the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `a`.

Let's denote the current value of `i` as `a[j]`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `a[j+1]`.

Since we do not have the exact list `a` or the current index `j`, we can only express the state in terms of the next element in `a`.

State: **`a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element, `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i, 0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[0, 1]`, `i` is the next element in `a`**.

However, to be more precise about the state of `i`, we can say:
State: **`a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element, `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i, 0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[0, 1]`, `i` is the next element in `a` after the current `i`**.

Since we don't have the exact list or the current index, we can simply state that `i` is the next element in `a`:
State: **`a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element, `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i, 0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[0, 1]`, `i` is the next element in `a`**.
