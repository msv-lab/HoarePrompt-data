Output State: **`a` remains the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` remain the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0] + [cumulative XOR results]` where each element is the XOR of the previous element in `x` with the next element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs, `lower` is recalculated based on the new `l` and `r` as `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`, `upper` is yet to be recalculated based on the new `l` and `r`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, then the conditions remain as stated; otherwise, there is no change in the variables.**

In simpler terms, the variable `lower` is updated to a new value based on the current value of `r` and `l`. The other variables remain unchanged unless `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, in which case additional conditions might apply, but those are not specified to change any variables further.
