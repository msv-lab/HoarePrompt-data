Given the initial state and the Python code snippet provided, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print('No')` statement is executed.

Let's break down the key parts of the initial state:

1. `a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)`.
2. `n` and `q` are values returned by `func_1(int)`, with `q` being greater than 0.
3. `l` and `r` are new values returned by `func_1(int)` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`.
4. `x` is a list where the first element is `0`, and subsequent elements are cumulative XOR results of elements in `a`.
5. `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs.
6. `lower` is assigned the value of the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `0` if no such index exists.
7. `upper` is assigned the value of the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
8. `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.

The `print('No')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `inds`, `lower`, or `upper`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('No')` statement is:

Output: **No**
