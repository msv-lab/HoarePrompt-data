The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The precondition for `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**
