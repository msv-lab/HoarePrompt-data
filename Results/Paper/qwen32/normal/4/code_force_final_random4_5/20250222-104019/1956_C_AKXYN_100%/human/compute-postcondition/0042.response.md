To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `res` is 110 (though `res` is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n` (though `mat` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is `n-3`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is defined as `n-3`.
   - Since `n` is at least 1, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1.
   - If `n = 1`, then `i = 1-3 = -2`.
   - However, if `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be a larger negative number or a non-negative number depending on the value of `n`.
   - For the sake of a precise answer, we need to assume a specific `n` value, but since it's not provided, we'll use the general form.

2. **`range(1, n + 1)`:**
   - This generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - For example, if `n = 5`, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

3. **The `print` statement:**
   - `'2 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object and prints each element in the sequence.

### Output:
Given the information, the output will be:
- The string `'2 %d' % i` will print `2` followed by the value of `i`.
- The unpacked `range(1, n + 1)` will print all integers from 1 to `n`.

Since `n` is not specified, we'll represent the output in terms of `n` and `i`.

Output: **2 [i], 1 2 3 ... n (where i is n-3 and n is the number of rows/columns in the matrix `mat`)**

For a concrete example, if `n = 5` (a common small value for demonstration):
- `i = 5 - 3 = 2`
- `range(1, 5 + 1)` generates `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

Output: **2 2, 1 2 3 4 5**

However, since `n` is not explicitly provided, the most precise answer is:

Output: **2 [i], 1 2 3 ... n (where i is n-3 and n is the number of rows/columns in the matrix `mat`)**
