Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `res` is 110 (though `res` is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `i` is `n-3`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'1 %d' % i`**:
   - This is a string formatting operation where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
   - `i` is given as `n-3`.
   - Therefore, `'1 %d' % i` will be formatted to `'1 [value of i]'`, which is `'1 [n-3]'`.

2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence so that each number is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
   - Therefore, this part of the print statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Combining the Results:
- The first part of the print statement will output `'1 [n-3]'`.
- The second part will output the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
The final output will be a string starting with `'1 [n-3]'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Format the Final Output:
Output: **1 [n-3] 1 2 3 ... n (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**

To make it more precise and clear, let's represent it in the format requested:

Output: **1 [n-3] 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the number of rows and columns in the matrix `mat`)**
