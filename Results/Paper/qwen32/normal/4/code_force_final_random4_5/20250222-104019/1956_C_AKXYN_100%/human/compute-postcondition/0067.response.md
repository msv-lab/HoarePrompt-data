Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n × n matrix filled with zeroes. It processes multiple test cases, where the total number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. The function returns the n × n matrix filled with zeroes for each test case.**
