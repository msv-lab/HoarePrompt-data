The variable `n` is reassigned the value of the integer input provided by the user. The values of `res`, `t`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 110, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is the new input integer, `mat` is a matrix with the new `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`res` is 110, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is the new input integer, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 0**.
