The code creates a matrix `mat` where each row is a list of integers from 1 to `n`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but `mat` is newly created.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500; `n` is an input integer; `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`.**
