The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop is iterating from `n` down to `1` with a step of `-1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` should be `n-3`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it defines the range of the loop.

State: **`res` is 110, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n-3`**
