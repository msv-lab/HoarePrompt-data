Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n × n matrix a filled with zeroes. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
    print(res, n << 1)
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: res is 110, t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, n is the input integer, mat is a matrix with n rows and n columns where each row contains integers from 1 to n, i is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: res is 110, t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, n is a positive integer greater than 0, mat is a matrix with n rows and n columns where each row contains integers from 1 to n, i is 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
