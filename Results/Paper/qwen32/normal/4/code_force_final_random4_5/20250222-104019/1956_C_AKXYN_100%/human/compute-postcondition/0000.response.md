In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the range is determined by the integer input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

The state before the loop starts includes the integer `t`, which is the number of test cases. Since the loop condition is `for _ in range(int(input()))`, the only variable we can adjust within the loop head is `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Given the task, the state before the loop starts needs to ensure that `t` is a positive integer, as this is the only variable affecting the loop execution based on the loop head.

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500**
