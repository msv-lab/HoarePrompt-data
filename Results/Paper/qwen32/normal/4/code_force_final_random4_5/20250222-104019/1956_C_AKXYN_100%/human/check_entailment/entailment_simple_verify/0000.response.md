Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve permuting rows or columns of the matrix. The maximum possible sum is achieved when each element in the matrix is the highest possible value, which can be done by strategically permuting rows and columns.

### Program Analysis

#### Sum Calculation
The program calculates the sum using the formula:
```python
res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
```
This formula is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), which is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times.

For example, for \( n = 2 \):
- Correct maximum sum: \( 2 \times \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 6 \)
- Sum calculated by the program: \( (0 + 1) \times (2 \times 0 + 1) + (1 + 1) \times (2 \times 1 + 1) = 1 + 6 = 7 \)

#### Operations
The operations printed by the program are:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
    print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```
These operations do not ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum. The operations should be designed to fill each row and column with a permutation that maximizes the sum.

For example, for \( n = 2 \):
- The matrix should look like:
  ```
  1 2
  2 1
  ```
- The operations to achieve this could be:
  ```
  1 1 1 2
  2 2 2 1
  ```

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix or the operations required to achieve that sum. The logic for calculating the sum and the operations does not align with the problem description.

#### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The original assessment is correct. The program is indeed incorrect.
