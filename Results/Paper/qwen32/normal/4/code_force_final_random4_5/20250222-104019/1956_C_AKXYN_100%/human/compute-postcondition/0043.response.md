To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates from `n` down to `1`, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration. The loop prints two lines in each iteration, but these print statements do not affect the variables `res`, `t`, `n`, `mat`, or `i` in a way that changes their values.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `0` (since the loop stops when `i` becomes `0` after the last decrement).

Therefore, the final output state will be:

Output State: **res is 110, t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, n is the input integer, mat is a matrix with n rows and n columns where each row contains integers from 1 to n, i is 0**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `i` will be `0`, and all other variables (`res`, `t`, `n`, and `mat`) will remain unchanged from their initial values.
