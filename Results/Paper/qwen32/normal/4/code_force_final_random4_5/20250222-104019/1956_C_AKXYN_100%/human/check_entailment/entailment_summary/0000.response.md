**Reasoning:**

The program follows a specific pattern to maximize the sum of the matrix. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with each row being a permutation from 1 to `n`. However, the actual values in the matrix are not used directly; the program calculates the sum based on a formula.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum `res` is calculated using the formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\). This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix in a smart way, where the largest numbers are placed in a way that maximizes the overall sum. The formula essentially calculates the sum of a series of numbers that represent the maximum possible sum for a given `n`.

3. **Operations**: The program then prints operations to fill the matrix. It prints `n << 1` (which is `2n`) operations, where each operation is either a Type 1 or Type 2 operation. The operations are designed to fill the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum, although the operations themselves do not change the pre-calculated sum.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the calculated sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The operations are printed in reverse order of the rows, but the order of operations does not affect the final sum since the sum is pre-calculated.

The program is designed to work within the constraints and provide the correct maximum sum for the matrix. The operations printed are a strategy to fill the matrix, but the actual sum is determined by the formula, which is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and outputs the operations within the allowed limit of `2n` operations. The operations printed are a valid strategy to fill the matrix, although they do not change the pre-calculated sum. Therefore, the program is correct.
