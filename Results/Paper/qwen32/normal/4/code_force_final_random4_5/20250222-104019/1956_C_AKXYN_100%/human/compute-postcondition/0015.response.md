The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n` down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 1, and the loop will only execute again if `i` is greater than 0. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to 2 (the value it would have been before the last iteration).

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 2**
