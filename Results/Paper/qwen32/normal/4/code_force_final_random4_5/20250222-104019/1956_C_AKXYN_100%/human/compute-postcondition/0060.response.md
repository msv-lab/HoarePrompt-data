Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State Recap:
- `res` is 110 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n` (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is `n - 2`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Breakdown of the Print Statement:
1. **`'1 %d' % i`**:
   - This part of the print statement uses string formatting to insert the value of `i` into the string. 
   - Since `i` is `n - 2`, the string will be formatted as `'1 [n-2]'`.

2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so each number in the range will be printed as a separate argument.

### Combining the Parts:
- The first part of the output will be `'1 [n-2]'`.
- The second part will be the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
- The output will be a string starting with `'1 [n-2]'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the output will depend on the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and its exact value is not specified, we will represent it as `n`.

Output: **1 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... n (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**

To make it more precise and easily understandable, let's specify that `n` is a placeholder for the actual value:

Output: **1 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the number of rows and columns in the matrix `mat`)**
