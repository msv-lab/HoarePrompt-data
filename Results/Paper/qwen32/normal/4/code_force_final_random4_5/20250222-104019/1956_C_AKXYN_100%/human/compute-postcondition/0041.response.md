Let's break down the print statement and the given initial state to determine the output.

1. The variable `i` is defined as `n-3`. However, the exact value of `n` is not given. Since `n` must be at least 1, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1. But for `i` to be a valid index (non-negative), `n` must be at least 3. Let's assume `n` is at least 3 for the sake of this problem.

2. The print statement is `print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`. Let's break this down:
   - `'1 %d' % i` will format the string to include the value of `i`. Since `i` is `n-3`, this will print `1` followed by the value of `i`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` will unpack the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and print them separated by spaces.

Given that `i` is `n-3`, let's assume the smallest possible `n` that makes `i` a valid index, which is `n = 3`. This would make `i = 3 - 3 = 0`.

So, if `n = 3`, the range `*range(1, n + 1)` will be `*range(1, 4)`, which unpacks to `1 2 3`.

Putting it all together:
- `'1 %d' % i` will be `'1 0'` because `i` is `0`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)` will be `1 2 3`.

Therefore, the complete output will be `1 0 1 2 3`.

Output: **1 0 1 2 3**
