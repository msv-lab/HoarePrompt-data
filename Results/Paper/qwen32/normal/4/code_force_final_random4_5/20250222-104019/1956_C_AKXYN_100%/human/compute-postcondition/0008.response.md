The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` from its previous value. `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `2 * (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`**
