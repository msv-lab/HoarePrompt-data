The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This value represents the number of test cases that will follow. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned to exist in the context of the test cases, but they are not yet assigned values in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are yet to be assigned values.**
