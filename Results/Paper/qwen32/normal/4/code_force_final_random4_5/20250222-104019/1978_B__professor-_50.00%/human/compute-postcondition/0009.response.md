To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression step by step using the initial state provided.

The print statement is:
```python
print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
```

Let's denote the expression inside the `print` statement as `result`.

1. **Calculate \( b - a \)**:
   - This is the difference between `b` and `a`. Since `b` is greater than `a`, \( b - a \) is a positive integer.

2. **Calculate \( (b - a) / 2 \)**:
   - This is half of the difference between `b` and `a`. Since `b - a` is an integer, the division by 2 could result in a float. However, it will be converted to an integer by the `int()` function later.

3. **Calculate \( (b - a) + 1 \)**:
   - This is one more than the difference between `b` and `a`. It is an integer.

4. **Calculate \( (b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) \)**:
   - This part of the expression is the product of the two previous calculations. Since both terms involve integers and the division is followed by conversion to an integer, the result is an integer.

5. **Calculate \( a * n \)**:
   - This is the product of `a` and `n`. Both `a` and `n` are integers, so the result is an integer.

6. **Sum the two parts**:
   - The final `result` is the sum of the two integer parts calculated above.

Putting it all together, the expression can be described as:
\[ \text{result} = \left\lfloor \frac{b - a}{2} \right\rfloor \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n \]

Where:
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{b - a}{2} \right\rfloor \) is the integer division of \( b - a \) by 2.
- \( (b - a + 1) \) is one more than the difference between `b` and `a`.
- \( a \times n \) is the product of `a` and `n`.

Based on the given conditions, we can't compute the exact numerical value without specific values for `a`, `b`, and `n`. However, we can describe the output precisely as follows:

Output: **result (where result is calculated as the integer value of \(\left\lfloor \frac{b - a}{2} \right\rfloor \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n\))**
