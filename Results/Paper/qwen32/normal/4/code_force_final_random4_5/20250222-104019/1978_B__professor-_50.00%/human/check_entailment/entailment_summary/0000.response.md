### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program's logic to determine if it correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case.

1. **Case when `b <= a`:**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it's never beneficial to sell any buns at the modified price because it wouldn't increase the profit. Thus, Bob should sell all `n` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The formula `n * a` correctly calculates the profit in this case.

2. **Case when `b - a >= n`:**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is at least the number of buns `n`, Bob can sell all buns at the modified price and still get a higher profit than the usual price.
   - The formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` correctly calculates the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`, which represents the total profit from selling all buns at the modified price.

3. **Case when `b - a < n`:**
   - Here, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` is intended to calculate this. However, there's a mistake in this formula. It should correctly calculate the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the modified prices and then add the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.
   - The correct formula should be: `sum of first (b - a) terms of (b, b-1, ..., b - (b - a) + 1) + a * (n - (b - a))`.
   - The sum of the first `m` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `x` and decreasing by 1 each time is `m * (2*x - m + 1) / 2`. Here, `m = b - a` and `x = b`, so the sum is `(b - a) * (2*b - (b - a) + 1) / 2 = (b - a) * (b + a - b + a + 1) / 2 = (b - a) * (2*a + 1 - b) / 2`.
   - The correct formula should thus be: `(b - a) * (2*a + 1 - b) / 2 + a * (n - (b - a))`.

Given the above analysis, the formula in the code for the third case is incorrect, and this needs to be fixed for the program to be correct.
