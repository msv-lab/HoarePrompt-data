To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the expression inside the `print` function and understand the roles of the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `t` is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.

The print statement is:

```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
```

Let's break down the expression step-by-step:

1. **Expression Analysis**:
   - `2 * b`: This multiplies the integer `b` by 2.
   - `2 * b - n`: This subtracts the integer `n` from the result of `2 * b`.
   - `2 * b - n + 1`: This adds 1 to the result of `2 * b - n`.
   - `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`: This multiplies the result of `2 * b - n + 1` by `n`.
   - `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`: This divides the result of `(2 * b - n + 1) * n` by 2. The division is floating-point division.
   - `int(...)`: This converts the result of the division to an integer, effectively truncating any decimal part.

2. **Value of the Expression**:
   - The expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` calculates a value based on the inputs `n` and `b`. Since `a` is mentioned in the initial state but not used in the print statement, it does not affect the output.
   - The exact numerical value depends on the specific values of `n` and `b`.

3. **Output Description**:
   - The output of the print statement is the integer value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.

Since `n` and `b` are not provided with specific values, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n` and `b`.

Output: **The integer value of the expression \((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2\)**
