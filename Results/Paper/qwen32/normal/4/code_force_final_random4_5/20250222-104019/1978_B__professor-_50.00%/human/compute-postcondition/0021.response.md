Let's break down the given task and determine what will be printed based on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 2, where \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input from the user.
- There is an `if` statement checking if `b` is less than or equal to `a`. If true, the `if` block executes; otherwise, the `else` block executes.
- The `print` statement we are concerned with is `print(n * a)`.

### Analysis:
- The value of `t` does not affect the `print` statement `print(n * a)`.
- The values of `n` and `a` are directly used in the `print` statement.
- The value of `b` is only used to determine which block of code (if or else) will execute, but it does not affect the `print` statement `print(n * a)`.

### What Will Be Printed:
- The `print` statement `print(n * a)` will output the product of `n` and `a`.

### Output:
Output: **n * a (where n and a are integers input from the user)**
