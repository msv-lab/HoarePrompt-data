The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means the initial values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the input. The values of `t` remain unchanged as per the initial state description, while `n`, `a`, and `b` are reassigned.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases minus 2, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input from the user. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition of the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition of the else statement is satisfied.**
In simpler terms: The value of `t` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now the integers provided in the input. The condition for the if-else statement remains the same based on the new values of `a` and `b`.
