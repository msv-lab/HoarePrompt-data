Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

- `t` is an input integer within the range 2 to 1000.
- `n` is a newly input integer.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `res` is initialized to 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(res)
```

From the initial state, we know that `res` is explicitly initialized to 0. There are no operations or changes to `res` mentioned in the given information before the print statement. Therefore, the value of `res` remains 0.

Thus, the print statement will output the value of `res`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
