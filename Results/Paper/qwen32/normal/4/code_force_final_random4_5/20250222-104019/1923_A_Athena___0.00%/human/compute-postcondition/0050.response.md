Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 999.
- `n` is a newly input integer.
- `a` is an empty list `[]`.
- `res` is 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(a)
```

Since `a` is explicitly defined as an empty list `[]` in the initial state, the `print(a)` statement will output this exact list.

Output: **[]**
