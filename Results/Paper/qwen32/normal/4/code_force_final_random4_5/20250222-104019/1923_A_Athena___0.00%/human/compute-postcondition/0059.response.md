The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of the variable `res` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 999, `n` is a newly input integer, `a` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `k + 2`, `res` is incremented by 1.**
