The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the initial state of `a` is `[0]`, after the `pop` operation, `a` will be an empty list `[]`.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `res` are not affected by the `pop` operation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 2 to 1000, `n` is a newly input integer, `a` is [], `res` is 0**.
