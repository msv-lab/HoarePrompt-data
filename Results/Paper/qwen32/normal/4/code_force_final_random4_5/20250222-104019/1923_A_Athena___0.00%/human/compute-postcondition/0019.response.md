To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the print statement:

1. `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000. This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
2. `n` is the newly input integer. This variable is also not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
3. `a` is a list of integers with all trailing 0s removed. The exact contents of the list `a` are not specified, but we know that it does not contain any trailing zeros.
4. `res` is initialized to 0. This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a)
```

Since `a` is a list of integers with all trailing 0s removed, the output will be the list `a` as it is, without any trailing zeros.

Output: **a (where a is a list of integers with all trailing 0s removed)**
