To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head: `a and a[0] == 0`.

1. **Condition `a`:** This condition checks if the list `a` is not empty. Therefore, `a` must contain at least one element.
2. **Condition `a[0] == 0`:** This condition checks if the first element of the list `a` is equal to 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
- **Adjusting `a`:** Since `a` is a list of integers, and the loop requires `a` to be non-empty, we need to ensure that `a` contains at least one element.
- **Adjusting `a[0]`:** The first element of the list `a` must be 0 for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, `a` must be a list that contains at least one element, and that first element must be 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `res` are not part of the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 999, `n` is a newly input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 (e.g., `[0, ...]`), and `res` is 0**
