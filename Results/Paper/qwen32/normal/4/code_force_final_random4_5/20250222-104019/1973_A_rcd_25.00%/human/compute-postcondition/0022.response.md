Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be at least `low + 1`. If the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. `cur` is now `cur + 1`.**

In natural language: The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still odd, and `p3` is still less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. The values of `low` and `high` remain the same. The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1.
