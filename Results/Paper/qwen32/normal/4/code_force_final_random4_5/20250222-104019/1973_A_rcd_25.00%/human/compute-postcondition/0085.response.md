Given the provided loop and the initial and intermediate states, we can infer the behavior of the loop for all iterations. The loop processes each set of three integers (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`) for `t` iterations. Here's the breakdown of what happens in each iteration:

1. **Check if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd**:
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next iteration.
   - If the sum is even, the program proceeds to check if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

2. **If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`**:
   - The program prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

3. **If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`**:
   - The program calculates `low` and `high` based on the differences between `p3` and `p1`, and `p3` and `p2`.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a value `cur` such that `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If such a `cur` is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If no such `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, it is clear that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is always odd in each of these cases, leading the program to print `-1` and move to the next iteration.

Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is always odd for all iterations, the program will print `-1` for each iteration. Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is a series of `-1` prints corresponding to each test case.

Output State: **-1 printed `t` times.**

In natural language: The output state after all executions of the loop is that the program prints `-1` for each of the `t` test cases, as the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is always odd in each test case.
