Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `p3` remains unchanged as well. Since the if condition `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` is always true given the precondition, the behavior described in the if part is the only outcome.**
