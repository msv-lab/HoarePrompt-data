Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` remains unchanged; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and the condition for `high` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
