Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be at least `low + 1`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1`. If the condition is not met and the else part is executed, `cur` is incremented by 1.**
