Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` remains unchanged; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`; the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` holds true; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` do not change. The only impact of the code is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
