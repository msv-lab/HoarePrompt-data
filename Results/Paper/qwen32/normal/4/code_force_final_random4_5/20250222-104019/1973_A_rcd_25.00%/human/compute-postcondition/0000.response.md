The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state describes the conditions for the scores of three players and the number of test cases. After executing the provided code, only the variable `t` is updated with the input value, and the conditions for the scores and the number of test cases remain unchanged.

Output State: **Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order; `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
