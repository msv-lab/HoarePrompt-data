Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` remains unchanged; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`; `cur` is increased by 1.**

In natural language: The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain the same as they were initially read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still odd. The value of `p3` does not change. The value of `low` remains the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. The condition that `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1` still holds. The value of `cur` is now one more than its previous value.
