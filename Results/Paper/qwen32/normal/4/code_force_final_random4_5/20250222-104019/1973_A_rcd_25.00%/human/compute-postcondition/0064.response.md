The code calculates the minimum and maximum of the differences between `p3` and `p1` and `p3` and `p2`, and assigns them to `low` and `high` respectively. The value of `p3` remains unchanged. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still odd. 

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` remains unchanged; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.**
