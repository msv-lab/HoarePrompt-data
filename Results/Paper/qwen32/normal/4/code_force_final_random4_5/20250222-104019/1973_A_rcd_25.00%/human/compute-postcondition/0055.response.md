Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be at least `cur`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1. `cur` must be less than `high`.**

In simpler terms: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain integers with their sum being odd. `low` and `high` are calculated based on the differences between `p3`, `p1`, and `p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1, provided `cur` is less than `high`.**
