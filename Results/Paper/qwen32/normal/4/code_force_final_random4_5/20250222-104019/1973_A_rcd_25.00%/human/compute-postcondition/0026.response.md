Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `high` must be at least `cur + 1`. `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` depending on the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If the condition is not met and the else part is executed, `cur` is incremented by 1. The loop or if statement is broken out of.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
