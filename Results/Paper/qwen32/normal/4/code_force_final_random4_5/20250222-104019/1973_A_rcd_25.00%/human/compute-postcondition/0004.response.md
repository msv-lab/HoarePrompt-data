The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state provides information about the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, which are integers read from the input, and it specifies that their sum is odd. However, this information does not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

The `print(-1)` statement will output the integer `-1` regardless of the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Output: **-1**
