Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `tests` must be greater than 0.
2. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
3. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
4. `a` is an input string.
5. `b` is a new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
6. `c` is a new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
7. `i` is 1.
8. `slength` is an input integer.
9. `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`.
10. `x` is the character at index 1 in `c`.
11. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print('YES')` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `tests`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `slength`, or `x`.
- The statement `print('YES')` will execute regardless of the conditions specified in the initial state because it is not conditional on any of those variables or the logic described.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will simply output the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
