Given the initial state, we have several variables defined with specific conditions and values. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `tests`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `slength`, or `no`.

Here's the breakdown of the variables provided:
- `tests` is greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `a` and `b` are input strings, with `b` consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `c` is a value provided by the input.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `slength` is an integer value provided by the input.
- `no` is a boolean value set to `True`, indicating that `c` is neither equal to `a` nor `b` and not all elements of `c` are in `a` or `b`.

Despite these conditions and values, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```
This statement will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **NO**
