The code snippet `tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The variable `tests` is now assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
