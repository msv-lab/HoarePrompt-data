The code snippet `c = input()` assigns the value of the new input string to the variable `c`. This input is expected to consist of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tests` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer.**
