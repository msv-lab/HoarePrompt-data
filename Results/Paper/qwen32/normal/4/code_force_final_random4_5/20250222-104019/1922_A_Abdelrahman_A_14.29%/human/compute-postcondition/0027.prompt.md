Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, `no` is True, and `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`.
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a and x not in b:
        print('YES')
        no = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tests` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, and `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tests` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 1, `slength` is an input integer, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and `x` is the character at index 1 in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tests` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 1, `slength` is an input integer, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and `x` is the character at index 1 in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, `no` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without modifying `no`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
