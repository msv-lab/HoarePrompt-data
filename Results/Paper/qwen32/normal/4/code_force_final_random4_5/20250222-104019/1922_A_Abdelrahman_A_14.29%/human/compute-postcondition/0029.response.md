Postcondition: **`tests` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0 if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, otherwise `i` is `n`, `slength` is an input integer, and `no` is True.**
