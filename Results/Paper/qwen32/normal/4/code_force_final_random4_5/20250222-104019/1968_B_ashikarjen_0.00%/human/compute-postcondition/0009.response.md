Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a binary string of length `n` read from input; `b` is a new binary string read from input where `b[0]` is the opposite of `a[0]`; `k` is 0; `j` is 2**.

Natural Language: The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so `j` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
