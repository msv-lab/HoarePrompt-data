The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `j` are not affected by this operation. The precondition that `j` is equal to `m` and `j` is less than `m` is contradictory and cannot be true simultaneously. Therefore, we will keep the precondition as given, acknowledging the contradiction.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `m`. The current value of `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is incremented by 1.**
