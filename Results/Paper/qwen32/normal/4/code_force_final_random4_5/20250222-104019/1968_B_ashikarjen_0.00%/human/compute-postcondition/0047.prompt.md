Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a binary string of length `n` read from input; `b` is a new binary string read from input; `k` is 0; `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
        j += 1
    if j < m:
        k += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a binary string of length `n` read from input; `b` is a new binary string read from input where `b[0]` is the opposite of `a[0]`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is set to 1 and `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is 0 and `j` is equal to `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `m`. If `j` was originally less than `m`, then `j` is updated to `m + 1` and `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains equal to `m` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `j` is `m`, and `k` is increased by 1 if `j` was originally less than `m`. Otherwise, `i` remains 1 and `j` remains `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
