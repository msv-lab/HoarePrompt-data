To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that both conditions in the loop head are satisfied:

1. `j < m`
2. `b[j] != a[i]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `j` is 2
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `b[1]` must not be equal to `a[i]`

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **Condition `j < m`:** 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` (which is 2) must be less than `m`.
   - Therefore, `m` must be greater than 2.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - The condition requires that `b[2]` (since `j` is 2) must not be equal to `a[i]`.
   - We need to ensure that `b[2]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the value of `a[i]` will be different from the previous iteration. However, we don't have specific values for `a[i]` or `b[2]`, so we just need to ensure that `b[2]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m` is greater than 2 and `b[2]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**
