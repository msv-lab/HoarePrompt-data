Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `m`. The current value of `j` is less than `m`.** 

(Note: The statement "The current value of `j` is less than `m`" is inherently contradictory based on the given precondition where `j` is defined as equal to `m`. Therefore, this specific if condition `(j < m)` would never be true under the provided precondition. However, if we strictly follow the task to include both the precondition and the if condition in the postcondition, the above is the result.)
