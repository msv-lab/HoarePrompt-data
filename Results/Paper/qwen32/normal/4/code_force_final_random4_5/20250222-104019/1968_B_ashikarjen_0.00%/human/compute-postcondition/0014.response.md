Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and m are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; a is a binary string of length n read from input; b is a new binary string read from input where b[0] is the opposite of a[0]; k is 1; j is an integer less than m.**

In this output state, the variable `k` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
