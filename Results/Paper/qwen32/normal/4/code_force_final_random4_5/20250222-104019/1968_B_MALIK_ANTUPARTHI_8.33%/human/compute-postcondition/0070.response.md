The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `b` and `c`. The initial values of `b` and `c` are not relevant as they are overwritten. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` and `c` are integers obtained from the input with `b` > 0 and `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
