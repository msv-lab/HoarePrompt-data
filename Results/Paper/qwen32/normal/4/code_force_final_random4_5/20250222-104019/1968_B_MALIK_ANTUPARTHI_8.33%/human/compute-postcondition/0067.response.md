To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it breaks or continues.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `b-1`. For each iteration `j`, it checks if the character `d[j]` is present in the substring `e[k:]`. If it is, `k` is updated to the position of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. If `k` reaches `c` or if `j` is the last iteration (`b-1`), the loop breaks and `k` is set to `j + 1`. If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to `j` and the loop breaks.

### Output State Analysis:
- **Loop Completion**: The loop will execute all `b` iterations if, for each `j` from 0 to `b-1`, `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]` and `k` does not reach `c` before the last iteration.
- **Loop Breaking Conditions**:
  - If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, the loop breaks, and `k` is set to `j`.
  - If `k` reaches `c` at any point, the loop breaks, and `k` is set to `j + 1`.
  - If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `k` is set to `b`.

### Final Output State:
- **`j`**: If the loop completes all `b` iterations, `j` will be `b-1`. Otherwise, `j` will be the value at which the loop breaks.
- **`k`**: If the loop completes all `b` iterations, `k` will be `b`. If the loop breaks because `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` will be `j`. If the loop breaks because `k` reaches `c`, `k` will be `j + 1`.

### Output State:
Given that the loop either completes all iterations or breaks at some point, the final output state will be:

- If the loop completes all `b` iterations:
  - `j` is `b-1`
  - `k` is `b`

- If the loop breaks at some iteration `j`:
  - `j` is the value at which the loop breaks
  - `k` is either `j` (if `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`) or `j + 1` (if `k` reaches `c`)

Since we are asked to describe the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, we consider the scenario where the loop completes all iterations:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations without breaking early, `j` will be `b-1` (the last index of the loop), `k` will be `b` (indicating that the loop completed all iterations without `k` reaching `c` or `d[j]` not being found in `e[k:]`), and `i` will have been incremented by 1.
