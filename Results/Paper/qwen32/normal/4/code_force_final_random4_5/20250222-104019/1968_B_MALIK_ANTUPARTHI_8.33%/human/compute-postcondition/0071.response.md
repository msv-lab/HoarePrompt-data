Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` and `c` are integers obtained from the input with `b` > 0 and `a` ≥ 1; `d` is the new input string; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `d` is updated to the new input string. All other variables retain their previous values.
