Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new input string; `j` is 0; `k` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`; the character `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]`; `k` is now equal to `j`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` has been updated to be equal to the value of `j`, which is 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
