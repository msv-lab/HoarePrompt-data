The code snippet `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` based on the value of `j`. Given that `j` is 2, `k` will be updated to 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` and `a` are integers obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are strings obtained from the input; `j` is 2; `k` is 3.**
