Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to read a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then prints the minimum and maximum of these two integers in that order. However, there is a logical error in the provided program. The program incorrectly prints `x` before `y` when `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` before `x` when `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. This means the program outputs the maximum and minimum instead of the minimum and maximum.

The correct behavior should be to print the smaller number first and then the larger number. The logic should be reversed. Here is the corrected logic:
- If `x > y`, print `y x` (not `x y`).
- If `x <= y`, print `x y` (not `y x`).

The provided program does not match the expected output as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
