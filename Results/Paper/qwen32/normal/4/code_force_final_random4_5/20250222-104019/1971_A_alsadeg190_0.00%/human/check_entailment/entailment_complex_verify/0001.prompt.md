You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the last input pair, `y` is the second integer from the last input pair such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9, and `i` is equal to `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints the larger of the two integers followed by the smaller one.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program is intended to solve the problem as described. However, there is a logical error in the print statements inside the loop. The program is supposed to print the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. But in the current implementation, if `x > y`, it prints `x` first, which is incorrect. It should print `y` first in that case. The correct print statements should be:

- If `x > y`, print `y` then `x`.
- If `x <= y`, print `x` then `y`.

The current implementation does the opposite, which means it does not correctly output the minimum and maximum values in the required order.

Correctness: **False**
