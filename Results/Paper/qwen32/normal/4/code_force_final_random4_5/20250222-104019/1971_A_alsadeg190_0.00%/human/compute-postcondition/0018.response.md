To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given loop and its behavior:

The loop runs `x` times, where `x` is the integer input by the user. During each iteration, the loop:
1. Reads a new pair of integers from the input.
2. Prints the integers in non-decreasing order.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9, these variables do not change during the loop iterations and remain the same after the loop completes.

The loop variable `i` increments from 0 to `x-1`, controlling the number of iterations.

After all iterations are complete:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `x` and `y` are the values from the last input pair read during the loop.
- `i` will be equal to `x` (the loop has completed `x` iterations).

The output state after all iterations will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the last input pair, `y` is the second integer from the last input pair such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9, and `i` is equal to `x`.**

In simpler terms, `t` stays the same, `x` and `y` are the values from the final input pair, and `i` matches the number of iterations `x`.
