Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical error in the conditional statement that determines the order of the output. Specifically, the program is supposed to print the minimum of the two integers followed by the maximum, but it currently prints the larger integer first if `x > y`. This contradicts the problem statement, which requires the output to be the minimum followed by the maximum.

Here is the problematic part of the code:

```python
if x > y:
    print(x, y)
else:
    print(y, x)
```

This should be corrected to:

```python
if x > y:
    print(y, x)
else:
    print(x, y)
```

With this correction, the program will output the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum, as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
