The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts those parts into integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state indicates that `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` have specific conditions. After executing the code, `x` and `y` will be updated with the new input values. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
