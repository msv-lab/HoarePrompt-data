Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9, and `i` is `i + 1`. Regardless of whether `x > y` or not, the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain the same except that `i` is incremented by 1.**
