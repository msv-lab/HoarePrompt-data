The code snippet `x = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and for each of the `t` test cases, `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 9. After executing the code, `x` will be updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The value of `t` and the initial value of `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the integer input by the user, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.**
