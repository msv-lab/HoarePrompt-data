The `print(x, y)` statement will output the values of `x` and `y` based on the initial state provided.

From the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. However, `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `x` is the first integer from the input and `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.
- `x` is greater than `y`.

Given these conditions, `x` and `y` have specific values, but since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of the conditions they satisfy.

Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the input and y is the second integer from the input such that x > y and 0 ≤ y ≤ 9)**
