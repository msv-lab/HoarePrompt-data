The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The variables `cnt`, `cur`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `i` is `t - 2`; `n`, `k`, and `m` are the integers read from the input.**
