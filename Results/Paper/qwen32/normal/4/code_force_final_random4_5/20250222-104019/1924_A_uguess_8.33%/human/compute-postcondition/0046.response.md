To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the variables involved.

The loop iterates `k` times, and in each iteration, it checks if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0. If it is, it sets `tmp` to the character `chr(ord('a') + i)`. However, the value of `tmp` is not used anywhere in the provided snippet, and `i` is not explicitly used outside the loop. The loop simply checks each of the first `k` bits of `cur`.

After the loop completes, `i` will have taken on all values from 0 to `k-1`. The final value of `tmp` will be the character corresponding to the last `i` where the `i`-th bit of `cur` was 0. If no such bit was found, `tmp` will remain as it was set in the last iteration where the condition was met.

Given the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue this process until `i` reaches `k-1`. The final state of `tmp` will be determined by the last `i` where the `i`-th bit of `cur` was 0.

**Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the input string; `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`; `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`; `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + i)` where `i` is the largest integer less than `k` such that the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0; `ans` is a string consisting of the k-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.****

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `tmp` will hold the character corresponding to the last bit (from the first `k` bits) in `cur` that was 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
