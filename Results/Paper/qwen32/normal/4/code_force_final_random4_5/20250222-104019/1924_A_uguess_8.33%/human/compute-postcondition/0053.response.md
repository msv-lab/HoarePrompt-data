The code snippet `s = input()` reads a new string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. This means the value of `s` is updated to whatever the new input string is. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the newly input string; `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`; `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
