Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is `t - 2`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1. The current value of `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1` with the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1.**

Natural language: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1, while the other bits in `cur` remain as they were, which is `(1 << k) - 1` with the bit at position `cur_ss` now set to 1.
