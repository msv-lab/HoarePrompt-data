Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the input string; `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`; `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function maintains the current state. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + i)` where `i` is the largest integer less than `k` such that the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0; `ans` is a string consisting of the k-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times followed by `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.**
