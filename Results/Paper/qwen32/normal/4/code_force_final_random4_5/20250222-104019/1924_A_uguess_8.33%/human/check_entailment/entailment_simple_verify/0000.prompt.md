You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000. The string s is of length m and consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.

    #State: `t` iterations of the loop have completed, and for each iteration, the program determines whether the string `s` contains at least `n` sequences of all `k` distinct characters in any order. If it does, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string `ans` that consists of the `k`-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, the character `tmp` (the highest-indexed character not yet encountered in the last incomplete sequence), and 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. 

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Counting Subsequences**: The program attempts to count how many distinct subsequences of length `k` it can find in `s`. However, the logic used to count these subsequences is incorrect. The program uses a bitmask to track which characters have been seen in the current subsequence, but it does not correctly handle the logic for forming subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: The program's logic for generating a missing subsequence is flawed. It constructs a string that may not be a valid missing subsequence, especially when `cnt` is less than `n`.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
2 2 3
abb
```

The program should output:
```
NO
aa
```

However, the provided program might output something incorrect because it does not correctly determine that `aa` is a missing subsequence.

### Another Example:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

The program should output:
```
NO
aaa
```

However, the program might not correctly identify `aaa` as a missing subsequence.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not found as a subsequence, print `NO` followed by that string.
4. If all strings are found, print `YES`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_subsequence(s, t):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in t)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        alphabet = ''.join(chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(k))
        found_all = True
        missing_string = ""
        for i in range(k**n):
            candidate = ''.join(alphabet[j] for j in [(i // (k**p)) % k for p in range(n)])
            if not is_subsequence(s, candidate):
                found_all = False
                missing_string = candidate
                break
        if found_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            print(missing_string)

# func()  # Uncomment to run the function
```

This corrected version correctly checks all possible strings of length `n` and determines if they are subsequences of `s`. If any string is not found, it correctly identifies and prints a missing string.
