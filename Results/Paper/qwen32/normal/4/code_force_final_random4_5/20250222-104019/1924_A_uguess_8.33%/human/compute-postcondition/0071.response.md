Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is incremented by 1; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'); The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`. If `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1 before the if statement, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is reset to 0; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` retains its value. If `cur` was not equal to (1 << k) - 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0.**
