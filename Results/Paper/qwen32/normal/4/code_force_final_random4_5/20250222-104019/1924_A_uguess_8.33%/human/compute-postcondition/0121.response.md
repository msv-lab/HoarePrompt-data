Postcondition: **`cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is `t - 2`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is `s[1]`, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. `cur` is updated based on the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`.**
