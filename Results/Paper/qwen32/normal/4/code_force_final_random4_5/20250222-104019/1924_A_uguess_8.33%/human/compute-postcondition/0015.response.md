The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ss` for the loop to execute one more time. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cur_ss`, `cur`, and `cnt`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was the last character processed from the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` remains unchanged. `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**
