The code snippet initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the input string; `cnt` is 0.**
