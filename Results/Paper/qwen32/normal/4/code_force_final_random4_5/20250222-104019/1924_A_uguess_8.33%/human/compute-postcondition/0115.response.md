The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ss` to reflect the start of the next iteration. According to the loop, `ss` will take on the next character in the string `s` during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt` is 0
- `i` is `t - 2`
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input
- `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character
- `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`
- `cur` is updated based on the value of `cur_ss` and potentially `cnt` is set to 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`

At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was `s[0]`. For the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[1]`.

State: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is `t - 2`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is `s[1]`, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`, `cur` is unchanged from the previous iteration**
