Postcondition: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is `t - 2`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was originally 0, then `cur` is updated to have the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
