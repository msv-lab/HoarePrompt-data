The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again, and `k` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 from its previous value at the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in `s`; `cur` is the bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so `i` is now 4 (assuming it was 3 at the end of the last iteration); if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + i)`**

Since the exact previous value of `i` is not specified, let's denote it as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

To be more specific, if we assume `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.
