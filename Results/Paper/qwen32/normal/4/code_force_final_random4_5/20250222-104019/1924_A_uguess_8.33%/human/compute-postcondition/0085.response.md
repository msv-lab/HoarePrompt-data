The code snippet assigns the variable `ans` the value of a string consisting of the character corresponding to `k-1` positions after 'a', repeated `cnt` times. The values of `cnt`, `cur`, `i`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `i` is `t + 1`; `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is an empty string; `ans` is a string of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`**.
