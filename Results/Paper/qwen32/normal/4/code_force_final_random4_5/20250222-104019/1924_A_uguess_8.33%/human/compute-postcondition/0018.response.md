Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` remains unchanged. `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering the condition and the operations performed in the if part.
