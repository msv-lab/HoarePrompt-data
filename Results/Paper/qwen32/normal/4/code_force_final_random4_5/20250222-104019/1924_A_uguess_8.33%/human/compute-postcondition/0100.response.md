Postcondition: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` remains `t + 1`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is set to `k - 1`, `ans` is a string of `cnt + 1` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a', and `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.**
