The `print('NO')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `cnt`, `cur`, `k`, `s`, or `n`. The precondition provides information about the variables `cnt`, `cur`, `k`, `s`, and `n`, but these do not influence the output of this specific print statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in the string `s`.
- `cur` is the bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print('NO')` statement. The statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
