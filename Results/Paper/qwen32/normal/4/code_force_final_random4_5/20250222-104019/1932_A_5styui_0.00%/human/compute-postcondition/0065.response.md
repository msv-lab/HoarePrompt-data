Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `d` is the input integer; `b` is a non-empty input string; `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `j` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and `j` must be less than the length of `b`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
