The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `b`. If `j` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than the length of `b`.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `j` as the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `d` is the input integer; `b` is a non-empty input string; `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `j` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and `j` must be less than the length of `b`. If `b[j]` is '@', `s` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
