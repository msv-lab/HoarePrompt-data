Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic provided in the program is incorrect for determining the maximum overlap of fireworks from both installations.

The current program uses a simple formula to calculate the number of fireworks visible from each installation within the visibility period `m + 1` and adds 2 to it, which is incorrect. The correct approach involves finding the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible within the same time frame and considering the overlap between the two sequences of launches.

Here is a more detailed and correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible within the first `m + 1` minutes.
2. Calculate the number of fireworks from the second installation that are visible within the first `m + 1` minutes.
3. Calculate the number of fireworks that are visible from both installations simultaneously (i.e., the number of fireworks from the first installation that overlap with the fireworks from the second installation).
4. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the sum of the fireworks from both installations minus the overlap.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        fireworks_a = (m + a) // a
        fireworks_b = (m + b) // b
        fireworks_both = (m + lcm_ab) // lcm_ab
        max_fireworks = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - fireworks_both
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time by taking into account the overlap of fireworks from both installations.
