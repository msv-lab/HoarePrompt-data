### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
- Two installations launch fireworks at intervals `a` and `b` minutes.
- Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after its launch.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads `t` number of test cases. For each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Condition Check (`m < a or m < b`)**:
   - If `m < a`, the first installation will not launch any fireworks within the first `m` minutes, and the second installation will launch only one firework within the first `m` minutes. Similarly, if `m < b`, the second installation will not launch any fireworks within the first `m` minutes, and the first installation will launch only one firework within the first `m` minutes. In both cases, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2` (one from each installation). This part of the logic seems correct.

3. **Calculation (`m // a + m // b + 2`)**:
   - The logic here is flawed. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks. The formula does not consider the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations.
   - For example, if `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`, the correct answer is `2`, not `m // a + m // b + 2 = 4 // 6 + 4 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2`. This is coincidental.
   - For another example, if `a = 3`, `b = 4`, and `m = 10`, the correct answer is `7`, but the formula gives `10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7`, which is again coincidental.

Let's consider a more complex example to further illustrate the issue:
- Suppose `a = 3`, `b = 4`, and `m = 10`. The fireworks launched by the first installation will be visible at times `[0, 3, 6, 9]` and the fireworks launched by the second installation will be visible at times `[0, 4, 8]`. The simultaneous visibility periods are:
  - At `t = 0`, both fireworks are visible.
  - At `t = 3`, only the first firework is visible.
  - At `t = 4`, only the second firework is visible.
  - At `t = 6`, only the first firework is visible.
  - At `t = 8`, only the second firework is visible.
  - At `t = 9`, only the first firework is visible.
  - At `t = 10`, both fireworks are visible.
  - At `t = 11`, only the first firework is visible.
  - At `t = 12`, only the first firework is visible.
  - At `t = 13`, only the first firework is visible.
  - At `t = 14`, only the second firework is visible.
  - At `t = 15`, only the first firework is visible.
  - At `t = 16`, only the first firework is visible.
  - At `t = 17`, only the first firework is visible.
  - At `t = 18`, only the first firework is visible.
  - At `t = 19`, only the first firework is visible.
  - At `t = 20`, both fireworks are visible.
- The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is `7` (from `t = 0` to `t = 10`).

The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not account for the correct simultaneous visibility periods and is not generally correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously for all cases. The formula used does not account for the overlap of visibility periods correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
