The given print statement is:
```python
print(2)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `2`. The initial state provides information about the variables `a`, `b`, `m`, `t`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the print statement.

Output: **2**
