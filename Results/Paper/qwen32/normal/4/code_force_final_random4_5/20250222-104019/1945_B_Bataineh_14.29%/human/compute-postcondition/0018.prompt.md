Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18) where a and b represent the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and m represents the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky. There are `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) test cases. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m < a or m < b:
        print(2)
    else:
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is not adjusted. If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, then either `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`. Otherwise, `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1. Regardless of whether `m` is less than `a` or `b`, the values of `a`, `b`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `t` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`. Regardless of whether `m < a` or `m < b`, the values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
