Postcondition: ***`n` and `m-1` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q_next + r) % n` and `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing the element `(q - r) % n`. `ans` is a set containing at least one more element; `q` is the next element in `ans` after `q_next`.***
