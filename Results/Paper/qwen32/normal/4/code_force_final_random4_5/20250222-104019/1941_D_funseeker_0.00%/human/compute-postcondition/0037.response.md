The code adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. Given that `q` is updated to `q_next` in the initial state, the new element is `(q_next + r) % n`.

The other variables (`n`, `m-1`, `x`, `r`, `c`, `ans`, and `q_next`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m-1` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q_next + r) % n`, `(q_next - r) % n`, and `(q_next + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing the element `(q_next + r) % n`; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `q` is `q_next`.**
