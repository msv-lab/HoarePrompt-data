The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `m-1` is greater than 0, which means `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be decremented by 1, so `m` should now be `m-1`.

State: **`n` and `m-2` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`. `ans` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`.**
