The only object in the loop head is the variable `q`, which iterates over the elements in the set `ans`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `q` to be the next element in `ans`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `m-1` are greater than 0.
- `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`.
- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.
- `ans` is a set containing at least one element.

To execute the loop one more time, `q` should be the next element in the set `ans`. Since sets are unordered, we cannot determine the exact next element, but we can denote it as `q_next`, which is another element from the set `ans`.

State: **`n` and `m-1` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q_next + r) % n` and `(q_next - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `q` is `q_next`.**
