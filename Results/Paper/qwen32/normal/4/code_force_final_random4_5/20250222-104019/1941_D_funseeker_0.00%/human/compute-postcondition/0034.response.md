The code adds a new element to the set `temp`, which is calculated as `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m-1` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'; `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`; `ans` is a set containing at least one element.**
