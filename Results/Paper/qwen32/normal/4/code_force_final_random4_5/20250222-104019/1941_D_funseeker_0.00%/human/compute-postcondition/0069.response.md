Output State: **`n` and `m-2` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing all elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`. `ans` is a set containing all unique values `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`.** 

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `temp` will contain all the computed values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` set, depending on the value of `c`. The `ans` set will also contain all these unique computed values. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
