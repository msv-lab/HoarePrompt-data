Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is a string representing the input value.
2. `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` ten times.
3. `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` ten times.
4. `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the last input string `t` by spaces.
5. `i` is 0.
6. `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

### Analysis:
- Since `i` is 0, we are interested in the first elements of `x` and `y`.
- `x` and `y` are constructed from the first and second substrings of `t`, respectively, each repeated ten times.
- The condition `x[i] >= y[i]` suggests that the first element of `x` is greater than or equal to the first element of `y`.

### Output Calculation:
- `y[i]` is the first element of the list `y`, which is the integer value of the second substring of `t`.
- `x[i]` is the first element of the list `x`, which is the integer value of the first substring of `t`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the first element of `y` followed by a space, and then the first element of `x`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `t`, we can't provide the exact numerical values for `y[i]` and `x[i]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the substrings of `t`.

Output: **[second substring of t as an integer]  [first substring of t as an integer] (where the first substring of t is converted to an integer and stored in x[0], and the second substring of t is converted to an integer and stored in y[0])**
