The code snippet `t = input()` reads a value from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since `t` was initially an integer, after this operation, `t` becomes a string because `input()` in Python reads input as a string. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 9; `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.**
