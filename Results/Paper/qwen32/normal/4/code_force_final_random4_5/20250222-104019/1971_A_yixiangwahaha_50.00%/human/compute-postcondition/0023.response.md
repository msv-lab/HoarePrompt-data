Let's break down the given information step by step:

- `t` is a string representing the input value.
- `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` repeated ten times.
- `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` repeated ten times.
- `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string `t` by spaces.
- `i` is set to 1.
- The condition checks if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`. If true, `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`; otherwise, `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

Given this information, let's assume `t` is a string like `"10 20"`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Splitting the string `t`**: `xylist` will be `['10', '20']`.
2. **Converting substrings to integers and creating lists `x` and `y`**:
   - The first substring is `'10'`, so `x` will be `[10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`.
   - The second substring is `'20'`, so `y` will be `[20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20]`.
3. **Index `i` is set to 1**:
   - `x[1]` is `10`.
   - `y[1]` is `20`.

Now, the `print` statement will output the values of `x[1]` and `y[1]` with a space in between.

Output: **10  20**
