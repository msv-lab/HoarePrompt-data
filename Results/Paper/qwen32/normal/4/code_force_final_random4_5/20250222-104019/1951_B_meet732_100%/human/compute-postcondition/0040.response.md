Given the conditions and the code snippet, we need to evaluate the return statement `return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])`.

From the initial state:
- `ind` is a list containing up to 2 indices where `a[i] > x`.
- `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1 (i.e., `ind` has exactly 2 elements).
- The first element of `ind` is not 0.
- `k` is greater than the second element of `ind`.

Since `ind` has exactly 2 elements, we can denote them as `ind[0]` and `ind[1]` where `ind[0] < ind[1]`.

The return statement `return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])` will evaluate to the maximum of two values:
1. `ind[0] - 1`
2. `ind[1] - ind[0]`

Given that `ind[0]` is not 0, `ind[0] - 1` will be a valid integer. Also, `ind[1] - ind[0]` will be a positive integer because `ind[1] > ind[0]`.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, where `ind` is a list of two indices such that `ind[0] < ind[1]` and `ind[0]` is not 0.**
