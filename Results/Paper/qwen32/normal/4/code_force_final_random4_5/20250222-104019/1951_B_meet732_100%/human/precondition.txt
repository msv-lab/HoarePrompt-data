a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, k, ratings). n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) is the number of cows, k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) is the index of the cow you own, and ratings is a list of n distinct integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The length of the list a is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which is the number of test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
