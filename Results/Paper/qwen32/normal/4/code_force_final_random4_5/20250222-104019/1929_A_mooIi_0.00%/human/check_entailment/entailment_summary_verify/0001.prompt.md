You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and prints them in ascending order as a space-separated string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided Python program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to rearrange the elements of the array in such a way that the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) from i=2 to n is maximized. To achieve this, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. However, the given program sorts the array and then prints the sorted array as a string, which is not the required output. The program should calculate the maximum beauty of the array based on the sorted order and print that value instead.

The correct approach would be:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   a. Read the length of the array.
   b. Read the array elements.
   c. Sort the array.
   d. Calculate the beauty of the array as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   e. Print the calculated beauty.

The given program does not perform these steps correctly and instead prints the sorted array elements as a string, which is not the expected output.

Correctness: **False**
