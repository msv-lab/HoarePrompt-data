To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `ar` is a map object containing sorted string integers from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

### Analysis:
- `ar` is described as a map object containing sorted string integers. This implies that `ar` is an iterable of strings, each representing an integer, and these strings are sorted in ascending order.
- The `join` method concatenates the elements of the iterable `ar` into a single string, with each element separated by a space (' ').

### Output:
Since `ar` is a map object of sorted string integers, the `print` statement will output these string integers joined by spaces. The exact integers depend on the input, but they will be sorted in ascending order.

### Example:
If the input integers were `[3, 1, 2]`, then `ar` would be a map object containing the sorted strings `['1', '2', '3']`. The `print` statement would output:
```
1 2 3
```

### General Output Description:
The output will be a space-separated string of the sorted input integers, each converted to a string.

### Final Answer:
Output: **a space-separated string of sorted input integers (where each integer is converted to a string)**
