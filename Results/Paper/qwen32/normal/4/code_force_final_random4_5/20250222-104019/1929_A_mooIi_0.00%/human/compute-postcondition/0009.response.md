The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided by the input. The initial state specifies that `n` is `n - 1`, which means `n` was previously decremented by 1. After executing the code, `n` will take on a new value based on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` is the integer provided by the input; `ar` is a map object containing sorted string integers from the input.**

In simpler terms, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is now the integer value entered by the user, and `ar` remains unchanged as well.
