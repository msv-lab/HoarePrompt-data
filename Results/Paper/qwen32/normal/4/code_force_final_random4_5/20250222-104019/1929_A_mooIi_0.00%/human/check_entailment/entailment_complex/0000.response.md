Reasoning:
The provided program does not actually solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n after rearranging the elements of the array to maximize this sum. The correct approach to maximize the beauty is to sort the array in ascending order and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the program provided sorts the array and prints it without calculating the beauty. Hence, the program is not performing the required computation to determine the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**
