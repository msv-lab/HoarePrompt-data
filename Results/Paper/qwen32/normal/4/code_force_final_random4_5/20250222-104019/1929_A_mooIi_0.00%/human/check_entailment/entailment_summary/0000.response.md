Reasoning:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to determine the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the optimal arrangement of the array elements is to sort them in ascending order. However, the program only sorts the array and prints it, without calculating the beauty of the array.

To solve the problem correctly, after sorting the array, the program should calculate the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Since the program does not perform the necessary calculation to determine the beauty, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
