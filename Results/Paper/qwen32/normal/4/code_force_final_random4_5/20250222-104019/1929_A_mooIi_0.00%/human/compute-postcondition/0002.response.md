The code snippet takes an input string of integers, splits it into individual integer values, sorts these integers, converts them back to strings, and maps them to a variable `ar`. Therefore, `ar` will hold a map object of sorted string integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a map object containing sorted string integers from the input.**
