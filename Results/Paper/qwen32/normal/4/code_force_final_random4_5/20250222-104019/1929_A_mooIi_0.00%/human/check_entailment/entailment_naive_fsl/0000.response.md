Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted array elements, which is not the expected output.

The problem requires rearranging the array elements to maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this beauty, the optimal approach is to sort the array and then calculate the beauty using the sorted array.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += ar[i] - ar[i-1]
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.
