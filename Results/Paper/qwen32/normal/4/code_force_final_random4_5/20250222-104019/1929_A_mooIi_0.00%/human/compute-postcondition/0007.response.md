Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
2. `n` is a new input integer.
3. `ar` is a map object containing sorted string integers from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

### Analysis:
- `ar` is a map object that contains sorted string integers. This means that `ar` is an iterable containing string representations of integers that have been sorted.
- The `join` method is used to concatenate the elements of the iterable `ar` into a single string, with each element separated by a space.

### Output:
The output will be a string where all the sorted string integers from `ar` are concatenated with a space between each element.

Since the exact contents of `ar` are not provided, we can't specify the exact numerical values. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **a space-separated string of sorted string integers from `ar` (where `ar` is a map object containing sorted string integers from the input)**
