The given `print` statement is `print('YES')`. This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, or `i` as described in the initial state.

Here is the breakdown of the reasoning:

- The initial state describes several conditions and relationships between variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i`.
- However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
