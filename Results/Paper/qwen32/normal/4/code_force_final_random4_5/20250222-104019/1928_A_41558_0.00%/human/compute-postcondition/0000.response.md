The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers within the range 1 to 10^9. The execution of the code affects only the variable `n`, as it is assigned the value of the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**
