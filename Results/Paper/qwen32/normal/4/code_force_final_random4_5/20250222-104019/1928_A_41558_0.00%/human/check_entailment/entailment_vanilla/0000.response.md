Let's analyze the correctness of the given program step-by-step based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the original rectangle's sides. Then, he wants to form a new rectangle using the two smaller rectangles. The new rectangle must be different from the original one, considering that rotations of the same rectangle are considered identical.

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to its length, he gets two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) (if \(b\) is even) or \(a \times \left(\frac{b-1}{2}\right)\) and \(a \times \left(\frac{b+1}{2}\right)\) (if \(b\) is odd).
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to its width, he gets two rectangles of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) (if \(a\) is even) or \(\left(\frac{a-1}{2}\right) \times b\) and \(\left(\frac{a+1}{2}\right) \times b\) (if \(a\) is odd).

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, cutting will result in two rectangles of different sizes, but when combined, they can only form a rectangle of the same dimensions as the original. Thus, it's impossible to form a different rectangle.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) (but not both) is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle by combining the two smaller rectangles in a different configuration.
   - If \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\), the two smaller rectangles formed will be of size \(a \times b/2\) or \(a/2 \times b\), which can only form a rectangle of the same dimensions as the original. Thus, it's impossible to form a different rectangle.
   - In all other cases, Bob can form a new rectangle by arranging the smaller rectangles in a different configuration.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

- **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` This correctly identifies the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, and in this case, Bob cannot form a different rectangle.
- **Condition 2:** `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` This correctly identifies the cases where one dimension is exactly twice the other, and in these cases, Bob cannot form a different rectangle.
- **Else Case:** For all other cases, the program outputs "YES", which is correct because Bob can always form a different rectangle.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
