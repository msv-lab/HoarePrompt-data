The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 2`.

The states of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `n` should remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, no further changes are made to `a` or `b`. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, then either `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`. Otherwise, neither `a` is half of `b` nor `b` is half of `a`. `i` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
