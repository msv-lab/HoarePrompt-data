Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Handling of Odd Dimensions**: The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` is correct for the case where both dimensions are odd, as such a rectangle cannot be rearranged into a different rectangle after a cut. However, the subsequent condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect and unnecessary.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Even Dimensions**: The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is not the correct way to determine if another rectangle can be formed. This condition checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, which is not relevant to the problem. Instead, the program should check if at least one of the dimensions is even, because if either dimension is even, the rectangle can be cut and rearranged into a different rectangle.

3. **General Logic**: The correct logic should be:
   - If both dimensions are odd, print "NO".
   - Otherwise, print "YES".

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This program correctly checks if both dimensions are odd and prints "NO" in that case, and "YES" otherwise.
