The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. The conditions related to the parity of `a` and `b` and their relationship (whether one is twice the other) remain unchanged by this line of code.

The new values for `a` and `b` are determined by the input, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
