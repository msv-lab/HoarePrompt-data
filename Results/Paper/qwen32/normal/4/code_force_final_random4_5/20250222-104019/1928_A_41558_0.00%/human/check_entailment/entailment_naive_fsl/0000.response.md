Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. Let's analyze the logic in the code:

1. The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If they are, it prints "NO", which is correct because an odd by odd rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
2. The program then checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". This is incorrect because these conditions do not cover all cases where a new rectangle cannot be formed. For example, a 4x3 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 4x3 rectangle.
3. If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "YES", which is not always correct.

Let's consider a counterexample:
- For a rectangle of size 4x3, the program will print "YES" because neither `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` nor `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is true. However, this is incorrect because the 4x3 rectangle can indeed be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle, which is a different rectangle.

Another counterexample:
- For a rectangle of size 6x2, the program will print "YES" because neither `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` nor `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is true. However, this is incorrect because the 6x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x2 rectangles and rearranged to form a 2x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original 6x2 rectangle when considering rotations.

The correct logic should be:
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, print "NO".
- Otherwise, print "YES" because the rectangle can always be cut and rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The correct implementation would be:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

This implementation correctly handles all cases according to the problem description.
