### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic provided in the program and compare it with the problem description.

1. **Case 1: Both `a` and `b` are odd**
   - If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle because cutting the rectangle will always result in two rectangles with at least one odd dimension, and these cannot be rearranged into a new rectangle with integer sides.
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd.

2. **Case 2: One dimension is twice the other**
   - If one dimension is exactly twice the other (e.g., `a = 2b` or `b = 2a`), Bob can only form rectangles of the same dimensions as the original rectangle after cutting and rearranging.
   - For example, a `4x2` rectangle can be cut into two `2x2` rectangles, which can only be rearranged into a `4x2` rectangle.
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing 'NO' if one of the dimensions is exactly twice the other.

3. **Case 3: All other cases**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, Bob can form a different rectangle.
   - For example, a `6x2` rectangle can be cut into two `3x2` rectangles, which can be rearranged into a `4x3` rectangle.
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing 'YES' for all other cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the given rectangle dimensions.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
