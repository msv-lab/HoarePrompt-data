The code `a = input().split()` takes an input string, splits it by spaces, and assigns the resulting list of strings to the variable `a`. Given that `a` was initially a list of integers, after this operation, `a` will be a list of strings. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` strings, each representing an integer.**
