Output State: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` if `l` is 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 2` if `l` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 3 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is 2 if `a[l]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 2 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `k` is decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`. If `a[l]` was 0, then `a[l]` is 0. The current value of `a[r]` is 0 if `a[r]` was 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is `k % 2`. `t` is `k % 2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. All other variables retain their previously defined states and values.
