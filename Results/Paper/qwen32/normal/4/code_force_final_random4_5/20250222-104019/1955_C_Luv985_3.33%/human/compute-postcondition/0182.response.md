Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`. `T` is 0, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. If `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r]` (which is `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]`) is 0, then `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `l` is 1, and `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `r` remains `n - 1`, `l` remains 0, and `ans` is 2 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, or 1 otherwise. `t` is `k % 2`.**
