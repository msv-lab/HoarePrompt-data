Initial State: `l` is 1 if it was 0, or `l` is 2 if it was 1; `r` is `n - 2` if `l` is 1, otherwise `r` is `n - 3` if `l` is 2; `k` is greater than `mi * 2`; `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`; `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`; `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.

After the code `k -= mi * 2` is executed, the value of `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`.

Output State: **`l` is 1 if it was 0, or `l` is 2 if it was 1; `r` is `n - 2` if `l` is 1, otherwise `r` is `n - 3` if `l` is 2; `k` is greater than `mi * 2` minus `mi * 2` (i.e., `k` is greater than 0); `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`; `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`; `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**
