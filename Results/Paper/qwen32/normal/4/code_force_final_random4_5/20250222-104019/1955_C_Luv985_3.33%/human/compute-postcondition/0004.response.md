The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`. Since `input().split()` returns a list of strings, `n` and `k` will be strings representing integers. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers, so after the assignment, `n` and `k` will still represent integers but will be in string form.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are strings representing integers such that 1 <= int(`n`) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= int(`k`) <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for each i. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
