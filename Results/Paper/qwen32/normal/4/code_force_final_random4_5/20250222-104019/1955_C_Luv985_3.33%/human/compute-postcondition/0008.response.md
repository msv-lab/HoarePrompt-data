The code snippet converts each element of the list `a` from a string to an integer. Therefore, the list `a` will now hold integer values instead of strings. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers.**
