The code snippet initializes a variable `ans` with the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. This operation does not affect any of the other variables provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` is the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i`; `suff` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`; `ans` is `float('inf')`.**
