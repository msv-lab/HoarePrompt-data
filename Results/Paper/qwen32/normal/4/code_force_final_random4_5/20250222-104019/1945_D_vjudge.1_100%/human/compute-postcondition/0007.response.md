Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` is the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i`; `suff` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`; `i` is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `suff[i]` has been updated to be `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or have been previously defined as per the initial state. The value of `i` has been decremented by 1.
