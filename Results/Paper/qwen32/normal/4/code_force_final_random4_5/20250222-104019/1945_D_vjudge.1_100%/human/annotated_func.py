#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates and prints the minimum value of the sums `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` from index `i` to the end of the lists.
