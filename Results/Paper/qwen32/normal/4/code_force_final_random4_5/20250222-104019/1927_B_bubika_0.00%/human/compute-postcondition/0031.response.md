The code snippet `b[x] += 1` increments the value of `b[x]` by 1. Given the initial state, `b` already has incremented values at those indices with `b[x]` increased by 1. Therefore, this operation will further increment `b[x]` by 1.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`r` is `2 * a[x]`, `b` has incremented values at those indices with `b[x]` increased by 2, `t` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `i` is the next element in `s`.**

In natural language, the value of `b[x]` has been increased by an additional 1, making the total increment of `b[x]` by 2. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
