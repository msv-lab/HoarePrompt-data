To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code `r += a[x]` on the variables. Given the initial state, `r` is an empty string, and `x` is the index of `i` in `b`. However, `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we must assume that `a` is a list or a string from which characters or elements are being accessed.

Since `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, and `a[x]` is being appended to `r`, the new value of `r` will be the character or element at index `x` in `a`.

Given that the initial state of `r` is an empty string, after the operation, `r` will hold the value of `a[x]`.

The other variables (`b`, `t`, `n`, `s`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`r` is `a[x]`, `b` has incremented values at the indices corresponding to the elements in `s`, `t` is `X + len(s)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.**
