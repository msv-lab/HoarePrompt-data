The value of `x` is decreased by `2 ** (i - 1)`. Given `i` is 61, `2 ** (i - 1)` is `2 ** 60`. Therefore, `x` is reduced by `2 ** 60`. The values of `t`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged. Since `x` was initially equal to `t`, `x` is now `t - 2 ** 60`.

Output State: **The input consists of a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, where `t` is equal to `x + 2 ** 60`. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}) representing the number of increasing subsequences required for that test case. `subseq_lens` is [60]. `mx` is 0. `i` is 61. `x` is `t - 2 ** 60`.**
