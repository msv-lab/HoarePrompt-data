The code snippet provided is `mx = max(mx, i - 1)`. This line updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i - 1`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `mx` or `i`, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables.

Given the initial state that `t` is equal to `x + 2`, this information is not directly relevant to the calculation of `mx` in the provided code snippet. Therefore, we will focus on the relationship between `mx` and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is equal to `x + 2`; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1`.**
