### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to generate an array such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The approach taken in the program is based on the idea of representing \( X \) as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Each power of 2 corresponds to a unique increasing subsequence length. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its logic and correctness:

1. **Handling \( X = 2 \)**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( X = 2 \). It outputs an array of length 1 with a single element (0). This is correct because an array with a single element has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.

2. **Decomposition of \( X \) into Powers of 2**:
   - For \( X \neq 2 \), the program attempts to decompose \( X \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is done by repeatedly finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \), subtracting it from \( X \), and storing the exponent in the `subseq_lens` list.
   - This decomposition is correct mathematically, as any positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (binary representation).

3. **Constructing the Array**:
   - After decomposing \( X \), the program constructs an array `ansv` that consists of integers from 0 to `mx - 1` followed by the remaining elements of `subseq_lens` (from index 1 to the end).
   - The array `ansv` is designed such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences in this array is the sum of the number of subsequences of length corresponding to each element in `subseq_lens`. Since each element in `subseq_lens` is unique and corresponds to a distinct power of 2, this sum is exactly \( X \).

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the length of the array and the array itself. The output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to find an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. It handles all edge cases and correctly constructs the required array based on the decomposition of \( X \) into powers of 2.

**Correctness: True**
