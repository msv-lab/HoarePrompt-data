Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a sequence of integers based on the powers of 2 that sum up to the given number of increasing subsequences `X`. However, there are several issues with the approach and the implementation:

1. **Binary Representation**: The program tries to use the binary representation of `X` to construct the sequence. While it correctly identifies the powers of 2 that sum up to `X`, this does not guarantee that the constructed sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Construction of the Array**: The program constructs the array `ansv` by appending integers from 0 to `mx-1` and then appending the exponents from the binary representation of `X`. However, this construction does not ensure that the resulting array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The problem requires a specific construction of the array where the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case where `X` is 2 by printing an array of length 1 with a single element 0. However, for other values of `X`, the constructed array may not meet the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, which is correct according to the problem statement. However, the content of the array is not guaranteed to be correct.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all values of `X`.

Correctness: **False**
