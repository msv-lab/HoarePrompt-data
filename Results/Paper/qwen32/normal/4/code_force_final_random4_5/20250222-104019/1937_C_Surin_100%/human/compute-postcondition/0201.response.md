To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved in the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`
- `i` is incremented by 1

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: The initial state mentions that `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the value of `i` in the print statement is the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.
2. **`v1`**: The initial state does not provide any information about the value of `v1`. Therefore, we can only refer to it as `v1`.
3. **`prev`**: The initial state does not provide any information about the value of `prev`. Therefore, we can only refer to it as `prev`.

### Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string with the values of `v1`, `i` (after increment), `v1` again, and `prev`.

Given the lack of specific values for `v1` and `prev`, the output will be described in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [v1] [i (after increment)] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the value of v1, i (after increment) is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1, and prev is the value of prev)**
