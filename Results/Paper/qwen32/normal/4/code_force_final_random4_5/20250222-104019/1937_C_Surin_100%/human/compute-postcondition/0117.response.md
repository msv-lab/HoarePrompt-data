The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `v1` (the largest integer `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the user's response was `'<'`), and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `v1 + 1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `v1`. If `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the user's input to the new `input('')` prompt, and `prev` is set to `v1` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. `kp` is unchanged, `i` is `v1 + 1`**
