The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. Given that `v1` is defined as the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, it follows that `i` must be equal to `v1` at this point in the code.

Therefore, the value of `prev` is updated to be equal to `v1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is `v1`, `kp` is unchanged, `r` is `'='`, `r2` is `'<'`.**
