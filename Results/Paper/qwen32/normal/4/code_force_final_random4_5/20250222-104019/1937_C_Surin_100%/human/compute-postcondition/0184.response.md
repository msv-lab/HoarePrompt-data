Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the user's input, and the current value of `r2` is `'<'`.**

Explanation: The value of `prev` is updated to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
