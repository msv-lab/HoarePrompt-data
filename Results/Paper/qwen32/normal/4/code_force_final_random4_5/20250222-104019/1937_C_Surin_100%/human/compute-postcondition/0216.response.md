Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, the function can ask up to 3n queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs (p_a, p_b) and (p_c, p_d). The function determines the indices i and j that maximize the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j, and outputs "! i j".**
