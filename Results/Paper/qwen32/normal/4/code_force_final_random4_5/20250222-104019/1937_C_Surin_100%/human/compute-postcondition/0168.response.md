The variable `v1` is assigned the value of `v2`. The values of `n`, `i`, `v2`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 2, `v2` is equal to `i`, `r` is the user's input as a string, `v1` is equal to `v2`.**
