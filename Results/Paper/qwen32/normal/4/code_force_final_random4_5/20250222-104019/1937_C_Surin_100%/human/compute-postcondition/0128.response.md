Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than `v1 + 1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `kp` is unchanged, `i` is `v1 + 1`, `r` is the user's input. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `v1 + 1`. If `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the user's input, and if `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is set to `v1 + 1`. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**
