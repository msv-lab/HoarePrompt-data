To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop evolves over time:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - In each iteration, `v2` is set to the current value of `i`.
   - The program prints a formatted string and waits for user input.
   - Depending on the user input (`r`), `v1` is updated to `v2` if `r` is `'<'`.

3. **Final State**:
   - The loop will execute `n-1` times.
   - After `n-1` iterations, `i` will have taken all values from 1 to `n-1`.
   - `v1` will be the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'`.

Given this understanding, the final state of the variables will be:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `g` remains 0.
- `v1` will be the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`.**

In simpler terms, `v1` will be the highest index for which the user indicated that a certain condition was met by responding with `'<'`.
