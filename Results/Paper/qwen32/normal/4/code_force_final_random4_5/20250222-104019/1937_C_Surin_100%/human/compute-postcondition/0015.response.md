The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Given that `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous state, `v2` will now hold the value of `i` after this increment. The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i`, `g` is 0, `v1` is equal to `i` - 1, `r` is the user input string, `i` is incremented by 1, `v2` is equal to `i`.**
