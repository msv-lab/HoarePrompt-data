The code assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. Since `i` is `v1 + 1`, `prev` now holds the value of `v1 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `r` is the user's input, `prev` is `v1 + 1`, `i` is `v1 + 1`, `r2` is the new user's input.**
