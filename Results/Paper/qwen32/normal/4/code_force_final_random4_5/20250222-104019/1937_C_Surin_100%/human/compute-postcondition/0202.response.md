The given Python code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all the data written to the standard output (stdout) is actually sent out. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state: `n` is greater than `i+1`, and `i` is incremented by 1, the value of `i` has already been updated before the `sys.stdout.flush()` statement is executed. Therefore, the state of `i` and `n` remains as described in the initial state, and no further changes occur to these variables due to the `sys.stdout.flush()` statement.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1**
