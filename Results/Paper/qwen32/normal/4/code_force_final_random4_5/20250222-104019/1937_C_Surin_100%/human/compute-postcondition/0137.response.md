The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. Given that `i` is `v1 + 2`, after this assignment, `prev` will also hold the value `v1 + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `v1 + 2`, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `kp` is unchanged, `i` is `v1 + 2`, `r` is the user's new input, `prev` is `v1 + 2`, `r2` is the user's input.**
