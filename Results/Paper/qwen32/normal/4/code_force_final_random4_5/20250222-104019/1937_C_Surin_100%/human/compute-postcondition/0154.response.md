The value of `v1` is updated to be equal to `v2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `prev` is the largest `i` for which the user input was `'>'` or `'='` and the subsequent comparison with `prev` resulted in `'<'`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is an input string, and `r` equals `'<'`.**
