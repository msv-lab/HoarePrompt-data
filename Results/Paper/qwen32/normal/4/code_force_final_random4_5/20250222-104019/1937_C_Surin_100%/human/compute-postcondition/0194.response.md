The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the output device. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value still holds. The variable `r` retains the value obtained from `input()`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `r` is the value of `input()`**.
