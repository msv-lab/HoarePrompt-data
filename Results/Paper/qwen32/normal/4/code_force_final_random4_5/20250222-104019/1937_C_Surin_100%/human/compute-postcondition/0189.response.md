To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

Initial State: 
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

From the given initial state, we know:
- `n` is a value greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but the previous value of `i` is not specified.
- `v1` and `prev` are not defined in the initial state provided, so we need to assume they have some values that were set earlier in the code.

Since `v1` and `prev` are not defined in the initial state, we can't determine their exact values. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

The output will be a formatted string that includes:
- A literal question mark `?`
- The value of `v1`
- The value of `i` (which is incremented by 1 from its previous value)
- The value of `v1` again
- The value of `prev`

Given the lack of specific values for `v1` and `prev`, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where v1 and prev are the values of the variables v1 and prev respectively, and i is the value of i incremented by 1 from its previous value)**
