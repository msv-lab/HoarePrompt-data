The code assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Given the initial state, `i` is `v1 + 2`, so `prev` will now hold the value `v1 + 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `v1 + 2`, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `kp` is unchanged, `i` is `v1 + 2`, `r` is the user's new input, `prev` is `v1 + 2`.**
