The code `r2 = input('')` takes a new user input and assigns it to the variable `r2`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `g`, `v1`, `r`, `prev`, or `i`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `r2` with the value of the user's new input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `r` is the user's input, `prev` is `v1 + 1`, `i` is `v1 + 2`, `r2` is the user's new input.**
