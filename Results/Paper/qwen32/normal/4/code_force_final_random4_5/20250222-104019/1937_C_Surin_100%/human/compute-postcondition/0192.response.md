Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `r` is the value of `input()`, `prev` is equal to the incremented value of `i`.**

In simple terms: `n` remains greater than 1, `i` has been incremented by 1, `r` holds the value from `input()`, and `prev` now holds the same value as the incremented `i`.
