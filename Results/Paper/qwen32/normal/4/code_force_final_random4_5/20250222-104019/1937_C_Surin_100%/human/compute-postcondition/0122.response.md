Let's break down the given initial state and determine the values of the variables that will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` must be greater than `v1 + 1`.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`.
- `r` is the user's input.
- If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `v1`.
- If `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the user's input to the new `input('')` prompt, and `prev` is set to `v1` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0.
- `kp` is unchanged.
- `i` is `v1 + 1`.
- `r` is the user's input.

### Analysis:
- `i` is explicitly defined as `v1 + 1`.
- `prev` depends on the user's responses:
  - If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is `v1`.
  - If `r` is `'='`, `prev` depends on the subsequent input `r2`:
    - If `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is `v1`.
    - Otherwise, `prev` is `0`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Determining the Output:
- The first `{i}` and the second `{i}` in the format string will both be `v1 + 1`.
- The value of `prev` depends on the user's responses, so we need to consider the two cases:
  - If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is `v1`.
  - If `r` is `'='`, `prev` is `v1` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` is `0`.

### Output:
Since the exact user responses (`r` and `r2`) are not provided, we need to describe the output based on the possible values of `prev`:

- If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is `v1`.
- If `r` is `'='`, `prev` is `v1` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` is `0`.

Thus, the output will be one of the following:
- If `r` is `'>'`: Output: **? v1+1 v1+1 v1 v1**
- If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`: Output: **? v1+1 v1+1 v1 v1**
- If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is not `'<'`: Output: **? v1+1 v1+1 0 0**

Given the information, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? v1+1 v1+1 prev prev (where prev is v1 if r is '>' or if r is '=' and r2 is '<', otherwise prev is 0)**
