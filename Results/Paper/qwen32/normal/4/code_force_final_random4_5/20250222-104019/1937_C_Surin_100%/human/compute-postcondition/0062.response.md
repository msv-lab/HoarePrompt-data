The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. Given that `i` is `v1 + 2`, the value of `prev` will now be `v1 + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `r` is the user's input, `prev` is `v1 + 2`, `i` is `v1 + 2`.**
