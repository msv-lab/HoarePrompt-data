The code snippet `prev = 0` sets the variable `prev` to 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `kp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the new integer input by the user, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`.**
