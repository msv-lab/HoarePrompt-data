The code snippet `r2 = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r2`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, and `r`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is 0, `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the user's input.**
