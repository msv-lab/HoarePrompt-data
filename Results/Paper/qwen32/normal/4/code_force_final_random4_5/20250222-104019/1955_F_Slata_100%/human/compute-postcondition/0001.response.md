The code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The initial state specifies that `p_i` (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) represents the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively, and `i` is 0. After the code execution, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will be updated to the integers provided in the input, and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the four integers read from the input; `i` is 0.**
