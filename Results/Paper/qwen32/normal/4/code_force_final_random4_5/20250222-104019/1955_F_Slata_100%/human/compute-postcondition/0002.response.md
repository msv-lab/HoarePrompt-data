To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression:

The print statement is:
```python
print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

### Breakdown of the Expression

1. **Integer Division (`//`)**:
   - `a // 2`: This operation divides `a` by 2 and takes the integer part of the result (i.e., it performs floor division).
   - `b // 2`: Similarly, this divides `b` by 2 and takes the integer part.
   - `c // 2`: This divides `c` by 2 and takes the integer part.
   - `d // 2`: This divides `d` by 2 and takes the integer part.

2. **Modulo Operation (`%`)**:
   - `a % 2`: This operation gives the remainder when `a` is divided by 2. The result will be either 0 (if `a` is even) or 1 (if `a` is odd).
   - `b % 2`: Similarly, this gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 2.
   - `c % 2`: This gives the remainder when `c` is divided by 2.
   - `d % 2`: This gives the remainder when `d` is divided by 2.

3. **Sum of Remainders**:
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2`: This sums the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2. The possible sums are 0, 1, 2, or 3.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` is exactly 3. If it is, the result is 1 (True), otherwise, it is 0 (False).

### Putting It All Together

The final expression to be printed is:
\[ a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + \text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3) \]

This expression calculates the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, and adds 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2 is exactly 3.

### Output Description

The output will be the calculated value of the above expression. Given that the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **The sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2 is exactly 3.**
