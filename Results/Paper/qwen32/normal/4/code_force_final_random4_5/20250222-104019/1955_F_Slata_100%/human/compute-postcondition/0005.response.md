To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression step by step:

The print statement is:
```python
print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

1. **Integer Division (`//`)**:
   - `a // 2` will give the integer part of the division of `a` by 2.
   - `b // 2` will give the integer part of the division of `b` by 2.
   - `c // 2` will give the integer part of the division of `c` by 2.
   - `d // 2` will give the integer part of the division of `d` by 2.

2. **Modulo Operation (`%`)**:
   - `a % 2` will give the remainder when `a` is divided by 2 (either 0 or 1).
   - `b % 2` will give the remainder when `b` is divided by 2 (either 0 or 1).
   - `c % 2` will give the remainder when `c` is divided by 2 (either 0 or 1).

3. **Sum of Modulo Results**:
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2` will give a sum that can range from 0 to 3, depending on how many of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` will be `1` if all three of `a % 2`, `b % 2`, and `c % 2` are 1 (i.e., all three are odd), and `0` otherwise.

5. **Combining the Results**:
   - The final expression sums up the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, and adds `1` if all three of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd.

Since `d` is not involved in the condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`, the value of `d % 2` does not affect the result of the condition check.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus `1` if all three of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd.

Output: **a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)**
