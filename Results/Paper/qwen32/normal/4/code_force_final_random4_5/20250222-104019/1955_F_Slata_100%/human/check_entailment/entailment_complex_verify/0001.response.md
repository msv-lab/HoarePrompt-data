### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Description Recap
- **Game Rules**: Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
- **Eve's Role**: Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.
- **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case.

#### Program Analysis
The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
1. Counting the number of pairs for each number (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`).
2. Checking if there are exactly three odd counts (`a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`). If so, it adds one more to the count of Bob's wins.

#### XOR Properties
- XOR of two identical numbers is zero.
- XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
- XOR is commutative and associative.

#### Strategy Breakdown
- If the count of a number is even, it can be paired up to produce zeros.
- If the count of a number is odd, one number will remain unpaired.
- The XOR of the sequence will be zero if:
  - All counts are even.
  - All counts are even except one is odd.

#### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the given examples:

1. **Input**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
   - Odd counts: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (add 1)
   - Output: `1`
   - **Explanation**: There are three odd counts, so the XOR of the sequence is zero. Bob wins once.

2. **Input**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Odd counts: `1 + 0 + 1 = 2` (do not add 1)
   - Output: `1`
   - **Explanation**: There are two odd counts, so the XOR of the sequence is non-zero. Bob wins once.

3. **Input**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Odd counts: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (do not add 1)
   - Output: `3`
   - **Explanation**: All counts are even, so the XOR of the sequence is zero. Bob wins three times.

4. **Input**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Odd counts: `1 + 1 + 0 = 2` (do not add 1)
   - Output: `3`
   - **Explanation**: There are two odd counts, so the XOR of the sequence is non-zero. Bob wins three times.

5. **Input**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Pairs: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
   - Odd counts: `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (add 1)
   - Output: `12`
   - **Explanation**: There are three odd counts, so the XOR of the sequence is zero. Bob wins twelve times.

#### Annotations Analysis
The annotations describe the program's state at key points:
- The sum of the computed values from each iteration, where each computed value is determined by the formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` for each set of input values `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

The annotations align with the logic described in the original assessment.

#### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
