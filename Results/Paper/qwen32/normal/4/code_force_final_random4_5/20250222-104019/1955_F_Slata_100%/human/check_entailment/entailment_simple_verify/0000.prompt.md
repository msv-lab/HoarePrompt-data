You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: The sum of the computed values from each iteration, where each computed value is determined by the formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` for each set of input values `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Let's analyze why:

The program calculates the number of pairs of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) and then checks if there is an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s left after pairing. If there are exactly three odd counts, it adds 1 to the result. This logic is not sufficient to determine the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero as many times as possible. This involves more complex logic than just pairing numbers and checking the odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
2 0 0 0
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
- Initially, the sequence is [1, 1]. The XOR of [1, 1] is 0, so Bob wins.
- Eve removes one 1, leaving [1]. The XOR of [1] is 1, so Alice wins.
- Eve removes the last 1, leaving an empty sequence. The game ends.

However, the program would output `0` for this input because there are no pairs and the condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` is not met.

To correctly solve this problem, Eve should consider the parity of the counts of each number and strategically remove elements to maximize the number of times the XOR becomes zero. The provided program does not handle this correctly.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
