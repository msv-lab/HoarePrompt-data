To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic behind the formula used in the program and see if it aligns with the problem description. The problem states that Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero. The key is to understand how the removal of numbers can lead to a situation where the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

### Analysis:

1. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0 (e.g., 1 XOR 1 = 0).
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., 1 XOR 0 = 1).
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Understanding the Formula**:
   - The formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the maximum number of pairs that can be made from each type of number. Each pair will result in a zero when XORed.
   - The term `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` is an additional check to see if there is exactly one number left of each type (1, 2, 3) after pairing. If so, the XOR of these three numbers will be zero (since 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0).

3. **Why the Formula Works**:
   - By maximizing the number of pairs, we minimize the number of numbers left over.
   - If there are exactly three numbers left (one of each type 1, 2, 3), their XOR will be zero, allowing Bob to win.
   - The formula thus calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by optimally removing numbers to leave a sequence with a zero XOR.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the formula with the provided examples:

- **Example 1: 1 1 1 0**
  - Pairs: 0 (since there are no pairs)
  - Leftover: 1 1 1 (1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1, Bob cannot win initially)
  - Maximum Bob wins = 1 (by removing one number, leaving 1 1, XOR = 0)

- **Example 2: 1 0 1 2**
  - Pairs: 1 (one pair of 2s)
  - Leftover: 1 1 (1 XOR 1 = 0, Bob wins initially)
  - Maximum Bob wins = 1

- **Example 3: 2 2 2 0**
  - Pairs: 3 (one pair of each 1, 2, 3)
  - Leftover: None (All numbers paired, no XOR possible)
  - Maximum Bob wins = 3

- **Example 4: 3 3 2 0**
  - Pairs: 2 (one pair of 1s, one pair of 2s)
  - Leftover: 1 1 2 (1 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 2, Bob cannot win initially)
  - Maximum Bob wins = 3 (by removing one number, leaving 1 1 2, XOR = 0)

- **Example 5: 0 9 9 9**
  - Pairs: 9 (three pairs of 2s, 3s, 4s)
  - Leftover: 9 (All numbers paired, no XOR possible)
  - Maximum Bob wins = 12

### Conclusion:
The formula correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by optimally removing numbers to leave a sequence with a zero XOR. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
