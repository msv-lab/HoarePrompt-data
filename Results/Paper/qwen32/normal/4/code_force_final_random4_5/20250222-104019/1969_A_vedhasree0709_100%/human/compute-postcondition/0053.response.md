Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element of the list `l` at index `i`; `q` is the element of the list `l` at index `p - 1`; `j` is 1; `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `j` is 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
