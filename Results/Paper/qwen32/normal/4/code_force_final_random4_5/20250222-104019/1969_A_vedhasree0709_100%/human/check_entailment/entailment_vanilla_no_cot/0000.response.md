Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible cases. Specifically, the program only checks if there is a pair of friends who are best friends with each other and, if found, outputs 2. However, if no such pair is found, it incorrectly outputs 3 without considering other possible configurations that might require fewer than 3 invitations.

Here's an example where the program will give an incorrect result:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

While the output is correct for this specific case, the program does not handle all scenarios correctly. For instance:

**Input:**
```
1
5
2 3 4 5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

However, consider the following case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 1 4 3 6 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, the program should output 2 because friends 1 and 2 are best friends, and friends 3 and 4 are best friends, and friends 5 and 6 are best friends. Monocarp can invite just 2 friends (e.g., 1 and 3) to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party (1 and 2, and 3 and 4).

Thus, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.
