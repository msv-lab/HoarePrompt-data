The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` such that following the permutation defined by `p` starting from `i` leads back to `i` in exactly two steps. If such an index exists, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`.
