To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions and the behavior of the loop based on the given input states and the loop's code.

The loop continues to iterate as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. During each iteration, it checks if the value at `l[p - 1]` (where `p` is `l[i]`) equals `i + 1`. If this condition is met, it prints `2`, sets `j` to `1`, and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes all iterations without meeting the condition, `j` remains `0`.

Let's summarize the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `i` is `1`, `p` is the first element of `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`, and `j` remains `0` unless `q` equals `2`.
- After 2 iterations: `i` is `2`, `p` is the second element of `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`, and `j` remains `0` unless `q` equals `3`.
- After 3 iterations: `i` is `3`, `p` is the third element of `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`, and `j` remains `0` unless `q` equals `4`.

The loop will continue in this manner until `i` exceeds `n - 1`. If the loop completes all iterations without finding any `q` that equals `i + 1`, `j` will remain `0`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
- `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop condition `i <= n - 1` fails when `i` becomes `n`).
- `j` will be `1` if any `q` equals `i + 1` during any iteration, otherwise `j` will be `0`.
- `p` and `q` will be the values from the last iteration, but they are not part of the final output state as per the problem's requirements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `n`; `j` is `1` if any `q` equals `i + 1` during any iteration, otherwise `j` is `0`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `j` will be `1` if the condition `q == i + 1` was met at any point during the loop; otherwise, `j` will be `0`.
