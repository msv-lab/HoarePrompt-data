The code snippet `p = l[i]` updates the value of `p` to the element at index `i` of the list `l`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `p` will now hold the value of the second element of the list `l`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1 if `q` equals 2, otherwise `j` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is the element at index 1 of `l`, and `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of `l`.**
