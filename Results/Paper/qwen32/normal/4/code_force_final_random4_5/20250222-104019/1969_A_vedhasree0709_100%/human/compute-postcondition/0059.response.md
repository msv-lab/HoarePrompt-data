The `print(2)` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `q`, or `i` described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the integer `2`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print(2)` statement directly outputs the number `2`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
