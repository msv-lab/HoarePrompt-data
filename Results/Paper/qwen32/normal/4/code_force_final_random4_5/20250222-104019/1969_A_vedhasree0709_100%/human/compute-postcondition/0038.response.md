The code snippet provided is `j = 0`, which explicitly sets the value of `j` to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer value of the user's input; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.**
