The code snippet sets the variable `j` to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is the element at index 2 of `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of `l`.**
