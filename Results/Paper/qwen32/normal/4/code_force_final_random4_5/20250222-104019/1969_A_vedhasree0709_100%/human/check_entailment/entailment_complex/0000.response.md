### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., a cycle of length 2 in the permutation defined by the list `p`). If such a pair is found, it outputs `2` because inviting both friends in the pair will ensure that both attend the party. If no such pair is found, it defaults to outputting `3`.

However, this logic is not sufficient to guarantee the minimum number of invitations required in all cases. The program does not consider other possible configurations that might require only 2 invitations but do not form a cycle of length 2.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
3
3 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
3
2
3
```
But the correct output should be:
```
3
2
2
```
In the third test case (`n=3`, `p=[3, 2, 1]`), the friends can be paired as follows: friend 1's best friend is 3, and friend 3's best friend is 1. Friend 2's best friend is 2, which is not possible according to the problem constraints, but we can still consider the pairs (1,3) and (2,2). Since (2,2) is invalid, we consider (1,3). Inviting friends 1 and 2 will ensure that both 1 and 3 attend the party, so the correct answer is `2`.

The logic needs to be expanded to check for the smallest set of invitations that can ensure at least 2 friends attend, which is not just limited to cycles of length 2.

### Correctness:
**False**
