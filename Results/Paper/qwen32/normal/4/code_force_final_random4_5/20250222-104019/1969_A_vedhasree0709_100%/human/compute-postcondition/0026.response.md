Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element at index `n - 2` in `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`; `i` is `n - 2`; `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is explicitly set to 1 by the code. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
