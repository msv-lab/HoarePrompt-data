The code snippet assigns the value 0 to the variable `j`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the value of `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` remains an input integer, `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the input, and `i` remains 0. The only change is that `j` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**.
