The code snippet assigns the integer value `1` to the variable `j`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `q`, `i`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element of the list `l` at index `i`; `q` is the element of the list `l` at index `p - 1`; `i` must be less than `n - 1`; `j` is 1.**
