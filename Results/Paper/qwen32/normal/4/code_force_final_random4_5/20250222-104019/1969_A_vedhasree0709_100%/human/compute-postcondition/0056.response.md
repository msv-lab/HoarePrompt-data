The `while` loop condition is `i <= n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be such that the condition `i <= n - 1` holds true. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. This means that after the increment, `i` should still satisfy the condition `i <= n - 1` for the loop to continue.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be less than `n` before the increment. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` at the start of the next iteration.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to make sure that `i` is at most `n - 2` at the end of the previous iteration so that after incrementing, `i` becomes `n - 1` and the condition `i <= n - 1` still holds.

No other variables in the loop head (`n` in this case) need to be adjusted because `n` is already given to be at least 1 and does not change within the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element of the list `l` at index `i + 1`; `q` is the element of the list `l` at index `p - 1`; `i` must be less than `n - 1`**
