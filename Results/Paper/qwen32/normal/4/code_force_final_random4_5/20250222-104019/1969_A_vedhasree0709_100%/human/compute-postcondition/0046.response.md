Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the first element of the list `l`; `q` is the first element of the list `l`. If `q` is 1, then `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
