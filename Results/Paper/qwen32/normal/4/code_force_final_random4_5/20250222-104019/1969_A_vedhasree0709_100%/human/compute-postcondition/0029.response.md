The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element at index `n - 2` in `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`; `i` is `n - 1`. If `q` equals `i`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.
