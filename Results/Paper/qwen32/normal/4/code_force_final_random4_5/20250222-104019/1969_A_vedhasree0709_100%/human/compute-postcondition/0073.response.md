To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `i <= n - 1` is true when the loop starts. The variables involved in this condition are `i` and `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged (so `n` is some integer value)
- `l` is a new list of integers read from the input (not relevant to the loop condition)

The condition `i <= n - 1` needs to be satisfied. Since `i` is 0, the condition simplifies to `0 <= n - 1`, which means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `t` and `n` must be such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input**
