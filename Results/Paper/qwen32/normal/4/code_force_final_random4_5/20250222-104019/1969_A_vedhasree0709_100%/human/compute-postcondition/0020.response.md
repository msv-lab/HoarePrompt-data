Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element at index `i` in `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`; If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0; `i` must be less than `n - 1`.**
