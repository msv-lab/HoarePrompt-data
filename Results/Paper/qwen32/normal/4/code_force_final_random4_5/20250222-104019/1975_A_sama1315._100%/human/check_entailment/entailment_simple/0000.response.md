### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we split the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swap them. The provided program attempts to solve this by checking if any rotation of the array is sorted.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Concatenation**: The array `a` is concatenated with itself to form `concatenated_a`. This allows us to easily check for any rotation of the array.
2. **Sorting Check**: The program then checks every possible subarray of length `n` within `concatenated_a` to see if it matches the sorted version of the original array `a`.
3. **Return Result**: If any such subarray matches the sorted version, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

This approach is correct because:
- By concatenating the array with itself, we can simulate all possible rotations of the array.
- Checking each subarray of length `n` against the sorted version of `a` ensures that we are checking every possible rotation.
- If any rotation matches the sorted array, it means that the array can be sorted by performing the allowed operations.

Thus, the program correctly determines if the array can be sorted with the given operations.
