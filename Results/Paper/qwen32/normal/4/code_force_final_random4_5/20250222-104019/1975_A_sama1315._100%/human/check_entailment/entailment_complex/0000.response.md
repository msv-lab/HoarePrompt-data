### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into a prefix and a suffix, and then the two parts are swapped. The key insight here is that if you concatenate the array with itself, any possible rotation of the array will appear as a contiguous subsequence within this concatenated array. Therefore, the task reduces to checking if the sorted version of the array appears as a contiguous subsequence within the concatenated array.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Input:** A list `a` of `n` positive integers.
- **Process:** 
  - It first sorts the array and stores it in `sorted_a`.
  - It then creates a new array `concatenated_a` by concatenating `a` with itself.
  - The function then checks all possible contiguous subsequences of length `n` in `concatenated_a` to see if any of them match `sorted_a`.
- **Output:** Returns 'Yes' if a match is found, otherwise 'No'.
- **Correctness:** This function correctly implements the logic of checking if any rotation of the array can be sorted. By checking all possible subsequences of length `n` in the concatenated array, it ensures that all possible rotations are considered.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input:** Reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- **Process:** 
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
  - It calls `func_1` for each array `a` and stores the result.
- **Output:** Prints the results for all test cases, one per line.
- **Correctness:** This function correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each one using `func_1`. It reads the input correctly and formats the output as required.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work together to solve the problem as described. `func_1` performs the core logic of checking if the array can be sorted by any rotation, and `func_2` handles the input/output for multiple test cases. Since both functions are correctly implemented and work together as intended, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
