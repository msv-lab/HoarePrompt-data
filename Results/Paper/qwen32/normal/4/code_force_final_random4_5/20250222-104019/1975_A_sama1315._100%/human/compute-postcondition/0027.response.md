Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `1 + t * (1 + n_last)`, where `n_last` is the length of the last list `a` processed; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result` for each iteration; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` for the last iteration; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)` for the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `a` holds the last list of integers processed.
- `input` remains the function `sys.stdin.read`.
- `data` remains the list of strings obtained from the input.
- `idx` is adjusted to point just after the last list `a` was read from `data`.
- `t` remains the total number of iterations, which is greater than 0.
- `results` contains all the results from each call to `func_1(a)` for each iteration.
- `n` is the length of the last list `a` processed.
- `result` is the result of the last call to `func_1(a)`.
