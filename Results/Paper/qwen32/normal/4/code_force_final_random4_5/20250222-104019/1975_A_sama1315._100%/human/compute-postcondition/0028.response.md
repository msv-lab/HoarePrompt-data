To determine what will be printed by the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which the `results` list is populated.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`data`**: A list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`.
2. **`idx`**: Calculated as `1 + t * (1 + n_last)`, where `t` is an integer greater than 0, and `n_last` is the length of the last list `a` processed.
3. **`n`**: The integer value of `data[idx - 1]` for the last iteration.
4. **`a`**: A list of integers obtained by converting the strings from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers.
5. **`result`**: The value returned by `func_1(a)` for the last iteration.
6. **`results`**: A list containing the value of `result` for each iteration.

### Process:
- For each iteration, `idx` is recalculated based on the length of the previously processed list `a`.
- `n` is read from `data` at the position `idx - 1`.
- The list `a` is created by converting the next `n` strings from `data` to integers.
- The function `func_1(a)` is called with `a` as the argument, and the result is stored in `results`.

### Final Output:
The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will concatenate all elements in the `results` list with newline characters (`\n`) in between and print the resulting string.

### Explanation:
Since the specific values of `data`, `t`, `n_last`, and the results of `func_1(a)` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values in the `results` list. However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the problem.

### Output:
The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will print the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, each on a new line.

Output: **result_1\nresult_2\n...\nresult_k (where result_i is the value returned by func_1(a) for the i-th iteration)**
