You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we split the array into two parts and swap them. The key insight is that if the array can be sorted by such operations, then some rotation of the array should be the sorted version of the array. 

Here's how the provided program works:

1. **Concatenation Approach**: The function `func_1(a)` concatenates the array `a` with itself. This is done to simulate all possible rotations of the array `a` within a single array. For example, if `a = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, then `concatenated_a = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. 

2. **Checking for Sorted Subarray**: The program then checks if any subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (the original length of `a`) matches the sorted version of `a`. If it does, it means that some rotation of `a` is sorted, and thus, the answer is "Yes".

3. **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2()` reads multiple test cases from the input, processes each one using `func_1(a)`, and collects the results. Finally, it prints all the results.

### Correctness:

The approach is correct because:
- By concatenating the array with itself, we can check all possible rotations of the array in a single pass.
- If any rotation of the array matches the sorted array, then it is possible to sort the array using the allowed operations.

Therefore, the program should correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
