The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer value greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 so that it remains greater than 0.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 1; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**
