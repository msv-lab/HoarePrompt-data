Let's carefully analyze the program and the reasoning provided in the original assessment to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into a prefix and a suffix, and then the two parts are swapped. This operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1(a)`
- **Sorting and Concatenation**: The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`. It then creates a new array `concatenated_a` by concatenating `a` with itself.
- **Checking Subarrays**: The function iterates through possible starting points of subarrays within `concatenated_a` that have the same length as `a`. If any of these subarrays match `sorted_a`, it returns 'Yes'. If no such subarray is found, it returns 'No'.

#### Function `func_2()`
- **Input Handling**: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Evaluation
The logic of checking subarrays within the concatenated array is correct because it covers all possible rotations of the original array `a`. If any rotation of `a` can be sorted, it will appear as a subarray in `concatenated_a`. This is a valid approach to solve the problem.

However, let's consider the following points to ensure there are no edge cases missed:

1. **Edge Cases**: 
   - Arrays with identical elements: `[1, 1, 1]` should return 'Yes'.
   - Already sorted arrays: `[1, 2, 3]` should return 'Yes'.
   - Arrays that require a single rotation to be sorted: `[3, 1, 2]` should return 'Yes'.
   - Arrays that cannot be sorted by any rotation: `[3, 2, 1]` should return 'No'.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the logic of checking all possible rotations by concatenating the array with itself and checking subarrays of length `n`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases. The reasoning in the original assessment is accurate, and no known edge cases are missed.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
