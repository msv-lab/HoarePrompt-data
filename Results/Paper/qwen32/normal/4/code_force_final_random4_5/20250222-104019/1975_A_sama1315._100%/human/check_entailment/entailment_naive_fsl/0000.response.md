Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_1` function checks whether the given array `a` can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by concatenating the array with itself and checking if any subarray of length `n` (the length of `a`) matches the sorted version of `a`. The `func_2` function reads input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Sorting and Concatenation**: The function `func_1` first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`. Then, it creates a new array `concatenated_a` by concatenating `a` with itself. This step allows us to check if the sorted array can be obtained by any rotation of `a`.
2. **Checking Subarrays**: The function then iterates through possible starting points of subarrays within `concatenated_a` that have the same length as `a`. If any of these subarrays match `sorted_a`, it returns 'Yes'.
3. **Returning Result**: If no such subarray is found, the function returns 'No'.

The logic of checking subarrays within the concatenated array is correct because it covers all possible rotations of the original array `a`. If any rotation of `a` can be sorted, it will appear as a subarray in `concatenated_a`.

The `func_2` function handles multiple test cases correctly by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and then printing the results.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases, and there are no known edge cases that it fails to handle. Therefore, the correctness is True.
