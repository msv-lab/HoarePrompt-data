The code snippet appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `results` will now contain one element, which is the value of `result`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
