### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that it accurately solves the problem description. The problem requires determining whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix/suffix swaps.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if any contiguous subsequence of `a` concatenated with itself contains a sorted version of `a`.
- It does this by creating a concatenated version of the array (`concatenated_a = a + a`) and checking if any slice of this concatenated array of length `n` (the length of the original array) matches the sorted version of `a`.
- This approach is based on the idea that if a sorted version of `a` can be found as a contiguous subsequence in `a + a`, it implies that `a` can be rotated to become sorted.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
- It then calls `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints all results.

#### Correctness of the Approach:
- The approach taken by `func_1` is correct because if a sorted version of `a` can be found as a contiguous subsequence in `a + a`, it means that there exists a rotation of `a` that is sorted.
- This is because concatenating `a` with itself allows us to simulate all possible rotations of `a` in a single array.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and reads the input as specified.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations and handles multiple test cases as required.

Correctness: **True**
