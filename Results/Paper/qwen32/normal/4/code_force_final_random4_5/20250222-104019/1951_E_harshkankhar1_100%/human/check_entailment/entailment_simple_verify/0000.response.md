Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to partition a string into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes. The program should output "YES" if such a partition exists and "NO" otherwise. If "YES", it should also print the number of parts and the parts themselves.

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
```python
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]
```
- **Functionality**: This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
- **Correctness**: The function is correct for checking if a string is a palindrome.

#### Function `func_2`
```python
def func_2():
    s = input()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    if func_1(s[0:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```
- **Functionality**:
  - First, it checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome. If not, it outputs "YES", the number of parts (1), and the string itself.
  - If the entire string is a palindrome, it searches for the first character that is different from the first character.
  - If all characters are the same (`x == -1`), it outputs "NO".
  - If the substring starting from the first differing character is not a palindrome, it outputs "YES", the number of parts (2), and the two substrings.
  - If the first differing character is at index 1 or `n // 2`, it outputs "NO".
  - Otherwise, it outputs "YES", the number of parts (2), and the two substrings formed by including the first two differing characters.

### Annotations
The annotations provide a detailed state of the program at key points, which align with the program's intended logic. However, the annotations do not cover all edge cases or provide counterexamples that might challenge the correctness of the program.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where multiple characters can be used to create non-palindromic substrings. Specifically, it mentions the string `aabbcc` as a counterexample where the program might output an incorrect partition.

### Evaluation
Let's evaluate the program using the provided counterexample:

#### Test Case `aabbcc`
- **Program Logic**:
  - The entire string `aabbcc` is a palindrome.
  - The first differing character from the first character (`a`) is at index 2 (`b`).
  - The substring starting from index 3 (`cc`) is a palindrome.
  - Since the first differing character is at index 2, the program checks if `x == 1 or x == n // 2`. Here, `x == 2` and `n // 2 == 3`, so neither condition is met.
  - The program then outputs:
    ```
    YES
    2
    aab bcc
    ```
- **Correctness**:
  - The partition `aab` and `bcc` are both not palindromes, so the output is correct.
  - The program correctly handles this case.

### Conclusion
The original assessment incorrectly claims the program is incorrect. The program handles the provided test cases correctly, and the annotations support the logic of the program. The counterexample given in the original assessment does not demonstrate a failure of the program.

**Final: True**
