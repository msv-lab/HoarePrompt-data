To determine the output, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

1. `s` is the input string.
2. `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
3. `x` is the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`. This means `x` is 1-based, not 0-based.
4. `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`.
5. `x` is not equal to `-1`, meaning there is at least one character in `s` (other than the first character) that is different from `s[0]`.
6. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
```

Let's analyze this step by step:

- `s[:x + 1]` will print the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the `x`-th character (0-based index `x-1`).
- `s[x + 1:]` will print the substring from the character immediately after the `x`-th character (0-based index `x`) to the end of the string.

Given the precondition that `x` is the index of the first character different from `s[0]`, `s[:x + 1]` will include all consecutive characters that are the same as `s[0]` up to the first different character. `s[x + 1:]` will include the first different character and all characters after it.

Since `func_1(s[0:])` is `True` and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`, it means that the substring `s[0:]` satisfies some condition checked by `func_1`, but the substring `s[x + 1:]` does not.

Given these conditions, the output will be:

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the first character different from s[0], and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the first character different from s[0] to the end of s)**

However, for a more specific and precise description, let's assume an example string `s` that fits the conditions:

Example:
- `s = "aaaaabbb"`
- Here, `s[0]` is `'a'`, and the first character different from `'a'` is `'b'` at index 5 (1-based index 6).
- So, `x = 5` (1-based index).
- `s[:x + 1]` is `"aaaaab"`.
- `s[x + 1:]` is `"bb"`.

Therefore, the output in this specific case would be:

Output: **aaaaab bb**

But in a general form based on the precondition, the output should be described as:

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the first character different from s[0], and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the first character different from s[0] to the end of s)**
