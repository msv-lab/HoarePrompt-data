Output State: **The program returns None**

Explanation: The provided code snippet contains a `return` statement without any specified value, which means the function will return `None`. None of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[0:])`) are involved in the return statement, so they do not affect the output.
