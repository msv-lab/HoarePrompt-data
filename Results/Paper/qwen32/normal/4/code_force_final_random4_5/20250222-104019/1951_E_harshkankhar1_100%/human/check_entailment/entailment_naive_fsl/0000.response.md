Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly partition the string when there are multiple characters that can be used to create non-palindromic substrings. The function `func_2` only checks for the first character that is different from the first character of the string and does not consider other possible partitions.

Let's consider the following test case:
```
3
abcabcabc
abccba
aabbcc
```

For the string `abcabcabc`, the program should output:
```
YES
1
abcabcabc
```
This is correct because the entire string is not a palindrome.

For the string `abccba`, the program should output:
```
NO
```
This is correct because any partition of `abccba` will result in at least one palindrome substring.

For the string `aabbcc`, the program should output:
```
YES
3
aa bb cc
```
However, the provided program will fail to correctly partition `aabbcc` because it only checks for the first character that is different from the first character and tries to partition based on that. In this case, it might output something like:
```
YES
2
aabb cc
```
which is incorrect because `aabb` is a palindrome.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and should be considered incorrect.
