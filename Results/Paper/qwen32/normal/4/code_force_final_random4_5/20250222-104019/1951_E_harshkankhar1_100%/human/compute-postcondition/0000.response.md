The code snippet `s = input()` changes the value of `s` to the string input provided by the user. The length of the new string `s` will be the new value of `n`. The variable `x` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is -1**.
