Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True. Additionally, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns True. Furthermore, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.**
