The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `i` is already `i + 1`, so `x` will be equal to `i + 1`. The other variables, `s` and `n`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `i + 1`**.
