Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is set to `-1`, indicating that all characters in `s` are the same.
- `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[0:])`. The statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **NO**
