Let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
2. `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
3. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
5. If `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged.
6. `i` is set to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to `n` in the initial state.
- The value of `n` is given to be greater than or equal to 0.
- The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`.

Since `i` is directly set to `n`, and `n` is provided as an input that is greater than or equal to 0, the output will be the value of `n`.

### Output:
Output: **n (where n is the value of n)**
