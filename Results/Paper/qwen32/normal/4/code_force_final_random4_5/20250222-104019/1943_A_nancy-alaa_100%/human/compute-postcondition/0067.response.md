Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is True; `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
