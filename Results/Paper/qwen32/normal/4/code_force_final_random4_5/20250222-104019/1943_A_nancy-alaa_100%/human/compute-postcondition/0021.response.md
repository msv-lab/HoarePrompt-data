To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
   - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - If `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is explicitly set to `n`.

2. **Code to be executed:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The key piece of information here is that `i` is explicitly set to `n` before the print statement.
   - The value of `i` is not influenced by any other part of the code snippet (such as loops or conditions) because it is directly assigned the value of `n`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `i` is directly assigned the value of `n`, the print statement will output the value of `n`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(i)` statement is the value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the given integer value)**
