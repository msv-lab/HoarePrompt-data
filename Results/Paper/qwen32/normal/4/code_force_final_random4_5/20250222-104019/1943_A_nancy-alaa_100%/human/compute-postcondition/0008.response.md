Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is `False`; `i` is not a key in `mpp` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and the condition that `i` is not a key in `mpp` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
