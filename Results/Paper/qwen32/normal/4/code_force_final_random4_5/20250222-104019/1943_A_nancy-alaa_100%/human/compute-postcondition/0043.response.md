Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
2. **`n`**: A new input integer. This variable is also not directly used in the print statement.
3. **`arr`**: A new list of integers obtained from the input. This list is not directly used in the print statement.
4. **`mpp`**: A `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`. This object is not directly used in the print statement.
5. **`first`**: A boolean variable set to `False`. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
6. **`i`**: An integer initialized to 0. This is the variable that is printed.
7. **`i` is not a key in `mpp`**: This condition is about the `Counter` object `mpp` and does not affect the value of `i`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

### Determining the Output:
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly set to 0.
- The condition that `i` is not a key in `mpp` does not change the value of `i`; it only provides information about the `Counter` object `mpp`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
