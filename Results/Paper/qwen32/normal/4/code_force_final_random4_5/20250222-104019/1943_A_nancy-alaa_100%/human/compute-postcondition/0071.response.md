To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop step by step:

The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n`. The loop checks two conditions:
1. If `i` is not a key in the `mpp` dictionary, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
2. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
3. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we know that the loop has not broken out of the loop after these iterations. This implies that:
- For `i = 0`, `i` was a key in `mpp` and `mpp[0]` was not 1 (since `first` is initially `False`).
- For `i = 1`, `i` was a key in `mpp` and `mpp[1]` was not 1 (since `first` is still `False` after `i = 1`).
- For `i = 2`, `i` was a key in `mpp` and `mpp[2]` was not 1 (since `first` is still `False` after `i = 2`).

This pattern suggests that `mpp[i]` for `i = 0, 1, 2` is not 1, and `first` remains `False` until the first occurrence of `mpp[i] == 1`. The loop will continue until it finds an `i` where `i` is not a key in `mpp` or `mpp[i] == 1` with `first` being `True`.

The final output state will be when the loop either breaks because it finds an `i` that is not in `mpp` or finds an `i` for which `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`.

Given the pattern and the loop structure, the loop will break when `i` is not a key in `mpp` or when `i` is a key in `mpp` with `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`.

Since the specific values of `n` and the contents of `arr` are not provided, we can only determine the state in terms of the loop variables and the conditions that would cause the loop to break.

The final output state, in terms of the loop variables, will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `mpp` remains unchanged.
- `first` will be `True` if an `i` with `mpp[i] == 1` is found before `i` is not a key in `mpp`.
- `i` will be the value that causes the loop to break.

However, without specific values for `n` and `arr`, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` that causes the loop to break. The most we can say is that the loop will break when the conditions mentioned above are met.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is True if an `i` with `mpp[i] == 1` is found before `i` is not a key in `mpp`; `i` is the value that causes the loop to break.**
