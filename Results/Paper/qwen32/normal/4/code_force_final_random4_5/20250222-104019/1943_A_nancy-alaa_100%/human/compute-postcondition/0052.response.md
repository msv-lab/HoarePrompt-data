Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is True; `i` is 0. If the frequency of the element at index `i` in `mpp` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues.**
