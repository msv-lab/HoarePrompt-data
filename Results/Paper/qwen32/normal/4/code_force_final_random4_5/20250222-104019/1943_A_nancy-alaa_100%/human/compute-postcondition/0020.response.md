Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is `True`. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged; `i` is `n`.**
