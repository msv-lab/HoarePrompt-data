The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in, but it will not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is `True`; `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
