Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. The approach taken by the program is to find the smallest sequence of consecutive identical numbers in the array. If such a sequence exists, the length of this sequence is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beauty" of the array. If all elements in the array are identical, or if no such sequence exists, the program correctly outputs -1.

The program iterates through each test case, reads the array, and counts the length of consecutive identical elements. It keeps track of the minimum length of these sequences. After processing the entire array, it checks if the minimum length is still infinite (which would mean all elements were identical) or if it matches the length of the array (which would also mean all elements were identical). In either of these cases, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length found.

The logic seems correct based on the problem description and the given examples. The program efficiently finds the solution with a time complexity of O(n) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
