The code snippet `minn = inf` explicitly sets the variable `minn` to the value of `inf` (infinity). This means that any previous value of `minn` is overwritten by `inf`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is the length of `ar`, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`.**
