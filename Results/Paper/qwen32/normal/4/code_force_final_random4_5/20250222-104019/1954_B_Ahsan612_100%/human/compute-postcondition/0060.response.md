The code snippet `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is either 3 or 4. If `i` is 3, then `num` was previously equal to `ar[3]`, but now `num` is reassigned to `ar[3]` again, so no change occurs in `num` in this case. If `i` is 4, then `num` is reassigned to `ar[4]`. 

Since `i` is 3 when `ar[i]` was equal to `num` and 4 otherwise, the value of `num` after the assignment will be `ar[3]` if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` (i.e., `i` was 3), and `ar[4]` otherwise (i.e., `i` was 4).

Given these conditions, the output state is:
- `t` is still greater than 0.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `ar` remains a new list of integers with at least 4 elements.
- `i` is still 3 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 4.
- `num` is updated to `ar[3]` if `i` was 3, otherwise `num` is updated to `ar[4]`.
- `same` remains 2 if `i` was 3, otherwise `same` remains 1.
- `minn` remains `inf` if `i` was 3, otherwise `minn` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` otherwise `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` was 3 otherwise `num` is `ar[4]`, `same` is 2 if `i` was 3 otherwise `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf` if `i` was 3 otherwise `minn` is 1.**
