Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` is `ar[i]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is explicitly set to 1 by the code, while all other variables retain their initial values.
