The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is either 2 or 3 or 4 based on the conditions given. After the increment, if `i` was initially 2, it becomes 3; if `i` was initially 3, it becomes 4; and if `i` was initially 4, it becomes 5. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 4 elements. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` is 3, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 4 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` otherwise `i` is 5, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` was 3 otherwise `ar[4]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 2 if `i` was 3 otherwise `minn` is 1.**
