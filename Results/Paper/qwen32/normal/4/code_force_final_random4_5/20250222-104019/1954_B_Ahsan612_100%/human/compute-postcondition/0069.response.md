Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 6 elements, `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[4]`, `same` is 3, `minn` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`inf`) and the value of `same` (which is 3). Since 3 is less than `inf`, `minn` becomes 3. All other variables retain their initial values.
