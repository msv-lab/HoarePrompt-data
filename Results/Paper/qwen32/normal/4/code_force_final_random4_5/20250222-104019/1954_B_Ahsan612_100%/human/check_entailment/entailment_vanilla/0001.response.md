Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1`), such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`, and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and the array `ar` itself.

2. **Logic**:
   - The variable `same` is initialized to 1. This variable counts the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of the array. It keeps track of the current sequence's element.
   - The variable `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity). This variable will store the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements found in the array.
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
     - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
     - If the current element is different from `num`, it:
       - Updates `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`.
       - Resets `same` to 1.
       - Updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same` to account for the last sequence.
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array (`len(ar)`), it means all elements in the array are the same, and it prints `-1` (impossible to make it non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Correctness:
The program correctly identifies the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements in the array. If this length is 1 or if all elements are the same, it correctly outputs `-1`. However, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.

**Flaw in Logic**:
- The program only considers the minimum length of sequences of identical elements. However, the problem requires the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. This involves considering how removing elements can break the ability to make all elements the same through the described operation.
- The program does not account for the possibility of breaking the array into multiple sequences that cannot be reduced to a single value through the described operation.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct because it does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the minimum length of sequences of identical elements, which is not sufficient for solving the problem.

**Correctness: False**

### Correct Solution Approach:
A correct solution would involve a more complex analysis of the array structure and how removing elements can disrupt the ability to make all elements the same through the described operation. This might involve dynamic programming or a more intricate greedy approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove.

Correctness: **False**
