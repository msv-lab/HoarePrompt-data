Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either `ar[2]` or `ar[3]`, `minn` is either 1 or the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]`, and `same` is either 1 or increased by 1. Specifically, if `ar[2]` equals `num`, then `same` is increased by 1 and `i` remains 2. Otherwise, `num` is updated to `ar[3]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]`, `i` is updated to 3, and `same` is set to 1.**
