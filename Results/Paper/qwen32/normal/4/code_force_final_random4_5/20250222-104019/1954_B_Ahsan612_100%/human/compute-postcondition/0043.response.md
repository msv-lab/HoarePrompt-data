Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to the length of the new `ar`, `num` is the last unique number in the new `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is the minimum of its current value and 1. If `minn` is either equal to infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then `minn` retains that value. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of its current value and 1.**

In natural language: The value of `same` has been updated to 1. All other variables retain their initial values, with `minn` being updated to the minimum of its current value and 1, unless `minn` is infinity or the length of `ar`, in which case it remains unchanged.
