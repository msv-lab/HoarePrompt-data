Let's analyze the provided program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= |a| - 1`) such that `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}` and replacing `a_i` with `a_{i - 1}`.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `ar`. It then processes the array to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1, representing the count of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity (`inf`), representing the minimum length of any segment of consecutive identical elements found in the array.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different, it updates `minn` with the minimum of the current `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to update `minn` with the last segment's length.

3. **Determine the result**:
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

### Correctness Analysis
- The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in the array.
- It keeps track of the minimum length of these segments.
- The logic to determine if it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful (when `minn` is infinity or equal to the array length) is correct.
- However, the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program assumes that removing the smallest segment of identical elements will make the array stop being beautiful, which is not always the case.

### Counterexample
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
```
- The program will identify segments of length 1 (for the single `1` at the start) and 2 (for the `2`s and the final `1`s).
- It will set `minn` to 1 and output 1.
- However, removing a single element (e.g., the first `1`) will not make the array stop being beautiful. Instead, the array will become `[2, 2, 1, 1]`, which is still beautiful.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
