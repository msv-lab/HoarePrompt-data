The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. Given that `i` is 5, `num` is now assigned the value of `ar[5]`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still greater than 0.
- `n` is still an input integer.
- `ar` is still a list of integers with at least 5 elements.
- `minn` is still either 1 or the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]`.
- `same` is still either 1 or increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `i` is 5, `num` is `ar[5]`, `minn` is either 1 or the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]`, and `same` is either 1 or increased by 1.**
