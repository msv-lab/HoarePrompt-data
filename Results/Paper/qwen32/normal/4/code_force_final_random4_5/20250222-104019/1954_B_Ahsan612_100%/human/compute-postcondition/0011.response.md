The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was 1, so after the increment, `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
