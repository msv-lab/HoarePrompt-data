The `while` loop condition is `i < len(ar)`, so we need to ensure that this condition holds true for the next iteration. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements
- `i` is either 3 or 4
- `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`
- `same` is either 2, 3, or 1 depending on the values of `ar[i-1]` and `ar[i-2]`
- `minn` is either `inf` or 1 depending on the value of `same`

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `ar` has at least 4 elements, `len(ar)` is at least 4. Therefore, `i` can be 3 or 4 at the end of the previous iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

If `i` is currently 3, it can be incremented to 4, and the loop will execute again because `4 < len(ar)` (since `len(ar) >= 4`).
If `i` is currently 4, it can be incremented to 5, and the loop will execute again if `len(ar) > 4`.

However, since we are only asked to adjust the state for the next iteration to proceed, we can simply ensure `i` is incremented by 1, provided it is still less than `len(ar)`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted so that `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was either 3 or 4 at the end of the previous iteration), `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `same` is either 2, 3, or 1 depending on the values of `ar[i-1]` and `ar[i-2]`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1 depending on the value of `same`**
