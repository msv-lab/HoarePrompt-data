The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`.

- If `i` was 3, then `minn` was initially `inf` and `same` was 2. After the execution, `minn` becomes 2 because `min(inf, 2)` is 2.
- If `i` was not 3, then `minn` was initially 1 and `same` was 1. After the execution, `minn` remains 1 because `min(1, 1)` is 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` otherwise `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` was 3 otherwise `num` is `ar[4]`, `same` is 2 if `i` was 3 otherwise `same` is 1, `minn` is 2 if `i` was 3 otherwise `minn` is 1.**
