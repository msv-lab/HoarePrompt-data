Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers, `i` is the length of `ar`, `num` is the last unique element in a sequence, `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements, and `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.**

In simple terms, the value of `minn` has been updated to be the smaller of its previous value and the value of `same`. All other variables remain unchanged.
