The code snippet assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` (which was initially `ar[0]`). After the assignment, `num` will take the value of `ar[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is `inf`.**
