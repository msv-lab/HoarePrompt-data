Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is `i + 2` (where `i` was either 3 or 4 at the end of the previous iteration), `num` is `ar[i]`, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been updated to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
