The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes several variables and their relationships but does not affect the value printed by this specific `print` statement. Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `-1`, the value of `-1` will be printed regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `same`, and `minn`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is described as being greater than 0.
2. The variable `n` is described as an input integer.
3. The variable `ar` is described as a list of integers.
4. The variable `i` is described as being equal to the length of the list `ar`.
5. The variable `num` is described as the last unique element in the list `ar`.
6. The variable `same` is described as the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in `ar`.
7. The variable `minn` is described as either `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`.

None of these variables are used in the `print` statement, which simply outputs `-1`.

Output: **-1**
