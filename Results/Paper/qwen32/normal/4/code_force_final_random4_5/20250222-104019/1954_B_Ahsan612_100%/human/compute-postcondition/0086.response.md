The value of `i` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`.**
