The code snippet provided is `same = 1`. This line of code reassigns the value of the variable `same` to 1. However, the initial state already specifies that `same` is 1, so the value of `same` does not change after executing this line of code.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with no changes to any variables.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
