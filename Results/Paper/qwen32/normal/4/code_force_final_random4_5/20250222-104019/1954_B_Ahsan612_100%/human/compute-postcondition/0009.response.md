Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`, `i` is 1, and `ar[i]` equals `num`.**

In simple terms, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
