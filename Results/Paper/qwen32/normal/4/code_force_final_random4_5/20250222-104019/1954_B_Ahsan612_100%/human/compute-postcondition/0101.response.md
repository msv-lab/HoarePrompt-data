Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` is `ar[i]`, `same` is 2 if `ar[i-1]` equals `ar[i]`, otherwise `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given the initial conditions, if `same` is 2, `minn` was initially `inf` and thus gets updated to 2. If `same` is 1, `minn` was initially 1 and remains 1. Therefore, `minn` will always be 1 after this operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
