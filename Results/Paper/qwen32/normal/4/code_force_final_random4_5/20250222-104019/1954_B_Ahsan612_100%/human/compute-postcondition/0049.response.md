The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**
