Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `p` is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique element in `l`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The value of `k` is an integer read from the input.
- The print statement `print(k - 1)` simply subtracts 1 from the value of `k` and prints the result.

### Output:
The output will be the value of `k` minus 1. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is an integer read from the input)**
