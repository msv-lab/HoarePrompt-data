Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `i` is 1; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a new list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique element in `l`. The maximum value in `p` is either greater than or equal to `k` or less than `k`.**
