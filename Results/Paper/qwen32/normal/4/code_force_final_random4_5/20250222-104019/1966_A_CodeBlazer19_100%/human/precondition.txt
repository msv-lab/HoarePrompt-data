t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100) and a list of integers c of length n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). Each tuple represents a test case with n cards, the operation parameter k, and the numbers written on the cards.
