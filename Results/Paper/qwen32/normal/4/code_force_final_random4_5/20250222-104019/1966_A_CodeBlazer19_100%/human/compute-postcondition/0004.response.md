The code snippet creates a new list `p` where each element is the count of a unique element in the list `l`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and the original `l` remain unchanged. The new list `p` contains the frequency of each unique element in `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique element in `l`.**
