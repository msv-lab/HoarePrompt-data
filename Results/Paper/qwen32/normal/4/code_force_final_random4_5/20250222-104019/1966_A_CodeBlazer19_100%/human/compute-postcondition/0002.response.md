The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500, and `i` is 0. The variables `n` and `k` are not mentioned in the initial state, so they are introduced by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**

In natural language, this means that `t` remains as an input integer within the specified range, `i` remains 0, and `n` and `k` are now assigned the values of the two integers provided in the input.
