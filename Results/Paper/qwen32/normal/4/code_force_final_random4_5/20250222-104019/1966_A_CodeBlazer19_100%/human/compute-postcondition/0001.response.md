The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is determined by `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `c`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `i` is 0**
