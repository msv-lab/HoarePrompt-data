The code snippet provided assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `r`. Given that `index` is `2n + 5`, the value assigned to `r` will be `data[2n + 6]`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the elements from `a[1]` to `a[n]` which are `int(data[index])` for each respective iteration; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 5`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for each respective iteration; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value from `pf` and maps to a list of indices `i` where that XOR value was achieved; `l` is `int(data[2n + 5])`; `r` is `int(data[2n + 6])`.**
