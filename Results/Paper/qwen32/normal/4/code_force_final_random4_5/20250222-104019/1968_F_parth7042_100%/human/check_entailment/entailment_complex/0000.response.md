### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and correctness of the provided Python program.

The task is to determine if a subarray can be split into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

The program uses a prefix XOR array (`pf`) to compute the XOR of any subarray efficiently. Specifically, the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` can be computed as `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. If this value is zero, it means the entire subarray can be considered as one part with XOR zero, which is trivially interesting.

However, if the XOR of the subarray is not zero, we need to check if we can split the subarray into parts such that the XOR of each part is equal. The program uses a dictionary (`mp`) to keep track of the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

For each query, the program computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` and checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR array that could potentially split this subarray into parts with equal XOR. Specifically, it looks for indices where the prefix XOR matches the prefix XOR of the subarray and ensures these indices fall within the range `[l, r]`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic for each query:
1. Compute the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` as `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
2. If `x` is zero, the subarray is trivially interesting, so the answer is "YES".
3. Otherwise, find the list of indices where the prefix XOR equals `pf[r]` (`v1`) and the list of indices where the prefix XOR equals `pf[l-1]` (`v2`).
4. Use binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the first index in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l` (`it1`) and the last index in `v2` that is less than or equal to `r` (`it2`).
5. If `it1` is a valid index in `v1` and `it2` is a valid index in `v2`, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, it means there is a valid split point, so the answer is "YES". Otherwise, the answer is "NO".

The program handles multiple test cases and efficiently processes each query using prefix XOR and binary search, ensuring it meets the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
Given the logic and the constraints, the program correctly determines if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
