The code snippet `mp[0].append(0)` modifies the defaultdict `mp` by appending the value `0` to the list associated with the key `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 5`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with the key `0` mapping to the list `[0]`.**
