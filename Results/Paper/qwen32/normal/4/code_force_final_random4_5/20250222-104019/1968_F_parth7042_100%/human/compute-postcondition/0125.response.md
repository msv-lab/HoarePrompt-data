Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `q` is greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the elements from `a[1]` to `a[n]` which are `int(data[index - 2])` for each respective iteration; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 9`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO') with an additional 'YES' if `x` equals 0, and now also contains an additional 'YES'; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for each respective iteration; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value from `pf` and maps to a list of indices `i` where that XOR value was achieved; `l` is `int(data[2n + 7])`; `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the insertion point in `v1` for the value `l` found using binary search; `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

In natural language: The `results` list now contains an additional 'YES'. All other variables remain unchanged.
