The given Python code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change in the state is the addition of `'YES'` to the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[2n + 2(q-1) + 3]`; `q` is greater than 0; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is the initial `index` value plus 2; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; if `x` is 0, `'YES'` is appended to `results`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]; it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1`; `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; `'YES'` is appended to `results`.**
