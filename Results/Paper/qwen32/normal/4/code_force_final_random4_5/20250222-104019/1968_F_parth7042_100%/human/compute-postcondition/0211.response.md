The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[2n + 2(q-1) + 3]`; `q` is greater than 0; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2.
