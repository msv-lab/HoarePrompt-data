Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`, and `mp[data[3]]` is `[i]`; `i` is `n + 1`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
