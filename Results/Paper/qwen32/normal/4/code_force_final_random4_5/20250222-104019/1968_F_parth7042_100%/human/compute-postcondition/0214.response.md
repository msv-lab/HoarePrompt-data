The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given this, none of the variables listed in the initial state are affected by the `continue` statement. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[2n + 2(q-1) + 3]`; `q` is greater than 0; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is the initial `index` value plus 2; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` has `'YES'` appended to it.**
