The code snippet `index += 1` increments the value of the variable `index` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 7`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `int(data[index])`; `mp` is a defaultdict with the key `0` mapping to the list `[0, i]` if `pf[i]` is `0`, or with an additional key `pf[i]` mapping to the list `[i]` if `pf[i]` is not `0`; `i` is `n`**
