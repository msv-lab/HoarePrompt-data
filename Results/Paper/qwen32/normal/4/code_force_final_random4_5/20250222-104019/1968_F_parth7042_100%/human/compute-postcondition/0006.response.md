The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`, where `index` is 1. Therefore, `n` is now the integer value of `data[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q`, `a`, and `data` are unchanged, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**.
