Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is 2 and the loop or if statement is broken out of accordingly.**
