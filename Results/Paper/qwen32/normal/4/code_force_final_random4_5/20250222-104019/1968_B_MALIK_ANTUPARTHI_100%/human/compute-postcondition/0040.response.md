The only variable in the loop head is `j` and the range is defined by `b`. Therefore, the state of `b` is the only one that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. If `b` is at least 1, the loop will execute.

Given the provided state, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input. To ensure the loop executes, `b` must be greater than 0.

The state of `i` is mentioned as `i is i + 1`, which doesn't make sense in the context of the initial state before the loop starts. The variable `i` is not part of the loop head and its value should be defined before the loop starts if it is to be used within the loop.

Since the task specifies only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we will focus on `b` and ignore the incorrect state of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the string input by the user, `e` is the value of the user input, `k` is 0**
