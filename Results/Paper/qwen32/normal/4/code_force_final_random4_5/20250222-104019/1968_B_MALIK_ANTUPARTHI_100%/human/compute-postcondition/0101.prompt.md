Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is `b - 1`, `k` is `0`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is 0, `k` is 1 if `d[j]` (which is `d[0]`) is in the sublist `e[k-1:]` and either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, otherwise `k` remains 0. `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input, and the loop or if statement is broken out of accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `k` is set to 1. The loop or if statement is broken out of accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input. If `d[2]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to its position in `e` starting from index `k` plus 1, plus `k`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of with `k` set to 3. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables. If `d[2]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
