The code snippet `k = j + 1` changes the value of `k` to `j + 1`. The initial value of `j` is 1, so `k` will be updated to `1 + 1`, which is `2`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`) remain unchanged. The loop or if statement is broken out of accordingly, as per the initial state.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input, and the loop or if statement is broken out of accordingly.**
