Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the value of the user input, `e` is the value of the user input, `j` is `j_old + 1` where `j_old` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, `k` is equal to `j`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` is set to the value of `j`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial conditions.
