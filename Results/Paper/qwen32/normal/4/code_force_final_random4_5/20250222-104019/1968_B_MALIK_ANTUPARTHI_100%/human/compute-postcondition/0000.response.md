Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5. a and b are binary strings of length n and m, respectively. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `a` is an input integer.**

In this output state, `a` has been assigned the value of an input integer, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `b`) retain their initial states as described.
