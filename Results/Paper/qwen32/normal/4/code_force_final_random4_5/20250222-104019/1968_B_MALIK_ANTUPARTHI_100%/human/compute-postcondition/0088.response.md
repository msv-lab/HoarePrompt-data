Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input, and the loop or if statement is broken out of accordingly.**

Explanation: The `break` statement only affects the control flow by exiting the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values as described.
