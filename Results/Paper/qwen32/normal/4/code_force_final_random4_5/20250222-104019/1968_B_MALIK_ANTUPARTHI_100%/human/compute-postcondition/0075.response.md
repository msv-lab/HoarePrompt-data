Postcondition: **`j` is 0, `k` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input, and `d[j]` (which is `d[0]`) is in the sublist `e[k:]` (which is `e[0:]`)**

This postcondition retains all the information from the precondition and includes the if condition, specifying that the first element of `d` is present in the list `e` starting from index `k` (which is 0 in this case).
