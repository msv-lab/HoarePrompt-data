Postcondition: **`j` is 0, `k` is 1 if `d[j]` (which is `d[0]`) is in the sublist `e[k-1:]` and either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, otherwise `k` remains 0. `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input, and the loop or if statement is broken out of accordingly.**
