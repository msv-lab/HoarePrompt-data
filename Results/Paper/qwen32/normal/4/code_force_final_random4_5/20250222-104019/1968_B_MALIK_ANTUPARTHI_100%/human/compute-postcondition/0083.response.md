Output State: **`j` is 0, `k` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input, and `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `j`, `k`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value. The condition that `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]` is still valid. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
