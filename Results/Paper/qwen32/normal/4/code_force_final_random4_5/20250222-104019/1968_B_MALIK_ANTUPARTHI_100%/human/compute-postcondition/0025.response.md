To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is `j` in this case.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5
- `a` is an integer greater than 0
- `b` is an integer greater than 0
- `c` is an integer
- `d` is the value of the user input
- `e` is the value of the user input
- `j` is `j_old + 1` where `j_old` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration

The loop is defined as:
```
for j in range(b):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `b-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, if `j` at the end of the previous iteration was `j_old`, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_old + 1`.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop's iteration mechanism.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the value of the user input, `e` is the value of the user input, `j` is `j_old + 1` where `j_old` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since `j` at the end of the previous iteration was `j_old`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_old + 1`. If `j_old` was `j`, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the value of the user input, `e` is the value of the user input, `j` is `j + 1`**.
