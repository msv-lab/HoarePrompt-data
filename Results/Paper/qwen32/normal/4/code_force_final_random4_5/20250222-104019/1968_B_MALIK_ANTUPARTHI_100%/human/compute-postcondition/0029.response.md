Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the value of the user input, `e` is the value of the user input. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, then `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is `j + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.**
