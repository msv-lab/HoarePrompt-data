Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `k` is set to 1. The loop or if statement is broken out of accordingly.**
