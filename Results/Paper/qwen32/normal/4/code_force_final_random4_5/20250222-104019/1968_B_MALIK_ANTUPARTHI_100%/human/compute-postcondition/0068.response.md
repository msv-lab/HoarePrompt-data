To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the context of the variables `j` and `k`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`j` is `b - 1`**: This tells us that `j` is set to the value of `b` minus one. However, the value of `b` is not explicitly given, so we can only describe `j` in terms of `b`.
2. **`k` is updated based on the last iteration or the conditions that caused the break**: This indicates that `k` is the result of some computation or iteration that stopped due to a break condition. The exact value of `k` is dependent on the logic that precedes the `print` statement, which is not provided.

### Analysis:
Given that `k` is updated based on some previous logic and a break condition, we can infer that `k` holds a specific value that was determined by the last iteration of a loop or some conditional logic. However, without the complete code or additional context about how `k` is updated, we can only describe `k` in terms of the conditions that led to its final value.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `k` is not explicitly provided and depends on the preceding logic, we can only describe it in a general manner.

Output: **k (where k is the value determined by the last iteration or the conditions that caused the break)**
