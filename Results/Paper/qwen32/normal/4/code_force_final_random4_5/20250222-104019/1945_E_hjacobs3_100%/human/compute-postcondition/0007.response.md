The value of `r` is updated to the value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation; `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be at least 2; `l` is 0; `r` is `n // 2`; `mid` is `n // 2`. The element at `array[mid]` is greater than `find`.
