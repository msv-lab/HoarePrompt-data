### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using a binary search to find the position where the number `x` should be located in the permutation array `p` after performing at most two swaps. The program's logic is flawed for the following reasons:

1. **Binary Search on Unsorted Array**: The program performs a binary search on an unsorted array, which is not valid. Binary search requires the array to be sorted to ensure correct results.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps**: The program only considers one swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `find`. However, the problem statement guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, and the program does not cover all possible cases where two swaps might be necessary.
3. **Output Format**: The program prints the number of swaps directly inside the `func_1` function, which is not the correct approach. The number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped should be returned as a list of strings, as specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore:

**Correctness: False**
