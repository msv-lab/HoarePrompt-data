To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables `l` and `r` in the loop head condition `r - l > 1`.

Given the loop:
```
while r - l > 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will continue to execute as long as the difference between `r` and `l` is greater than 1. 

### Analysis:
- `l` and `r` are the variables that determine whether the loop can execute again.
- The condition `r - l > 1` must be satisfied for the loop to continue.

### Current State:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5).
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation.
- `n` is the length of `array`.
- `mid` is `n // 2`.
- If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is updated to `n // 2`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `n // 2`.

### Adjustment:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `r - l` must be greater than 1.
- Since `mid` is always `n // 2`, we need to adjust `l` and `r` such that `r - l > 1`.

### Possible Adjustments:
- If `l` has been updated to `n // 2`, then `r` should be greater than `n // 2 + 1`.
- If `r` has been updated to `n // 2`, then `l` should be less than `n // 2 - 1`.

Since we don't have specific values for `l` and `r` from the previous iteration, we can make a general adjustment to ensure the condition `r - l > 1` holds.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `l` and `r` such that their difference is greater than 1. Given the current state, we can set `l` to 0 and `r` to `n` to guarantee that `r - l > 1`.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, `mid` remains `n // 2`**
