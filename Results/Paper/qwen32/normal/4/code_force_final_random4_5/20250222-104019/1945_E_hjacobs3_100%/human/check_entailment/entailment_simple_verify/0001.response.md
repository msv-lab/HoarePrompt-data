### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search is performed on the original permutation without any modifications. Since the permutation is not sorted, the binary search will not function as expected.
   - The binary search algorithm relies on the array being sorted to correctly determine the position of the target element. In this problem, the array is a permutation, which is not sorted, so the binary search will yield incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps:**
   - The program only considers one swap if `l` is not the index of `x`. However, the problem statement guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient to achieve the desired result.
   - The program does not explore the possibility of performing two swaps to sort the array in such a way that the binary search will correctly place `p[l]` at `x`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the swaps as strings, but the main loop prints them directly, which is inconsistent with the problem's output requirements.
   - The program should return the swaps in the format specified in the problem description.

### Evaluation:
Given the issues identified in the original assessment, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The program does not ensure that the binary search will place `p[l]` at `x` after at most two swaps, and it does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
