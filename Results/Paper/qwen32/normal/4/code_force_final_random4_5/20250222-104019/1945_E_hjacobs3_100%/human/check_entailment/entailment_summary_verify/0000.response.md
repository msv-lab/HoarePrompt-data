Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the given program.

### Problem Description Recap
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
- We can perform at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
- After rearranging, we perform a binary search to find `x` such that `p_l = x` at the end of the binary search.

### Provided Program Code
```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if l != array.index(find):
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)
```

### Function Summary Recap
- The function `func_1` takes a list `array` and an integer `find`.
- It performs a binary search on the array to find the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= find`.
- If `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, it prints 1 and returns the indices to swap.
- If `l` is equal to the index of `find`, it prints 0.

### Issues in the Provided Program
1. **Binary Search on Unsorted Array**: The provided function performs a binary search on an unsorted array. Binary search requires a sorted array to work correctly.
2. **Swapping Logic**: The logic for swapping is incorrect. The function only checks if the element at index `l` is equal to `x` and performs one swap if necessary. It does not ensure that the array is in a state where binary search can correctly find `x` after at most two swaps.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function does not handle cases where two swaps are necessary or when `x` is at the boundaries of the array.
4. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The function should output the number of swaps followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped, but it does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary.

### Example Analysis
For the input:
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
2
1 3
2 4
```
The provided program outputs:
```
1
3 2
```
This output is incorrect because it only performs one swap and does not correctly rearrange the array to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position after at most two swaps.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. The binary search is performed on an unsorted array, the swapping logic is incorrect, and the output format is not properly handled.

Final: **False**
