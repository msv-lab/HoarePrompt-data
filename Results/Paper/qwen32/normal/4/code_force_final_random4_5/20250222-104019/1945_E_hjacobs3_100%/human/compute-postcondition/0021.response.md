The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the variables `l` and `r` in the context of a search operation on an array, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `l` is defined as the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`.
- `r` is defined as the smallest index such that `array[r] > find` (or `n` if no such element exists).
- The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **1**
