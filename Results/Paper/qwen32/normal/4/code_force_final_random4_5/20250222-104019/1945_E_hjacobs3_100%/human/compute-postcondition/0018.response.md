Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is `n // 2`. If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to `n // 2`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `n // 2`.**
