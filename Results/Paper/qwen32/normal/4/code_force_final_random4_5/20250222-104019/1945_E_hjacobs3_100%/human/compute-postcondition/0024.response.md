In the given task, the `print` statement is:

```python
print(0)
```

The initial state describes the values of `l` and `r` in relation to the `array` and `find`, but it does not affect the value that is printed by this specific `print` statement. The `print(0)` statement will simply output the integer `0` regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `array`, or `find`.

Thus, the explanation and the output are straightforward:

The `print(0)` statement will output the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
