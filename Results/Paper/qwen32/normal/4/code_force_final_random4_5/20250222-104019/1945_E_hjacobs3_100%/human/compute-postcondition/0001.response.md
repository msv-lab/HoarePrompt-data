The code snippet initializes two variables, `l` and `r`, which are used to represent the left and right boundaries of a search range. Here, `l` is set to 0 and `r` is set to `n`, the length of the array.

Given this, the output state will reflect the updated values of `l` and `r` while keeping the rest of the initial state unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation; `n` is the length of `array`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n`.**
