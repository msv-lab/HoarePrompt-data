Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of `l + 1`, and the second string is the value of the index of `find` in the array plus one.**

To break it down:
- `l + 1` is the string representation of the index `l` incremented by 1.
- `array.index(find) + 1` is the string representation of the index where `find` is located in the array, incremented by 1.
