Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer where t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, and there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone. `numbers` is a list containing one element, which is a list `[num1, num2]`. `nums` is a list of strings from the input, `num1` is an integer equal to `int(nums[0])`, and `num2` is an integer equal to `int(nums[1])`.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer between 2 and 2 × 10^5. The value of `t` remains 1. The tree structure and its properties (having exactly two leaves and being represented by n-1 edges) remain unchanged. The list `numbers` now contains one element, which is a list with two integers `[num1, num2]`. The list `nums` and the integers `num1` and `num2` remain unchanged.
