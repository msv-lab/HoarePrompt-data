Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `t` is the number of test cases and is greater than 0.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` and `k` are integer inputs.
- `k` is less than `n - 1`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(n - 1)
```

The `print` statement will output the value of `n - 1`. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is an integer input)**
