You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    1

Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives multiple test cases. Each test case is a tuple of two integers (n, k) where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of islands and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2) represents the maximum number of bridges Dominater can destroy.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the program has printed either `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, or `n - 1` if `k` is less than `n - 1`. The variable `i` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that all iterations are completed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves `n` islands where initially all islands are connected by bridges. Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit. The goal is to find the minimum number of islands Everule can reach if Dominater acts optimally.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial Connectivity**: Initially, all islands are connected, so Everule can visit all `n` islands.
2. **Dominater's Action**: Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges. The optimal strategy for Dominater is to disconnect as many islands as possible from island 1.
3. **Minimum Reachable Islands**:
   - If `k < n - 1`, Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands. Therefore, Everule can still visit at least `n - k` islands (including island 1).
   - If `k >= n - 1`, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands by destroying `n - 1` bridges. Thus, Everule can only visit island 1.

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows this logic:

- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` (number of islands) and `k` (number of bridges Dominater can destroy).
- If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).
- Otherwise, it prints `n - 1` (Everule can visit `n - 1` islands, including island 1).

### Evaluation

The program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem statement. Here are the test cases from the problem statement and their expected outputs:

1. `n = 2`, `k = 0`: Output is `2` (no bridges are destroyed, so Everule can visit both islands).
2. `n = 2`, `k = 1`: Output is `1` (one bridge is destroyed, disconnecting island 1 from island 2).
3. `n = 4`, `k = 1`: Output is `4` (one bridge is destroyed, but island 1 can still reach all other islands through alternative paths).
4. `n = 5`, `k = 10`: Output is `1` (all possible bridges are destroyed, isolating island 1).
5. `n = 5`, `k = 3`: Output is `5` (destroying 3 bridges does not isolate island 1 from all other islands).
6. `n = 4`, `k = 4`: Output is `1` (destroying 4 bridges isolates island 1).

The program produces the correct output for all these test cases.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem based on the given conditions and test cases.
