Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers taken from the new input.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n - 1)
```

From the initial state, we know that `n` is an integer input for each test case. However, the value of `n` is not explicitly given; it is part of the input for each test case. The print statement is only concerned with the value of `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `n - 1` for each test case.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the integer input for each test case)**
