Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t`, `n` must be greater than `t`, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t`, `n` must be greater than `t + 1`, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` and then the first character of the last string in `a` again, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a` again, `i` is `t + 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
