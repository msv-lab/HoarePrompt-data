The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` updates the `last_row` variable by appending the last character of the last string in the list `a` to it.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t-1`
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `m` is the second integer read from the input
- `a` is a list containing the first input string and the newly appended string
- `first_row` is the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the newly appended string
- `last_row` is the last character of the newly appended string
- `i` is 1

The code modifies `last_row` to be the concatenation of its current value and the last character of the newly appended string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing the first input string and the newly appended string, `first_row` is the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the newly appended string, `last_row` is the last character of the newly appended string concatenated with the last character of the newly appended string, `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms: `last_row` now includes the last character of the last string in `a` appended to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
