The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `last_row`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t-1` (the value of `t` is not specified but it remains `t-1` after the operation)
- `n` must be greater than 0 (this condition remains valid)
- `m` is the second integer read from the input (the value of `m` is not specified but it remains unchanged)
- `a` is a list containing the first input string (the list `a` remains unchanged)
- `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a` (the value of `first_row` is not specified but it remains unchanged)
- `last_row` is an empty string (this will change)
- `i` is 0 (the value of `i` is not specified but it remains unchanged)

After the code execution:
- `last_row` will be the last character of the last element in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing the first input string, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a`, `i` is 0.**
