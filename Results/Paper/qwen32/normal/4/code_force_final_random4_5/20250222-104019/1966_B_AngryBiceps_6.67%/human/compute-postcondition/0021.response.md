Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`. The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`. Either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.**
