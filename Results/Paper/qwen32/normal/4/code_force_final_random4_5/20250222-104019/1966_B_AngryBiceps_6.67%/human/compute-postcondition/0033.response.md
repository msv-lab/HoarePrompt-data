The provided Python code snippet appends the result of `input()` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, the variable `a` is initially an empty list. After the execution of the code, `a` will contain one element, which is the string input by the user.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing the first input string, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**.
