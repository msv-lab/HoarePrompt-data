The code snippet `last_row = ''` sets the `last_row` variable to an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language: The variable `last_row` has been reset to an empty string, while all other variables retain their initial values.
