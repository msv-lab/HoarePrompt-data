Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the second integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains `t-1`, `n` and `m` retain their initial values as read from the input. The list `a` contains all `n` input strings that were read during the loop. The string `first_row` is formed by concatenating the first character of each input string, and `last_row` is formed by concatenating the last character of each input string. The variable `i` ends up being `n-1`, which is its final value after the loop completes all iterations.
