The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` concatenates the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the current value of `first_row`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer read from the input
- `a` is a list containing three elements: the original input string, the new input string, and the newly appended input string
- `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the first string in `a` and the first character of the second string in `a`
- `last_row` is the concatenation of the original `last_row` and the last character of the last string in `a`
- `i` is 2

After executing the code, `first_row` will be updated to include the first character of the last string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements: the original input string, the new input string, and the newly appended input string, `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the first string in `a`, the first character of the second string in `a`, and the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the concatenation of the original `last_row` and the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is 2.**
