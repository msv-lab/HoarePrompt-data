### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using the described operations. The logic of the program is based on the observation that if the first row of the grid is not uniform (all same color), or if the first and last rows are the same, then it is possible to make the entire grid uniform. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Let's analyze the given code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of `m` characters each, representing the grid.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - It constructs two strings, `first_row` and `last_row`, which are the first and last columns of the grid, respectively.
   - It checks two conditions:
     - If the first row is uniform (all characters are the same) and the first row is different from the last row, it prints "NO".
     - If the first column is uniform (all characters are the same) and the first column is different from the last column, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, the logic in the program is flawed. The correct condition should be that if there is at least one row or one column that is uniform, then it is possible to make the entire grid uniform. The current logic incorrectly handles cases where the first row or column is uniform but the first and last rows or columns are the same, which should still allow the grid to be made uniform.

For example, consider the following grid:
```
W W W
B B B
W W W
```
Here, the first and last rows are the same, but the first row is uniform. The program would incorrectly print "NO" for this case, even though it is possible to make the entire grid uniform by selecting the first and last rows.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
