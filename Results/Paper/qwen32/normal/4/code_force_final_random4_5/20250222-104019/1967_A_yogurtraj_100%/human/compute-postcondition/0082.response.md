Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `ii` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `k` is not equal to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
```

### Calculation:
1. **Calculate `r`**: 
   - `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. 
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Calculate `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`**:
   - First, calculate `r - 1`.
   - Multiply the result by `n`.
   - Add 1 to the result.
   - Add `k % n` to the result, where `k % n` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`.

### Step-by-step Explanation:
- Let's denote the last element of the list `a` as `a_last`.
- Therefore, `r = a_last + k // n`.
- Then, `r - 1 = a_last + k // n - 1`.
- Multiplying by `n`: `(r - 1) * n = (a_last + k // n - 1) * n`.
- Adding 1: `(r - 1) * n + 1 = (a_last + k // n - 1) * n + 1`.
- Finally, adding `k % n`: `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n = (a_last + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.

### Simplifying the Expression:
- This expression can be simplified to: `(a_last * n + k - n + 1) + k % n`.
- Which further simplifies to: `a_last * n + k - n + 1 + k % n`.
- Since `k = k // n * n + k % n`, we can rewrite the expression as: `a_last * n + k - n + 1 + k % n`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`, which based on the given initial state and calculations, is `a_last * n + k - n + 1 + k % n`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **(a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n) (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `k` is the integer obtained from the input, and `n` is the integer obtained from the input)**
