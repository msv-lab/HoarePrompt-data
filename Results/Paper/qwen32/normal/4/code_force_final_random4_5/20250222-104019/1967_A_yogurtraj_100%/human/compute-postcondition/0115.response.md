The code snippet provided updates the value of `rem` based on the current value of `k` and `i`. Specifically, it calculates `rem` as `k % (i + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged unless their values are dependent on `k` or `rem`, which is not the case here.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100
- `ii` is 2
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `i` is 4
- `r` is `a[4] + k // 5`
- If ((`i` + 1) * (`a[i + 1]` - `a[i]`) > `k`), then `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - 4 * (a[5] - a[4])`, `rem` is either 0 or `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`.

Since the code snippet only updates `rem` and does not affect the conditions or the values of `k` or any other variables directly, we can determine the output state as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 4, `r` is `a[4] + k // 5`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `k` is either 0 or `k - 4 * (a[5] - a[4])`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `rem` is now `k % 5` (since `i` is 4, `i + 1` is 5). All other variables retain their previous values unless `k` or `rem` influenced them, which they do not in this context.
