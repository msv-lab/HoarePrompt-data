The value of `r` is updated to be the last element of the list `a` plus the integer division of `k` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `k` is not equal to 0.**
