Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is either 0 or `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is either `a[i + 1]` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. If ((`i` + 1) * (`a[i + 1]` - `a[i]`) > `k`), then `k` is 0, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
