The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. The other variables retain their previous values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. The current value of `i` satisfies the condition that ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k)**.
