The only variable in the loop head is `ii`. According to the loop statement, `ii` ranges from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be incremented by `1`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `r` is `a[n - 1]`**
