To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration. Here's a breakdown of the loop and the variables involved:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `a` are read from the input. `a` is then sorted.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list `a`.
   - It checks if the remaining `k` can cover the difference between consecutive elements in the list.
   - If `k` is insufficient to cover the difference, it calculates the final `r` and the remainder `rem`, and breaks the loop.
   - If `k` is sufficient, it subtracts the necessary amount from `k` and continues.
3. **Final Calculation**:
   - If the loop completes without breaking, it calculates the final `r`.
   - It then prints the result based on the final values of `r`, `rem`, and `y`.

Given the description of the loop and the states after the first three iterations, it is clear that the final state after all `t` iterations will be characterized by the same structure but with the iteration index `ii` reaching `t-1`.

**Output State: **t** is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input for the last test case, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input for the last test case, `rem` is 0 or the remainder from the last iteration, `y` is 0 or the number of elements left to process in the last iteration. If `k` is not equal to 0 after the last iteration, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `r` is `a[n - 1]`. The final output is calculated based on the final values of `r`, `rem`, and `y` and printed.**

In simpler terms, the final output state after all iterations is the state that results from processing the last test case in the input. The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` will reflect the state after the last test case has been processed, and the final result will be printed based on these values.
