The code snippet provided is `rem = 0`, which sets the variable `rem` to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `y`, `r`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`.**
