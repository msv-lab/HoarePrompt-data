Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum score based on the problem description. The program attempts to find the maximum number of subarrays of length `n` that can be permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` after buying up to `k` new cards.

Here are some issues with the program:
1. The logic for distributing the `k` new cards among the different types of cards is flawed. The program does not ensure that all types of cards are present in every subarray of length `n`.
2. The calculation of the final score is incorrect. The program does not properly account for the number of valid permutations of length `n` that can be formed.
3. The program does not handle the case where `k` is large enough to make all card counts equal to the maximum possible count, which would maximize the number of valid permutations.

To correctly solve the problem, one should:
- Determine the minimum number of cards needed to form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- Calculate how many such permutations can be formed with the initial cards and the additional `k` cards.
- Ensure that the distribution of cards allows for the maximum number of valid permutations.

The provided program does not implement this logic correctly, hence it is incorrect.
