The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is 4, this means `r` will be assigned the value of `a[5]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 4, `k` is `k - 5 * (a[5] - a[4])`, `r` is `a[5]`.**
