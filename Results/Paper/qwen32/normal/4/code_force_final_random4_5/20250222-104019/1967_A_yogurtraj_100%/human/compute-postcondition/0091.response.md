The given code snippet only contains the statement `rem = 0`, which sets the variable `rem` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[0]`.**
