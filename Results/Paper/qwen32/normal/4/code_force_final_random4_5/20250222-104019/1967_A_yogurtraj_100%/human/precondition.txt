t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, an integer k such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, and a list a of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^12. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
