The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `r` is now assigned the value of `a[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is either 0 or `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[4]`. `i` is 3 and `k` is `k - 4 * (a[4] - a[3])`.**
