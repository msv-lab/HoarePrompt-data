Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**

In simple terms, the value of `k` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
