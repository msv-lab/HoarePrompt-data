The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the sorted list `a` and the integer `k`. The value is determined by distributing `k` across the elements of `a` in a particular manner and then computing a final result.
