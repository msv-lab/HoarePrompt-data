Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 4, `r` is `a[4] + k // 5`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions as described in the initial state.
