The value of `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the same, `a` is the same sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, and `k` is updated to `k - (n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])` and `k` is not 0.**
