Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
