The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4. The value of `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 4. If ((`i` + 1) * (`a[i + 1]` - `a[i]`) > `k`), then `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[4]`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - 4 * (a[5] - a[4])`, `rem` is either 0 or `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[5]`.**
