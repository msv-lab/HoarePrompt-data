Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)` again, so the new value of `cnt` is the previous `cnt` plus `math.floor(x / 2)` twice. The other variables remain unchanged.
