The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `a` is a list of integers. The execution of the code does not change the values of `t` or `a`; it only introduces a new variable `cnt` with the value 0.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is 0.**
