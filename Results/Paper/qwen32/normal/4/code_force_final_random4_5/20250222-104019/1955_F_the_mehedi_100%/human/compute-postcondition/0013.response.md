To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to understand the calculation of `cnt`.

Given:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the calculation of `cnt` in the provided code snippet, it is given as part of the initial state).
- `a` is the original list of integers.
- `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`.

Let's break down the calculation of `cnt`:
- For each element `x` in the list `a`, we compute `math.floor(x / 2)`, which is the largest integer less than or equal to `x / 2`.
- We then sum up all these computed values to get `cnt`.

Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we can describe the value of `cnt` precisely based on the given information.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for all elements x in the list a)**
