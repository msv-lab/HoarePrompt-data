The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `l` was 2, so after the increment, `l` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 2, `end` is 1, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions given, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`, and `a[2]` is equal to `a[3]`, `le` is the length of `a`, `l` is 3, `st` is 3**.
