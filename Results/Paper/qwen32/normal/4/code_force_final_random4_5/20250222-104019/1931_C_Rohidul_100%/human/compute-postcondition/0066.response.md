The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `l` and the value `n - 1` to `r`. The other variables (`end`, `ans`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is 0, `end` is `n`, `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains `le - n`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new list of integers from input, `le` is the length of the new `a`, `l` is 0, `st` is `n`**
