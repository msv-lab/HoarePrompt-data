The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now `l + 1`. The condition that `r` must be greater than `l + 1` is still valid, but since `l` has increased by 1, the new condition is that `r` must be greater than the new `l + 1`. The condition that `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]` is also still valid but now refers to the new value of `l`.

Output State: **`l` is increased by 2, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, and `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`.**
