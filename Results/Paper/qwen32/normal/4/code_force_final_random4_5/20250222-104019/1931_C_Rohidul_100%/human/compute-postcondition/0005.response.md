The code snippet assigns the values `1` to both `st` and `end`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, and `r` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value input by the user, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1.**
