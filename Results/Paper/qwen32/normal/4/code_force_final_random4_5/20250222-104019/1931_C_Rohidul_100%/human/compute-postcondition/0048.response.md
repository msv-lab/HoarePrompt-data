Output State: **`r` is `n - 1`, `end` is `1`, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions given, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers such that `a[n] == a[n - 1]`, `le` is the length of `a` and `le` must be at least `n + 1`, `l` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n`**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, making it `n - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
