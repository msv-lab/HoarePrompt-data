To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop header:

```
while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:

1. **Condition `l < r`:**
   - `l` is currently 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - For the condition `l < r` to be true, `n` must be at least 2 (since `r` would then be 1, and `l < r` would be `0 < 1`).

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`:**
   - `l` is currently 0, so this condition becomes `a[0] == a[1]`.
   - For the loop to execute, the first two elements of the list `a` must be equal.

### Adjustments:

- **Adjust `n`:** Ensure that `n` is at least 2.
- **Adjust `a`:** Ensure that `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`.

### State Adjustment:

Given the conditions above, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 2 and ensure that the first two elements of the list `a` are equal.

State: **`r` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be at least 2), `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end + 1)`, `n` is an input integer (must be at least 2), `a` is a list of integers from the input (where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`), `le` is the length of `a`, `l` is 0, `st` is 1**

To simplify the state representation, we can specify that `n` must be at least 2 and `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`:

State: **`r` is `n - 1`, `end` is 1, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions given, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, `le` is the length of `a`, `l` is 0, `st` is 1**
