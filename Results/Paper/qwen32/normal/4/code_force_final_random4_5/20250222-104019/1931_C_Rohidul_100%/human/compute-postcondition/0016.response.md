To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the condition `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `l` is the index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]` or `l == r`.
- `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0.

The loop condition `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]` requires:
1. `r > l`: This means `r` must be greater than `l`.
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`: This means the elements at index `r` and `r - 1` must be equal.

Let's break this down:
- Since `l` is the index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]` or `l == r`, `l` is the point where the sequence of equal elements ends or `l` is equal to `r`.
- For the loop to execute, `r` must be greater than `l` and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

To ensure the loop executes:
- We need `r` to be greater than `l`.
- We need to ensure that `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

Given the constraints, we can adjust `r` to be greater than `l` and ensure that `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` are equal. Since `l` is defined as the point where the sequence of equal elements ends or `l == r`, we can set `r` to `l + 1` and ensure `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `r` to be `l + 1` and ensure that `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

State: **`l` is the index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]` or `l == r`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0, `r` is `l + 1`, and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`**
