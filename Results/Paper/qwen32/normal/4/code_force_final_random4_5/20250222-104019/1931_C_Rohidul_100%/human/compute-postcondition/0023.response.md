The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is initially `l + 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes equal to `l`. The values of `l`, `st`, `a[r]`, and `end` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is the index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]` or `l == r - 1`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0, `r` is `l`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `end` is incremented by 1**.
