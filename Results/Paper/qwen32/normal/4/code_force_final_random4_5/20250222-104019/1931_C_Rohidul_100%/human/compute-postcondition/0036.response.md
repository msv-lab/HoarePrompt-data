The code snippet assigns the values `1` to both `st` and `end`. The values of the other variables (`r`, `ans`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`r` is `n - 1`, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end + 1)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `le` is the length of `a`, `l` is 0, `st` is 1**.
