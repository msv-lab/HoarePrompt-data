The code snippet provided is `r -= 1`, which decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is `l + 1`. After decrementing `r`, the new value of `r` will be `l`.

The other variables (`l`, `st`, and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`) remain unchanged. The condition that `l` is the index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]` or `l == r` might need re-evaluation, but based on the given code snippet, only `r` is modified.

Output State: **`l` is the index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]` or `l == r`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0, `r` is `l`, and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.**
