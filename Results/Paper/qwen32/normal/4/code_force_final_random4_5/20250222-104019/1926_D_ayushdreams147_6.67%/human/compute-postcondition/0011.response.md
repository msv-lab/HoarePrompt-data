The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `num`, `count`) remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `res` is 2 or 1 depending on the previous iteration, `count` has been updated to increment the count of `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` by 1.**
