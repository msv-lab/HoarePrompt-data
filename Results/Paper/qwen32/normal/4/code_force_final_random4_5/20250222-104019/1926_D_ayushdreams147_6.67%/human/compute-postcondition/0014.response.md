The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a` and the variable `num`. Since `num` is the next element in the list `a` at the start of each iteration, `num` should be the next element in the list after the current `num` at the end of the previous iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the current element being processed from the list `a`. For the next iteration, `num` should be the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a`**.

Since `num` was the current element in the previous iteration, it should now be the subsequent element in the list for the next iteration. Therefore, if `num` was `a[i]` in the previous iteration, it should now be `a[i+1]`.

Given that we don't have the specific index `i` from the previous iteration, we can only express the state in terms of `num` being the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a`**.

To be more precise, if we assume `num` was `a[i]` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration `num` should be `a[i+1]`. However, without knowing `i`, we can't specify the exact next element, but we know it will be the subsequent element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a`**.
