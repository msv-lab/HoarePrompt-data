Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, i is t-1, n is the last input integer, k is the second last input integer, l is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have the value of `t-1`, which is the last iteration index. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` will reflect the data from the last set of inputs processed by the loop. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
