Correctness: **False**

The provided program always outputs `k - 1` for each test case, regardless of the input values. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left depends on the distribution of card numbers and cannot be determined solely by the value of `k`. The correct solution involves counting the frequency of each card number and using the formula to determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further through the described operations.
