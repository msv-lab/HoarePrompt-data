Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a specific range. The provided code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to `t`. Therefore, `t` will now hold the value of the input integer, which is still within the range 1 to 500. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
