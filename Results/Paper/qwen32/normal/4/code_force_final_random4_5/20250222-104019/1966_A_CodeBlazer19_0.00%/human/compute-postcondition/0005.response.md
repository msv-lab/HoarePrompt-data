Let's analyze the given task step by step.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it ranges from 0 to `t-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `t-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `l`) do not change their values in the loop head.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input.**
