You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. c is a list of n integers where each integer c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, i is t-1, n is the last input integer, k is the second last input integer, l is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. The program simply outputs `k - 1` for every test case, which is not the correct approach.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4

Expected Output:
2
```

Explanation for the example:
- We have 5 cards with numbers: [4, 1, 1, 4, 4].
- We can perform the operation once by choosing the three cards with the number 4.
- After the operation, we replace these three cards with two cards, which can be any numbers.
- Now we have 3 cards left: [1, 1, x, x] (where x can be any number).
- We can perform the operation again by choosing the two cards with the number 1.
- After the operation, we replace these two cards with one card.
- Now we have 2 cards left: [x, x] (where x can be any number).

Thus, the minimum number of cards left is 2.

However, the provided program will output `3 - 1 = 2` for this case, which is correct in this specific instance, but this does not mean the program is correct for all cases. Let's consider another example where the program will fail:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
10 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Expected Output:
3
```

Explanation for the example:
- We have 10 cards with numbers: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
- We can perform the operation twice by choosing four cards each time.
- After the first operation, we replace these four cards with three cards.
- Now we have 9 cards left: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, x, x, x] (where x can be any number).
- After the second operation, we replace these four cards with three cards.
- Now we have 8 cards left: [1, 1, 1, x, x, x, x, x] (where x can be any number).
- We can perform the operation again by choosing four cards.
- After the third operation, we replace these four cards with three cards.
- Now we have 7 cards left: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x] (where x can be any number).
- We can perform the operation again by choosing four cards.
- After the fourth operation, we replace these four cards with three cards.
- Now we have 6 cards left: [x, x, x, x, x, x] (where x can be any number).
- We can perform the operation again by choosing four cards.
- After the fifth operation, we replace these four cards with three cards.
- Now we have 5 cards left: [x, x, x, x, x] (where x can be any number).
- We can perform the operation again by choosing four cards.
- After the sixth operation, we replace these four cards with three cards.
- Now we have 4 cards left: [x, x, x, x] (where x can be any number).
- We can perform the operation again by choosing four cards.
- After the seventh operation, we replace these four cards with three cards.
- Now we have 3 cards left: [x, x, x] (where x can be any number).

Thus, the minimum number of cards left is 3.

However, the provided program will output `4 - 1 = 3` for this case, which is correct in this specific instance, but the logic is incorrect for other cases. The program should count the frequency of each card, and then for each frequency, determine how many cards will be left after performing the operations optimally. The provided program does not do this and instead just outputs `k - 1` for every test case, which is not the correct approach.
