The code snippet provided updates the list `l` by reading a new line of input, splitting it into components, and mapping each component to an integer. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input.**

In natural language: The list `l` is now a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
