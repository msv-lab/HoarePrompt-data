### Reasoning:

The program defines a function `func_1` that generates a permutation for each test case. The function reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the permutation. It then creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`. The list is then modified such that the elements at even indices are reversed, while the elements at odd indices remain unchanged. The modified list is then printed as the output.

Let's analyze if the generated permutation satisfies the problem's condition:
- The condition requires that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

The permutation generated by the program follows a specific pattern:
- Elements at even indices are reversed.
- Elements at odd indices remain in their original order.

Let's consider an example:
For `n = 4`, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After modifying the list by reversing the elements at even indices, we get `[1, 4, 3, 2]`.

Let's verify the condition for this permutation:
- For `i = 1` and `j = 3`, `p_1 = 1` and `p_3 = 3`. `p_2 = 4` and `p_4 = 2`. Here, `p_1` divides `p_3` but `p_2` does not divide `p_4`.
- For `i = 1` and `j = 2`, `p_1 = 1` and `p_3 = 3`. `p_2 = 4` and `p_3 = 3`. Here, `p_1` divides `p_3` but `p_2` does not divide `p_3`.
- For `i = 2` and `j = 4`, `p_2 = 4` and `p_4 = 2`. `p_3 = 3` and `p_5` does not exist. Here, `p_2` does not divide `p_4` and `p_3` does not divide `p_5`.

This pattern holds for any `n`. The elements at even indices are reversed, and the elements at odd indices remain in their original order. This ensures that for any two indices `i` and `j`, the condition `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` is not satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation for each test case that satisfies the problem's condition.
