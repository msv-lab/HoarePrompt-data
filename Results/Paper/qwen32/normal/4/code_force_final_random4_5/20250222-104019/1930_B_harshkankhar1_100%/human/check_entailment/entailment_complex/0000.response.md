### Reasoning:

The program is supposed to generate a permutation \( p \) for each test case such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

Let's analyze the provided solution:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))  # Create a list [1, 2, 3, ..., n]
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]  # Reverse the elements at even indices
    print(*a)
```

The function `func_1` generates a permutation by reversing the elements at even indices. Let's consider why this approach might work:

1. **Permutation Validity**: The list `a` initially contains all integers from 1 to \( n \). By reversing the elements at even indices, we still have a permutation because we are rearranging the same elements without duplication.

2. **Condition Analysis**: The key condition is to ensure that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

   - When we reverse the elements at even indices, we are essentially creating a specific pattern that disrupts the straightforward divisibility relationships that might exist in a simple increasing or decreasing sequence.
   
   - For example, for \( n = 4 \), the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the even indices, we get `[1, 4, 3, 2]`. Here, no pair of elements \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) satisfies the divisibility condition.

3. **Generalization**: This pattern holds for any \( n \geq 3 \). Reversing the even indices ensures that the elements are arranged in a way that avoids the divisibility condition mentioned in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution meets the requirements of the problem by generating a permutation that avoids the specified divisibility condition. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
