Output State: **`t` is 0, and the loop has finished executing all test cases.**

In natural language, this means that after all the specified test cases (as determined by the initial value of `t`) have been processed, the loop terminates because `t` has been decremented to 0. No more iterations of the loop will occur, and the program will proceed to its next steps or terminate if there are no further instructions.
