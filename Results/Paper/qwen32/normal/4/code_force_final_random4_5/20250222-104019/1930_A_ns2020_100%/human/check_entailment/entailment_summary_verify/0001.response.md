### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves selecting pairs of numbers from a list of `2n` integers, adding the smaller number from each pair to the score, and erasing both numbers. The goal is to maximize the score after `n` such moves.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available numbers together. This ensures that the smaller number in each pair (which gets added to the score) is as large as possible compared to other possible pairings.
   - Sorting the list of numbers in ascending order allows us to easily pick the smallest numbers for pairing. By summing every second element from the sorted list (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, ...), we effectively sum the smaller elements of each pair.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The provided code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, ...) and prints this sum.
   - The process is repeated for all test cases.

4. **Verification with Example:**
   - For the first test case (`n=1`, numbers `2 3`):
     - After sorting, the array is `2 3`.
     - Sum of every second element starting from the first is `2`.
     - The score is `2`, which is correct.
   - For the second test case (`n=2`, numbers `1 1 2 1`):
     - After sorting, the array is `1 1 1 2`.
     - Sum of every second element starting from the first is `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - The score is `2`, which is correct.
   - For the third test case (`n=3`, numbers `1 1 1 1 1 1`):
     - After sorting, the array is `1 1 1 1 1 1`.
     - Sum of every second element starting from the first is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
     - The score is `3`, which is correct.

5. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary aligns with the implementation and the optimal strategy. It correctly states that the function sorts the list and computes the sum of elements at even indices, which corresponds to summing the smaller elements of each pair.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score by summing the smallest elements in each pair after sorting the array. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
