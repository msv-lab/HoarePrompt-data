The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these elements to an integer, and then stores them in a list named `A`. The variables `t` and `n` are not modified by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an input integer; `A` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers.**
