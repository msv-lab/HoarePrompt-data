The code snippet assigns a new value to `A` by reading a line of input, splitting it into components, converting each component to an integer, and then collecting these integers into a list. The initial state specifies that `A` was a sorted list of integers, but this precondition is overwritten by the new assignment. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
