Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is an input integer. This integer could be related to the length of list `A`, but it's not explicitly stated in the initial state. We will assume it is the length of `A` for the context of the problem.
- `A` is a sorted list of integers.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

**Explanation:**
- `A[::2]` is a slice of the list `A` that takes every second element starting from the first element (index 0). This means it includes elements at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, and so on.
- `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these elements.

**Output Description:**
The print statement will output the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list `A`.

Since the exact values of the list `A` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list `A`.

**Final Output:**
Output: **sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list `A`**
