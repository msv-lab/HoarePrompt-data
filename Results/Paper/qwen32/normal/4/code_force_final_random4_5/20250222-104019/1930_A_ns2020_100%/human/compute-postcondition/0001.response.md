To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the loop condition and the variables involved in it.

The given `while` loop is:
```python
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy. The initial state provided is that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).

Since `t` is already given to be within the range 1 to 5000, it is guaranteed to be non-zero and thus truthy. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000**
