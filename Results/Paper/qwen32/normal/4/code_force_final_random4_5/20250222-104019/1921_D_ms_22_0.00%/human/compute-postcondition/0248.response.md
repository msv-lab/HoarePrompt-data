Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two lists of integers, `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances between each element in list `a` and the closest elements in list `b`, considering both the smallest and largest elements in `b` as potential closest points. The function outputs the result for each test case.**
