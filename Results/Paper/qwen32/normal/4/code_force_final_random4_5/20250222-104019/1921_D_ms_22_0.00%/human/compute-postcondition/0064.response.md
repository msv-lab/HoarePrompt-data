Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining. The variable `ans` has been increased by `diff`. `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `tp2` is reduced by 1. All other variables maintain their initial states.
