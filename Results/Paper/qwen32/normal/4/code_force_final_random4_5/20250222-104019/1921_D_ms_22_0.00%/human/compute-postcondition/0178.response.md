Output State: **`max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, where `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])` and `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The `max_heap` now contains a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. The values of `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged.
