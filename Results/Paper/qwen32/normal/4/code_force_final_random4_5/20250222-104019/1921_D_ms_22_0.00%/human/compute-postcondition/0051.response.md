Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `diff`, `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with the largest `diff` removed, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was removed from `max_heap`, and `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`.**
