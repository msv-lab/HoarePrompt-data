Given the initial state, here's the breakdown of the variables and objects:

- `max_heap` is empty, which means it does not contain any elements.
- `tp1` and `tp2` have moved towards each other, but their exact values or the context of their movement is not provided.
- `ans` contains the sum of the differences, but the exact differences that were summed are not provided.
- `t` is non-positive, meaning its value is either zero or a negative number.

The print statement is:

```
print(ans)
```

Since the exact value of `ans` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of what it represents. `ans` is the sum of the differences, and we don't have the specific differences or the exact sum.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the differences)**
