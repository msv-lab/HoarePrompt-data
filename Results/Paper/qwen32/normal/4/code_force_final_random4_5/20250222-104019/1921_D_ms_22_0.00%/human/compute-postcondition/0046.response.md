The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the negation of the first element of the tuple `item` to it. The tuple `item` is structured as `(-diff, i, j)`, so `-item[0]` is essentially `diff`.

Given that `item` is a tuple that has been removed from `max_heap` and `item[0]` is `-diff`, the value of `ans` will be incremented by `diff`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `diff`, `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with the largest `diff` removed, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was removed from `max_heap`, and `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`.**
