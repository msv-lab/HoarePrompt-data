Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`; `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp1` is increased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1. All other variables, including `max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, and `diff2`, remain unchanged.
