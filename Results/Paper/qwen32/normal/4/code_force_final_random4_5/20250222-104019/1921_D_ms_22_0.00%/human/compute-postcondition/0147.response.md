Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`; `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2 - 1])` if `diff1 <= diff2`, otherwise `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp1` is increased by 1 if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `tp2` is decreased by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff1` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1` or `tp2`, `ans` is increased by `difference`; `tp1` is increased by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, otherwise `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
