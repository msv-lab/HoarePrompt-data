The code snippet `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. The other variables (`max_heap`, `item`, `ans`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`; `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value; `ans` is increased by `difference`; `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
