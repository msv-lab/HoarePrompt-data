The code snippet calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the sorted list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`**.
