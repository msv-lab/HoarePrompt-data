The given Python code snippet uses the `heapq.heappush` function to push a tuple into a max-heap. The tuple contains the negative of `diff2`, the current element `i` from list `a`, and the index `m - 1` from list `b`. This operation affects the `max_heap` by adding the new tuple to it, but since `max_heap` is not part of the initial state, we only need to reflect the change in the heap structure in our output state.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only variable that is directly impacted is `max_heap`. However, since `max_heap` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we will describe its new state in terms of the tuple that was pushed onto it.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**.

In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition that `max_heap` now contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.
