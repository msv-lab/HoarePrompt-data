Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining. The tuple `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was removed from `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code snippet removes the top element from `max_heap` and assigns it to `item`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, or the remaining elements in `max_heap`. The only change is the assignment of the removed tuple to `item`.
