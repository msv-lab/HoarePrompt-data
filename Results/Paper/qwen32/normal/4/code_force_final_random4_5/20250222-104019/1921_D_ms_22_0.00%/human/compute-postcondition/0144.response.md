Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`; `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value; `ans` is increased by `difference`; `tp1` is increased by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1. All other variables, including `max_heap`, `item`, and `ans`, remain unchanged from their initial state.
