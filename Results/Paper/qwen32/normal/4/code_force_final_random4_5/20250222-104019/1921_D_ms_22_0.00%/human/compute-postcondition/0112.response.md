Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains `[(-diff1, i, 0), (-diff2, i, m - 1), (-diff1, i, 0)]` if `diff1` is not equal to `diff2`, or `[(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1), (-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1), (-diff1, i, 0), (-diff1, i, 0)]` if `diff1` is equal to `diff2`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is `a[next_index]`; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` also contains an additional `(-diff1, i, 0)`; otherwise, it contains an additional `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.**

To simplify: **`max_heap` contains `[(-diff1, i, 0), (-diff2, i, m - 1)]` plus an additional `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is not greater than `diff2`. All other variables (`tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `diff1`, `diff2`) retain their initial values.**
