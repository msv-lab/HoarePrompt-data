The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the current element `i` from list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `b`, and assigns this value to `diff2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**
