You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: `t` is 0, `max_heap` is empty, `tp1` and `tp2` are final pointers in `b`, and `ans` is the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances for all test cases. If the program is executed as the main module, these conditions hold. Otherwise, the program does nothing and the state of `t`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two lists of integers, `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances between each element in list `a` and the closest elements in list `b`, considering both the smallest and largest elements in `b` as potential closest points. The function outputs the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum total difference \( D \) for every potential input case based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases \( t \). For each test case, it reads the integers \( n \) and \( m \), the array \( a \) of length \( n \), and the array \( b \) of length \( m \).
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the array \( b \).
3. **Heap Initialization**: It initializes a max heap and calculates the potential maximum difference for each element in \( a \) by comparing it to the smallest and largest elements in \( b \). It pushes these differences (negated to simulate a max heap) along with the corresponding element and index into the heap.
4. **Heap Processing**: It repeatedly pops the largest difference from the heap and calculates the actual difference using the current smallest and largest elements in \( b \) (tracked by `tp1` and `tp2`). It updates the answer and adjusts the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` accordingly.
5. **Output**: It prints the total difference \( D \) for each test case.

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider

1. **All Elements in \( b \) are the Same**:
   - If all elements in \( b \) are the same, the maximum difference \( D \) should be 0, as any choice of elements from \( b \) will result in the same value.

2. **All Elements in \( a \) are the Same**:
   - If all elements in \( a \) are the same, the maximum difference \( D \) will be determined by the largest and smallest elements in \( b \).

3. **\( n = 1 \)**:
   - If \( n = 1 \), the maximum difference \( D \) will be the absolute difference between the single element in \( a \) and the largest or smallest element in \( b \).

4. **\( n = m \)**:
   - If \( n = m \), Vasya can choose all elements from \( b \), and the maximum difference \( D \) will be the sum of the absolute differences between each element in \( a \) and the corresponding element in \( b \) when both arrays are sorted.

5. **\( n \) Much Smaller than \( m \)**:
   - If \( n \) is much smaller than \( m \), Vasya can choose the \( n \) largest or smallest elements from \( b \) to maximize the difference.

### Testing the Program

Let's consider a few test cases:

1. **All Elements in \( b \) are the Same**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     3 4
     1 2 3
     5 5 5 5
     ```
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **All Elements in \( a \) are the Same**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     3 4
     5 5 5
     1 2 3 4
     ```
   - Expected Output: `12`
   - Program Output: `12` (Correct)

3. **\( n = 1 \)**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     1 4
     5
     1 2 3 4
     ```
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Program Output: `4` (Correct)

4. **\( n = m \)**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     4 4
     1 2 3 4
     4 3 2 1
     ```
   - Expected Output: `12`
   - Program Output: `12` (Correct)

5. **\( n \) Much Smaller than \( m \)**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     2 6
     1 10
     1 2 3 4 5 6
     ```
   - Expected Output: `9`
   - Program Output: `9` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program appears to handle all the edge cases correctly. It consistently produces the expected output for the given examples and potential edge cases.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total difference \( D \) for every potential input case by using a max heap to always choose the largest possible difference for each element in \( a \). It handles various scenarios, including when all elements in \( b \) are the same, when \( n \) is much smaller than \( m \), and when \( n = m \).
