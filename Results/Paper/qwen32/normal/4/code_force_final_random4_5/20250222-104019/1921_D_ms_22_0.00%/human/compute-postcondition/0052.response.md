Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with the largest `diff` removed. The tuple `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `diff1` is calculated as `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])` if `diff1 > diff2` else `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `tp1` is updated to `tp1 + 1` if `diff1 > diff2` else 0, `tp2` is updated to `m - 1` if `diff1 > diff2` else `m - 2`, and `ans` is updated to `diff1` if `diff1 > diff2` else `ans + diff2`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the previous value of `ans` plus `diff`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`.**
