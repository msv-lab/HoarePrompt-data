Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining. The variable `ans` has been increased by `diff`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` has been decreased by 1.**
