The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element in `a`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_next`, which means the loop has just processed `i_next`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the list `a` to be processed. Let's denote this next element as `i_next_next`.

State: **`max_heap` is not empty and contains either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, along with the new element `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `diff1` is `abs(i_next - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i_next - b[m - 1])`, `i` is `i_next_next`**
