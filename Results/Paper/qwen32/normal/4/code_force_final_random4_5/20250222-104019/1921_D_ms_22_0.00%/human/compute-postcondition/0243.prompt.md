Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_heap` is not empty and contains tuples in the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `index` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on whether `diff` is `abs(i - b[0])` or `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_heap` contains tuples in the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, except for the one that was popped; `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, and if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is set to 1, `tp2` is set to `m - 1`, and `ans` is set to `diff1`; otherwise, `tp1` is set to 0, `tp2` is set to `m - 2`, and `ans` is updated to the previous value of `ans` plus `diff2`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is updated to 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`; otherwise, `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`. Additionally, if `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated to `ans + item[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated by adding the positive value of `item[0]` to it. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2`, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]` (which is `diff`). If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
