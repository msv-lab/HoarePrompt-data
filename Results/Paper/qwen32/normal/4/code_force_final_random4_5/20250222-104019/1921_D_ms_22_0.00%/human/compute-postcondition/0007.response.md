The code snippet sorts the list `b`. Therefore, the list `b` will now contain the same integers but in ascending order. The other variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split substring to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting a new input string, converting each split substring to an integer, and sorting the resulting list in ascending order.**
