The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the positive value of `item[0]` to it, since `item[0]` is `-diff` and we are negating it with `-item[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after the removal, the output state will reflect the updated value of `ans` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated by adding the positive value of `item[0]` to it.**
