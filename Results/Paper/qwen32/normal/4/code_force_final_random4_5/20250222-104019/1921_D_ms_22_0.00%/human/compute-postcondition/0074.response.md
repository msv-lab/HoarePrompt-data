Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining, except one tuple has been removed. The variable `ans` has been increased by `diff2`. The variable `item` is assigned the value of the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`. `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `diff2` to it. The variable `tp2` has been decremented by 1, and no other variables have been changed from their previously described states.
