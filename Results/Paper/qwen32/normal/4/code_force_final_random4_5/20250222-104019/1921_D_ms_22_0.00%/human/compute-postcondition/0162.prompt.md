Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_heap` contains all the calculated differences for each element in `a` as tuples `(-difference, i, index)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` (one less than before), `tp1` is 1 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2` or `tp1 + 1` if `item[2]` was equal to `tp1`, otherwise `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2` or `item[2]` was equal to `tp1`, otherwise `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `ans + diff1` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `ans` is `ans + diff2` if `item[2]` is not between `tp1` and `tp2`, and `ans + -item[0]` otherwise, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, and `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`; `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2 - 1])` if `diff1 <= diff2`, otherwise `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp1` is increased by 1 if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `tp2` is decreased by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff1` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1` or `tp2`, `ans` is increased by `difference`; `tp1` is increased by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, otherwise `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` after the smallest element has been removed; `item` is the removed tuple `(-difference, i, index)` with the largest `difference`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])` and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `difference`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp2`, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `difference`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
