The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` modifies the variable `ans` by adding the positive value of the first element of the tuple `item` (since `item[0]` is `-diff`, `-item[0]` is `diff`). This means `ans` will increase by the `diff` value of the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`.

The other variables (`max_heap`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `item`) remain unchanged in terms of their values or state as per the initial conditions provided.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]` (which is `diff`).**
