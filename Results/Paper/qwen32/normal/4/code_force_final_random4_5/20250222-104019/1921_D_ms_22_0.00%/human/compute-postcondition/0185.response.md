The code snippet pushes a new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto the `max_heap`. This means the `max_heap` now includes this new tuple in addition to the elements it previously contained. The other variables (`tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `diff1`, `diff2`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` is not empty and contains either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, along with the new element `(-diff1, i, 0)`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is `i_next`.**
