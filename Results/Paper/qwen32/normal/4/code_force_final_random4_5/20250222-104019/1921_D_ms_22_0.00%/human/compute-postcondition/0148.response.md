The only object in the loop head is `max_heap`, so we need to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty for the loop to execute one more time. Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is that `max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`, we need to ensure that `max_heap` still contains at least one element for the next iteration.

Since the loop condition is simply `while max_heap:`, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty. No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head.

State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`**
