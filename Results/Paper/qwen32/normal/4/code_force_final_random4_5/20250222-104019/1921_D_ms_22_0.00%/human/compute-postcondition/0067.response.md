The `while` loop in the given code continues as long as `max_heap` is not empty. The loop head only involves the `max_heap` variable. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `max_heap` still contains at least one tuple.

Given that the problem states that `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that this condition holds true for the next iteration.

Since no operations are specified that would remove the last element from `max_heap` in the description, we can assume that `max_heap` still contains at least one tuple after the previous iteration. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the state of `max_heap` to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining. The variable `ans` has been increased by either `diff1` or `diff` depending on the condition. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is calculated as `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`. `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff`.**
