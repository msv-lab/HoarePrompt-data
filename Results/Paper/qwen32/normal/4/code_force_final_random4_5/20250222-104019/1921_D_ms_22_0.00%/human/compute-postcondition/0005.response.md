Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split substring to an integer.**

Explanation: The value of `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element in the list corresponds to an integer from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
