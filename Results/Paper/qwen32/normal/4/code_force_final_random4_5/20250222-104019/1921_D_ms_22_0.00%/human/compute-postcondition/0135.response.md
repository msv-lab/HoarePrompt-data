The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes the smallest element from the `max_heap` (which, due to the negative sign in the tuples, effectively pops the largest `difference` value) and assigns it to the variable `item`. The `max_heap` will have one less element after this operation. The precondition that `max_heap` contains at least one tuple remains valid, but now it contains one less tuple than before.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` (if it originally had more than one tuple); `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value.**
