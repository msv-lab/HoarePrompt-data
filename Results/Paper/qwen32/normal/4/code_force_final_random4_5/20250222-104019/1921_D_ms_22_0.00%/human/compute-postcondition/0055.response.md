The code calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` and assigns it to `diff1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining. The tuple `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was removed from `max_heap`. `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`.**
