Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The `max_heap` still contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value was removed. The variable `t` has been decremented by `n` and is still greater than 0. The variables `n` and `m` remain the integers read from the input, `a` remains the list of integers read from the input, and `b` remains the sorted list of integers read from the input. The variable `item` holds the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`. A new variable `diff1` is introduced and is assigned the value of `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`.
