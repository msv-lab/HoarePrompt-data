Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Vasya wants to create an array `c` of length `n` from `m` given integers `b` such that the total difference `D = Î£|a_i - c_i|` is maximized.

### Strategy:
To maximize the total difference, Vasya should ideally pair each element `a_i` with the largest or smallest possible element from `b` that hasn't been used yet. This is because the absolute difference `|a_i - b_j|` is maximized when `b_j` is either the smallest or the largest possible value from `b`.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `b` is sorted. This allows easy access to the smallest and largest elements of `b`.

3. **Heap Usage:**
   - A max heap (using negative values to simulate a max heap in Python) is used to keep track of the maximum possible differences for each element `a_i`.
   - For each `a_i`, the program calculates the potential differences with the smallest and largest elements of `b` and pushes the larger difference (along with `a_i` and the corresponding `b` index) into the heap.

4. **Maximizing Differences:**
   - The program pops elements from the heap and calculates the actual difference using the smallest or largest unused element from `b`.
   - It ensures that the same `b` index is not reused by maintaining pointers `tp1` and `tp2` for the smallest and largest unused elements of `b`.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the total maximum difference `D`.

### Correctness:
The strategy and implementation seem correct. The program efficiently calculates the maximum possible total difference by leveraging the sorted order of `b` and a max heap to always consider the largest possible difference for each `a_i`. The use of pointers `tp1` and `tp2` ensures that each element of `b` is used at most once.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
