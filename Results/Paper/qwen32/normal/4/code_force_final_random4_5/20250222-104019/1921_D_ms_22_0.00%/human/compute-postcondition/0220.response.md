Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp1` is incremented by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff1`.**

In simple terms, the variable `ans` has been updated by adding the value of `diff1` to it. All other variables retain their previous states.
