Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains tuples in the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, except for the one that was popped; `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, and if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is set to 1, `tp2` is set to `m - 1`, and `ans` is set to `diff1`; otherwise, `tp1` is set to 0, `tp2` is set to `m - 2`, and `ans` is updated to the previous value of `ans` plus `diff2`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is updated to 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`; otherwise, `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`. Additionally, if `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated to `ans + item[0]`.**
