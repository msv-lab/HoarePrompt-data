Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `L` is a list with at least two elements, `a` is the second element of `L`; `pow` is 4; `m` is 1; `tot` is `tot + 2*a`; `k` is `k - tot`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as described.**

Explanation: The value of `pow` is doubled, so it changes from 2 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
