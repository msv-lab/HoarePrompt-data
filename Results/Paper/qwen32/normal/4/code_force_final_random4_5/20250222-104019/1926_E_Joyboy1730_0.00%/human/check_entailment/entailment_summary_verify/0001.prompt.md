You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n. It then calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Vladislav lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.
2. Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest.
3. Then, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number, and so on.
4. We need to find the k-th card laid down in this sequence.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` (the total number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to find).
3. It initializes an empty list `L` and enters a while loop that seems to calculate something related to the total number of cards, but the list `L` is never populated, and the loop doesn't affect the logic for finding the k-th card.
4. It initializes `tot` (total count of cards laid down so far) and `pow` (a multiplier used to determine the sequence of cards).
5. It iterates over the empty list `L`, which means the body of the loop will never execute.
6. The logic inside the loop, if executed, would determine the k-th card based on the multiplier `pow` and the current position `k`, but since `L` is empty, the loop is skipped entirely.

### Issues in the Program:
- The list `L` is never populated, so the loop that should determine the k-th card never runs.
- The logic to determine the k-th card is inside the loop, which is never executed.
- The program doesn't correctly implement the logic to find the k-th card based on the described sequence.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Determine the number of odd cards that can be laid down.
2. Determine the number of cards that are twice an odd number, and so on.
3. Use this information to find the k-th card in the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the k-th card in the sequence as described in the problem. Therefore, it is incorrect.
