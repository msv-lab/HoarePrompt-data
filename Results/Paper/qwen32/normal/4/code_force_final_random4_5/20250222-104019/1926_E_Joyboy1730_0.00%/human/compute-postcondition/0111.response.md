Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `L` is a list with at least three elements, `a` is the third element of `L`; `pow` is 4; `m` is 1; `tot` is `tot + 2*a`; `k` is `k - tot`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `L`, `a`, `pow`, `m`, `tot`, and `k` remain as described in the initial state, but the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
