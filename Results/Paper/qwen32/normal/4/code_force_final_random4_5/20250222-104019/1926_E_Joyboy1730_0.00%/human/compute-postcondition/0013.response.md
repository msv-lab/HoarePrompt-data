To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop:

The loop is defined as:
```python
while n:
    m = (n + 1) // 2
    n -= m
```
This loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, and then `n` is decremented by `m`.

The key observation here is that `m` is always at least half of `n` (rounded up if `n` is odd). Therefore, `n` is reduced by at least half in each iteration. This process continues until `n` becomes 0.

Let's break down the process:
1. In the first iteration, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2` and `n` becomes `n - m`.
2. In the second iteration, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2` (where `n` is the new value from the first iteration) and `n` becomes `n - m`.
3. This continues until `n` is reduced to 0.

Given the initial state `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the loop will execute until `n` becomes 0. At that point, the loop terminates, and the final state of `n` will be 0.

The variables `t` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The list `L` remains empty as no operations are performed on it within the loop.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `L` is an empty list.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, `n` will be 0, while `t` and `k` retain their initial values, and the list `L` remains empty.
