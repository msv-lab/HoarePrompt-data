The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. Given that `n` is 1, the calculation becomes `(1 + 1) // 2`, which equals 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` is 1; `k` is the value provided by the input; `L` is []; `pow` is 1; `tot` is 0; `m` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` is 1; `k` is the value provided by the input; `L` is []; `pow` is 1; `tot` is 0; `m` is 1.**
