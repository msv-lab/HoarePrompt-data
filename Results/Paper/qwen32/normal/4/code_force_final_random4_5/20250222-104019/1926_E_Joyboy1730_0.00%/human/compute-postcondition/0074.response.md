Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 0 and `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is 0; `k` is `k - 2*tot`; `L` is a list with at least one element; `pow` is 4 times its previous value; `tot` is `tot + a`; `a` is the next element in the list `L`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
