The provided code snippet reassigns the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`, but since `m` was already initialized with the same value in the Initial State, the value of `m` remains unchanged. Therefore, the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` > 1; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
