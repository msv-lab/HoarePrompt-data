The value of `n` is decreased by `m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` > 1 and `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
