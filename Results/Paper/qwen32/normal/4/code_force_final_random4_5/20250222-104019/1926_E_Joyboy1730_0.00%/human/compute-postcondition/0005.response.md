The variable `m` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `L` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
