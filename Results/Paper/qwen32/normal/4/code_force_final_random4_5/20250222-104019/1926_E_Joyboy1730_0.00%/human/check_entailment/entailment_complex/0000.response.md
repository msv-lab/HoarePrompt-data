### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Initialization of `L`**: The list `L` is initialized as an empty list, but it's never populated with any values. The program does not calculate or store the number of cards that fall into each category (odd numbers, twice an odd number, etc.).

2. **While loop**: The while loop is intended to calculate the number of cards in each category and store these counts in `L`. However, the current implementation of the loop does not achieve this. It simply reduces `n` by `m` repeatedly, but `m` is not used to populate `L`.

3. **Main logic**: The main logic for determining the `k`-th card is flawed. It assumes `L` contains the counts of cards in each category, but since `L` is empty, the loop that processes `L` will not execute as intended. The program attempts to calculate the `k`-th card using the values in `L`, but since `L` is empty, it will never find a match and will not print a result.

4. **Output**: The program is supposed to print the `k`-th card for each test case, but due to the issues mentioned above, it does not correctly compute the `k`-th card.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
