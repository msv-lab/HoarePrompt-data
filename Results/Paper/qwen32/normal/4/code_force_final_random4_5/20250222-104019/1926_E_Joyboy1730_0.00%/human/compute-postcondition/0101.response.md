The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Given the initial state, `pow` is initially 1. After executing the code, `pow` becomes 2. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is `k - (tot + a)`; `L` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element of `L`; `pow` is 2; `m` is 1; `tot` is `tot + a`.**
