To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variable `n` changes with each iteration.

The loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. In each iteration:
1. `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
2. `n` is decreased by `m`.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After the first iteration, `n` is decreased by `(n + 1) // 2`.
- After the second iteration, `n` becomes 1.
- After the third iteration, `n` becomes 0, and the loop terminates.

This indicates that the loop will terminate when `n` becomes 0. Since `n` is halved in each iteration (more precisely, reduced by approximately half), the loop will execute until `n` is reduced to 0.

Given the pattern observed, the final state of the loop will be when `n` is 0. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`, `pow`, `tot`, and `m` from the last iteration) remain unchanged except for `n`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is the value provided by the input; `L` is []; `pow` is 1; `tot` is 0; `m` is 1.**

In simple terms, the loop runs until `n` becomes 0, and all other variables remain as they were initially, except for `n` which is now 0.
