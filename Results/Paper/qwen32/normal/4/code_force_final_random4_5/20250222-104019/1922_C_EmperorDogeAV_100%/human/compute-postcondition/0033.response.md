The given code snippet modifies the value of `prog_cities[i]` by setting it to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. The values of `cities`, `forward`, and `cities[i]` are used to compute this new value for `prog_cities[i]`. The other variables (`m`, `x_i`, `y_i`, and the other elements of `prog_cities` if they exist) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `prog_cities[i]` is initially set to either `1` or `abs(forward - cities[i])` based on a condition. After executing the line `prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])`, the value of `prog_cities[i]` is explicitly set to `abs(forward - cities[i])`.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities, `m` is the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` are the queries. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros except `prog_cities[i]` which is `abs(forward - cities[i])`. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i > 0`, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`. If `i` is not greater than 0, `back` remains `-99999999999999999999`.**
