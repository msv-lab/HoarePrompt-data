Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their coordinates `cities`, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the cost to move to the closest city for each city, except the last one in the list.
   - The function iterates through the list of cities and determines whether the closest city is the next city (forward) or the previous city (backward).
   - If the closest city is forward, it assigns `1` to `prog_cities[i]`. Otherwise, it assigns the distance to the closest city (either forward or backward).

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The code calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward costs.
   - `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative cost to move from the first city to each city using the closest city rule.
   - `pref_sum_b` stores the cumulative cost to move from the last city to each city using the closest city rule.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(a, b)`, the code determines whether to use the forward or backward prefix sums based on the order of `a` and `b`.
   - It then calculates the cost as the difference in prefix sums between the indices of `b` and `a`.

### Analysis of the Code

#### 1. Closest City Calculation (`func_1`):
- The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the cost to move to the closest city for each city except the last one.
- However, there is a mistake in the logic:
  - When determining the closest city, it should compare the distances to both the previous and next cities and choose the closest one.
  - The code incorrectly assigns `1` to `prog_cities[i]` if the closest city is forward, but it should assign the actual distance to the closest city.
  - Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the city is the first one in the list correctly (it should only consider the next city).

#### 2. Prefix Sum Calculation:
- The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the incorrect closest city costs from `func_1`.
- Since the closest city costs are incorrect, the prefix sums will also be incorrect.

#### 3. Query Processing:
- The query processing logic assumes that the prefix sums correctly represent the cost to move between cities using the closest city rule.
- Since the prefix sums are incorrect, the results of the queries will also be incorrect.

### Conclusion
The code contains logical errors in the calculation of the closest city costs, which propagate to the prefix sums and, consequently, the query results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
