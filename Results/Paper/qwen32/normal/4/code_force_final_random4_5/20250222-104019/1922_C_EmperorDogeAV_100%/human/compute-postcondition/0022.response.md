The code snippet `prog_cities[i] = 1` sets the value at index `i` of the list `prog_cities` to 1. This change affects only the element at index `i` in the `prog_cities` list, while all other elements and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities, `m` is the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` are the queries; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros except `prog_cities[i]` which is 1. If `i` is greater than 0, `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i` is less than `n - 1`, otherwise `forward` is 999999999999999999. If `i` is 0, `back` is -999999999999999999 and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is `n - 1` or greater, `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` remains 999999999999999999. If `i` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `back` and `forward`. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is now `cities[i + 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the element at index `i` in the `prog_cities` list is now 1, while all other elements and variables remain the same.
