Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The `func_1` function is supposed to determine the closest city for each city, but it does not correctly handle the logic for determining the closest city. It only checks the immediate forward and backward cities, but it does not correctly handle the case where a city might have a closer city further away (though the problem guarantees unique closest cities for simplicity, the logic should still be correct).

2. **Pref Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum arrays (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are supposed to represent the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city from each city, but the calculation is flawed. The function `func_1` does not return the correct values for the closest cities, and thus the prefix sums are incorrect.

3. **Query Handling**: The program correctly handles the queries by checking if `a < b` or `a > b` and using the appropriate prefix sum array, but the prefix sums themselves are incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

To fix the program, the `func_1` function needs to be corrected to properly determine the closest city for each city. Additionally, the prefix sum arrays need to be recalculated based on the correct closest city information.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function and the main logic:

```python
def closest_cities(cities, n):
    closest = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i == 1 or (cities[i] - cities[i-1] < cities[i] - cities[closest[i-1]]):
            closest[i] = i-1
        else:
            closest[i] = closest[i-1]
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        if i == n-2 or (cities[i+1] - cities[i] < cities[closest[i+1]] - cities[i]):
            closest[i] = i+1
        else:
            closest[i] = closest[i+1]
    return closest

def calculate_cost(cities, closest, n):
    cost = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        cost[i] = cost[closest[i]] + 1
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        cost[i] = min(cost[i], cost[closest[i]] + 1)
    return cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    closest = closest_cities(cities, n)
    cost = calculate_cost(cities, closest, n)
    m = int(input())
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        a -= 1
        b -= 1
        total_cost = 0
        while a != b:
            if cost[a] <= cost[b]:
                total_cost += 1
                a = closest[a]
            else:
                total_cost += 1
                b = closest[b]
        print(total_cost)
```

This corrected version properly calculates the closest city for each city and then uses this information to calculate the minimum cost for each query.
