Functionality: **The function takes a list of city coordinates and determines for each city (except the last one) whether the next city is the closest city. If the next city is the closest, it marks that position in the result list with `1`. Otherwise, it stores the distance to the next city in the result list. The function returns this list of `n - 1` elements.**
