The given code snippet is `prog_cities[i] = 1`. This directly assigns the value `1` to the `i-th` element of the list `prog_cities`.

Given the initial state:
- `cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities.
- `m` is the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` are the queries.
- `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros except `prog_cities[i]` which is 1 if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`; otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is `abs(forward - cities[i])`. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i > 0`, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`. If `i` is not greater than 0, `back` remains `-99999999999999999999`.

The only change introduced by `prog_cities[i] = 1` is that the `i-th` element of `prog_cities` is now `1`. The rest of the variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities; `m` is the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` are the queries; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` elements where the `i-th` element is `1` and all other elements are unchanged.**
