Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities, `m` is the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` are the queries. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros except `prog_cities[i]` which is 1 if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`; otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is `abs(forward - cities[i])`. `i` is `n - 1`. `back` is -99999999999999999999.**

In natural language: The value of `back` has been set to -99999999999999999999. All other variables remain unchanged, including `cities`, `m`, `prog_cities`, and `i`.
