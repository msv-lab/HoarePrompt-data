The variable `back` is assigned the value of the sublist at index `i - 1` from the list `cities`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` (where `n` is at least 2) cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities, `m` as the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` as the queries; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros; `i` is greater than 0; `back` is `cities[i - 1]`; `forward` is 999999999999999999.**
