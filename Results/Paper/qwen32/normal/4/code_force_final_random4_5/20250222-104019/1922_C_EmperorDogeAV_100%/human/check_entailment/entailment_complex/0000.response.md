### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the cost of moving to the closest city for each city (except the last one) and storing this information in two lists: `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`. The `forward_cities` list stores the cost of moving to the closest city for each city when moving from left to right, and the `backward_cities` list stores the cost when moving from right to left.

The function `func_1` is responsible for generating these lists. It iterates through the list of cities and for each city (except the last one), it checks whether the next city is the closest city. If it is, it marks that position in the list with `1` (indicating that moving to the next city costs 1 coin). Otherwise, it stores the distance to the next city in the list.

After generating these lists, the program computes the prefix sums for both lists. The prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the total cost of moving from one city to another by summing up the costs stored in the prefix sum arrays.

For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (from a smaller index to a larger index or vice versa) and uses the appropriate prefix sum array to compute the minimum cost.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Incorrect Indexing in `func_1`:** In the `func_1` function, the forward and backward checks are incorrectly implemented. Specifically, the forward check should be `if i < n - 1:` and the backward check should be `if i > 0:`. However, the forward check is correct, but the backward check is unnecessary because `back` is only used if `i > 0`. The main issue is in the logic of determining the closest city. The code should compare the distance to the previous city with the distance to the next city correctly.

2. **Logic Error in `func_1`:** The logic inside `func_1` is flawed. The correct logic should be:
   - If `i == 0`, the closest city is the next city.
   - If `i == n-1`, the closest city is the previous city.
   - If `0 < i < n-1`, compare the distance to the previous city and the next city and choose the closest one.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:** The current implementation does not handle the cases where `i == 0` or `i == n-1` correctly. These cases need to be explicitly handled.

### Corrected `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if i == 0:
            prog_cities[i] = 1  # The closest city to the first city is the next city
        elif i == n - 2:
            prog_cities[i] = 1  # The closest city to the last city is the previous city
        else:
            back = cities[i - 1]
            forward = cities[i + 1]
            if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
                prog_cities[i] = 1
            else:
                prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities
```

### Conclusion:

Given the above issues, the original program is not correct as it does not handle the logic of determining the closest city correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
