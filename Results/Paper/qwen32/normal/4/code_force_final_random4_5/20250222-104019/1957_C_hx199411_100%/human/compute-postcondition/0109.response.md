Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `n`: An integer input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `k`: An integer input such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `t`: Initially at least 1, but has been decremented by 1. Therefore, `t` is 0 or a positive integer.
   - `i`: Initialized to -1.
   - `num`: The sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations, which can be expressed as `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`.
   - `m`: Calculated as `n - num` and is given to be 0.

2. **Given Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement directly outputs the integer `1`.
   - None of the variables `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `num`, or `m` are used in the print statement.
   - The value of `m` being 0 does not influence the output of this specific print statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the code is:
Output: **1**
