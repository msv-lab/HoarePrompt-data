The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r`. This means the values of `c` and `r` are updated based on the input, and no other variables are affected directly by this code snippet. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged unless the conditions involving `c` and `r` are met, which is not addressed in this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` and `r` are integers read from input, `num` is either 1 or 2 based on the condition, `i` is incremented by 1 if `c` does not equal `r`.**
