The given code snippet initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. This means that the list `dp` will have a length equal to `m + 1`, where `m` is calculated as `n - num`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each of the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
