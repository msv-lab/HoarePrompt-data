The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about various variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `num`, `m`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is solely determined by the `print(1)` statement itself.

Let's break down the given initial state to ensure we understand the context:
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
- `t` is at least 0.
- `i` is initialized to -1.
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations, plus the number of times `c != r`.
- `m` is calculated as `n - num` and is equal to 1.

However, none of these variables affect the `print(1)` statement, which simply outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **1**
