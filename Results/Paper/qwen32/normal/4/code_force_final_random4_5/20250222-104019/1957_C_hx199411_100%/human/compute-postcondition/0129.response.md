Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of size `n` and a series of `k` moves. For each move, it calculates a score based on whether the move is on the diagonal (`r_i == c_i`) or not. It then determines a value `m` which is the difference between `n` and the accumulated score. Depending on the value of `m`, it either outputs `1` if `m` is `0` or `1`, or computes a result using dynamic programming and outputs that result if `m` is greater than `1`.**
