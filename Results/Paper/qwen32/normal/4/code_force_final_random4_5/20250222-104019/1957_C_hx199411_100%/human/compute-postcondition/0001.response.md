To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the loop head condition. The `while` loop in your task is:

```python
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute as long as `t` is a non-zero value. Given the state right before the loop:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be in the range from 1 to 10,000, it will always be a non-zero value. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one time without any adjustments needed.

Following the instructions, we simply repeat the program state right before the loop:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
