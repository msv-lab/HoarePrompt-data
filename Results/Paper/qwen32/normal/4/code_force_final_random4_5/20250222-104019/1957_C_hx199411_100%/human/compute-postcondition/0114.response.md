The code snippet initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 0, `i` is -1, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`), `m` is `n - num` which is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, all initialized to 0.**
