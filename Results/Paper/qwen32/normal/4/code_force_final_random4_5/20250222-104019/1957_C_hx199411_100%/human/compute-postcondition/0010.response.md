Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers read from input. Additionally, `c` is not equal to `r`.**

The value of `num` has been incremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to 2. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
