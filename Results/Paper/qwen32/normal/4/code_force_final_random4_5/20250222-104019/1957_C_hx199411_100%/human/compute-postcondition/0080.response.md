Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 2, `i` is `k + 1`, `c` is the last first integer from the input, `r` is the last second integer from the input, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, and `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**

Explanation: The value of `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
