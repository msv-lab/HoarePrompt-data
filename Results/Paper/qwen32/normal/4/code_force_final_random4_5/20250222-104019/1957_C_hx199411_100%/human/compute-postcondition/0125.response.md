Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 0, `i` is either -1 or `m`, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`), and `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is equal to 1, then `i` remains -1. If `m` is at least 3, then `i` is set to `m`, and `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 3, and the rest are computed by the loop as `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).`**
