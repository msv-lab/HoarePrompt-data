The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 1, so now `j` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5 and `m` is at least 2; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input with `b[0]` not equal to `a[0]` and `b[1]` not equal to `a[1]`; `k` is 0; `j` is 2**
