Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is the index where `b[j] == a[1]` (if a match is found). The current value of `j` is less than `m`; `k` is increased by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `k` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
