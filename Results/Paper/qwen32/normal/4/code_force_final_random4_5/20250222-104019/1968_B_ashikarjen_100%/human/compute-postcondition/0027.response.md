Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length m read from the input; `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` and `j < m`; `k` is 1; `i` is 0.**
