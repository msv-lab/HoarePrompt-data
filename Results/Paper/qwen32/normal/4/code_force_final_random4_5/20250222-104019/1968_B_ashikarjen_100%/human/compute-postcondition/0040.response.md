To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the conditions under which the loop terminates. The loop continues to execute as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`. Since `i` is 1 and remains unchanged throughout the loop, the loop will terminate when either `j` reaches `m` or `b[j]` becomes equal to `a[1]`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we know that `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[1]`. This means that if `m` is greater than 3, the loop will continue until either `b[j]` equals `a[1]` or `j` reaches `m`.

Therefore, the final output state will be one of the following:
1. `j` reaches `m` and the loop terminates without finding a match for `a[1]` in `b`.
2. `b[j]` equals `a[1]` and the loop terminates with `j` pointing to the first occurrence of `a[1]` in `b`.

Given the constraints and the provided information, the most general final state is when the loop has either found a match or reached the end of the string `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is either `m` (if no match is found) or the index where `b[j] == a[1]` (if a match is found).**

In simpler terms, the loop will either find the first occurrence of `a[1]` in `b` and stop there, or it will reach the end of `b` without finding a match, and `j` will be equal to `m`.
