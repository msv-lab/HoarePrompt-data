Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input; `k` is 0; `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
        j += 1
    if j < m:
        k += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length m read from the input; `k` is 1 if `j` was less than `m` and has been incremented by 1, otherwise `k` is 0; `j` is equal to `m` if `j` was not less than `m`, otherwise `j` has been incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length m read from the input; `i` is 0. If `j` is less than `m` (indicating a match was found such that `b[j] == a[0]`), `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `j` is equal to `m` and `k` is set to 0, indicating no match was found.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input; `i` is 1. If a match is found for `b[j] == a[1]`, then `j` is the index where `b[j] == a[1]` plus 1 and `k` is increased by 1. If no match is found, then `j` is equal to `m`, indicating that no match was found for `b[j] == a[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
