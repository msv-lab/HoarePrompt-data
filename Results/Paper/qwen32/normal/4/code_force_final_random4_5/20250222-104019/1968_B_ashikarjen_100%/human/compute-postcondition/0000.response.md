The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` and `b` are binary strings of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
