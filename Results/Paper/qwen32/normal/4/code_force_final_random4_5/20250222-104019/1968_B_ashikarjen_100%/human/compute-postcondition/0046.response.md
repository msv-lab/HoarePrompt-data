Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input; `i` is 1. If a match is found for `b[j] == a[1]`, then `j` is the index where `b[j] == a[1]` plus 1 and `k` is increased by 1. If no match is found, then `j` is equal to `m`, indicating that no match was found for `b[j] == a[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
