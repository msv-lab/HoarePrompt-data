Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `costs` is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Given `n` is 0, this simplifies to `[-k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1) + (k - 1)`. Substituting `n = 0` into the formula, we get `0 // (-k + 1) + (k - 1)`. Since any number (except 0) divided by a non-zero number is an integer, `0 // (-k + 1)` is 0. Therefore, `h` simplifies to `0 + (k - 1)`, which is `k - 1`.
- It is mentioned that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. However, based on the calculation, `h` is `k - 1`, which is less than `k` unless `k` is 1. Given the range of `k`, this condition seems to be a constraint that may not hold true with the provided formula. Nonetheless, we will proceed with the calculation as given.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is simply:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement does not depend on any of the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h`. It directly prints the integer `2`.

### Output:
Output: **2**
