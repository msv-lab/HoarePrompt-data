The value of `h` is incremented by `curr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `curr`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is `n - k + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `curr`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is `n - k + 1`**.
