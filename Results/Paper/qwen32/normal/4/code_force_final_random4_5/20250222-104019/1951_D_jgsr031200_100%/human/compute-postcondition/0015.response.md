The code snippet provided is `n -= i * curr`. However, the initial state does not provide a defined value for `i` or `curr`. Since `i` and `curr` are undefined, we cannot compute the exact new value of `n`. Therefore, the state of `n` after the operation will be expressed in terms of `i` and `curr`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}.
- `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `costs` is a list containing the values `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is 0.
- `curr` is undefined due to `i` being undefined.

After executing `n -= i * curr`, the value of `n` will be `n - i * curr`. The values of `k`, `costs`, and `h` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is 0, `curr` is undefined, `i` is undefined.**
