The given initial state describes the values of `n` and `k` as positive integers within a specific range, and it specifies that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`.

The `print('YES')` statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **YES**
