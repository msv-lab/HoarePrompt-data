The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in the list `costs`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to examine the current state and how `i` changes.

Given:
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - k + 1`

This means that in the previous iteration, `i` took on the value of the first element in the `costs` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take on the value of the next element in the `costs` list.

Since `costs` has only two elements, the next value for `i` would be `1` (the second element in the list).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is `-n`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `curr`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is `1`**
