The code attempts to execute `h += curr`, but `curr` is undefined due to `i` being undefined. Since `curr` is not defined, the operation `h += curr` will result in a `NameError` in Python. However, following the instructions to the letter and considering that the variable states should be updated based on the code provided, we can infer that if `curr` were defined, it would be added to `h`. Since `curr` is not defined, `h` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}. n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list containing the values `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is 0. `curr` is undefined due to `i` being undefined.**
