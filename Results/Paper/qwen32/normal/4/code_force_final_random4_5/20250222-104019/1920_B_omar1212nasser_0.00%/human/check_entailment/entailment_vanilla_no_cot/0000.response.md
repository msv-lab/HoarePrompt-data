Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the general case for the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` has a hardcoded condition that only works for a specific case (when `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`), and it does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob in the general scenario.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The hardcoded condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3` is not a general solution and will fail for other test cases.
2. The approach to calculate the maximum possible sum is not optimal. The current implementation does not correctly consider the best way to remove elements and flip the signs of elements to achieve the desired outcome.
3. The logic for handling the removal and flipping operations does not correctly account for all possible scenarios, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the program, the logic should be revised to:
- Sort the array.
- Determine the optimal number of elements Alice should remove to maximize the sum.
- Determine the optimal number of elements Bob should flip to minimize the sum.
- Calculate the resulting sum based on the optimal actions of both players.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # Alice removes the smallest elements
    elements = elements[removals:]
    # Bob flips the smallest elements
    elements.sort()
    for i in range(min(negatives, len(elements))):
        if elements[i] < 0:
            elements[i] = -elements[i]
        else:
            break
    return sum(elements)

func_1()
```

This corrected version sorts the array, allows Alice to remove the smallest elements, and then allows Bob to flip the smallest remaining elements to minimize the sum. This approach ensures that both players play optimally.
