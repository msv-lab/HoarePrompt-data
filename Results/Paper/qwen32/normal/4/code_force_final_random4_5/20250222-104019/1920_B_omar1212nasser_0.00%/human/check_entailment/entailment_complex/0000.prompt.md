Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

# Annotated Functions:
func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is a positive integer representing the limit on the number of elements Alice can remove, x is a positive integer representing the limit on the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, a is a list of n positive integers representing the elements of the array.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: `n` is the first integer from the last input, `k` is the second integer from the last input, `x` is the third integer from the last input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the last input, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is `t - 1`, `product` is the value returned by `func_2(k, x, a)` for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of positive integers and two limits. It sorts the array and then calculates the maximum possible sum of the array elements after allowing Alice to remove up to a specified number of elements and Bob to multiply up to a specified number of elements by -1. The function outputs the maximum sum for each test case.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of integers.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of integers. It is not the case that removals is 6 and negatives is 3
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    n = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        try:
            n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
        except IndexError:
            n = 0
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * n)
        
    #State: pos contains `removals + 1` elements, where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * n` based on the updated `s` and `n` values from each iteration. If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` becomes 0, and the subsequent elements in `pos` are `s`.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, where `pos` contains `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * n` based on the updated `s` and `n` values from each iteration. If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` becomes 0, and the subsequent elements in `pos` are `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes three parameters: `removals` and `negatives` as non-negative integers, and `elements` as a list of integers. If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a list `pos` containing `removals + 1` elements, where each element is derived from the sum of `elements` and a modified sum of the last `negatives` elements. The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`. If an `IndexError` occurs during the calculation, the function sets `n` to 0 and continues, ensuring that subsequent elements in `pos` are equal to the sum of `elements`.
