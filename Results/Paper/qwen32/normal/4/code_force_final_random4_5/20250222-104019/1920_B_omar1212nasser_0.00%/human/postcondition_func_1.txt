The function `func_2` takes three parameters: `removals` and `negatives` as non-negative integers, and `elements` as a list of integers. If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a list `pos` containing `removals + 1` elements, where each element is derived from the sum of `elements` and a modified sum of the last `negatives` elements. The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`. If an `IndexError` occurs during the calculation, the function sets `n` to 0 and continues, ensuring that subsequent elements in `pos` are equal to the sum of `elements`.
