Output State: **`removals` is at least 5, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing three elements `s - 2 * n`, `s`, and `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-4]` minus `elements[-5]`, `n` is the updated sum of the last `negatives` elements plus `2 * elements[-(negatives + 4)] - 2 * elements[-4]`; otherwise, `n` is 0, `i` is 5.**

In simple terms, the value of `s` has been updated by subtracting `elements[-5]` from it. All other variables retain their previous states.
