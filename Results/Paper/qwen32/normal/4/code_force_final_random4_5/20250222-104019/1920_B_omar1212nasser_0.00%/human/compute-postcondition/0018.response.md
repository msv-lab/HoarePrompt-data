Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing three elements `s - 2 * n`, `s`, and `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-4]`. If no `IndexError` occurs, `n` is the updated sum of the last `negatives` elements plus `2 * elements[-(negatives + 4)] - 2 * elements[-4]`; otherwise, `n` is 0. `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The code appends `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Therefore, `pos` now contains three elements: the original two elements `s - 2 * n` and `s`, and the newly appended element `s - 2 * n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
