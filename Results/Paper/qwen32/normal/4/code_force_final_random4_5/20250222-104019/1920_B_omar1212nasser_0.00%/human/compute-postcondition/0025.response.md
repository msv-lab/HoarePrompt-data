To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers.
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `pos` is a list containing one element, `s - 2 * n`.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `elements`.
- `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs from `i = 1` to `removals` (inclusive). In each iteration:
- `s` is updated by subtracting the `i-th` last element of `elements`.
- `n` is updated by adding the element at position `-(negatives + i)` minus the element at position `-i` of `elements`, unless an `IndexError` occurs, in which case `n` becomes 0.
- `pos` appends the new value of `s - 2 * n`.

### Given Output States:
1. **After 1 iteration**:
   - `pos` contains two elements: `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * (n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1])]` or `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * 0]` if an `IndexError` occurs.
   
2. **After 2 iterations**:
   - `pos` contains three elements: `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * (n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]), s - 2 * (n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1] + elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2])]` or `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * 0, s - 2 * 0]` if `IndexError` occurs.
   
3. **After 3 iterations**:
   - `pos` contains four elements: `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * (n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]), s - 2 * (n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1] + elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2]), s - 2 * (n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1] + elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2] + elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3])]` or `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * 0, s - 2 * 0, s - 2 * 0]` if `IndexError` occurs.
   
### Final State:
After `removals` iterations, `pos` will contain `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` (except the first one) is calculated based on the updated `s` and `n` values from the previous iterations. If an `IndexError` occurs at any point, `n` becomes 0, and subsequent calculations of `s - 2 * n` will reflect this.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be:
- `pos` will have `removals + 1` elements.
- Each element in `pos` (except the first one) is calculated as `s - 2 * n` where `s` and `n` are updated in each iteration according to the loop logic.
- If an `IndexError` occurs at any point, `n` becomes 0, and the subsequent elements in `pos` will be `s`.

Given the pattern, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **pos contains `removals + 1` elements, where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * n` based on the updated `s` and `n` values from each iteration. If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` becomes 0, and the subsequent elements in `pos` are `s`.**

In simpler terms, the final `pos` list will have `removals + 1` elements, each representing the updated value of `s - 2 * n` after each iteration of the loop, with `n` potentially resetting to 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.
