The code snippet initializes an empty list named `pos`. This action does not affect the values of `removals`, `negatives`, or `elements`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `pos` list which is empty.

Output State: **removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of integers. It is not the case that removals is 6 and negatives is 3; `pos` is an empty list.**
