To determine the new value of `n` after the given code operation, we need to consider the expression `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `removals` is at least 1.
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer.
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-4]`.
- `n` is the updated sum of the last `negatives` elements plus `elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4]` if no `IndexError` occurs, or `n` is 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.
- `i` is 4.

The code snippet updates `n` by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]` to it. Since `i` is 4, this means we are looking at `elements[-(negatives + 4)]` and `elements[-4]`.

Let's denote the new value of `n` after the operation as `n_new`. The operation can be described as:
\[ n_{\text{new}} = n + (elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4]) \]

Given that `n` was previously defined as:
\[ n = \text{(sum of the last } negatives \text{ elements)} + elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4] \]

The new value of `n` after the operation is:
\[ n_{\text{new}} = n + (elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4]) \]
\[ n_{\text{new}} = \left(\text{(sum of the last } negatives \text{ elements)} + elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4]\right) + (elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4]) \]
\[ n_{\text{new}} = \text{(sum of the last } negatives \text{ elements)} + 2 \cdot elements[-(negatives + 4)] - 2 \cdot elements[-4] \]

Therefore, the updated value of `n` is:
\[ n_{\text{new}} = \text{(sum of the last } negatives \text{ elements)} + 2 \cdot elements[-(negatives + 4)] - 2 \cdot elements[-4] \]

The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing two elements `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-4]`, `n` is the updated sum of the last `negatives` elements plus `2 * elements[-(negatives + 4)] - 2 * elements[-4]` if no `IndexError` occurs, or `n` is 0 if an `IndexError` occurs, `i` is 4.**
