Output State: **`ans` is initially `m` multiplied by the number of characters in `p` ('ABCDEFG') that are not in `hmp`, plus `m - hmp[i]`; `hmp` must contain at least one item. The current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its previous value. The conditions about `hmp` and its items remain unchanged.
