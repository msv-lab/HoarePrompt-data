The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the keys in the dictionary `hmp`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next key in `hmp`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `next_key`, which is the current key being processed.
- `hmp` must contain at least one item.
- `ans` is calculated based on the values in `hmp` and the string `p`.

Since `i` is the key being processed in the current iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next key in `hmp`. Let's denote the next key as `next_next_key`.

State: **`ans` is initially `m` multiplied by the number of characters in `p` ('ABCDEFG') that are not in `hmp`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. `hmp` must contain at least one item, and `i` is `next_next_key` where `next_next_key` is the next key in `hmp`.**
