The code snippet updates the values of `n` and `m` by reading two integers from the input. The initial values of `n` and `m` are overwritten by the new input values. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `p`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 18, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is the string from the input, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, and `ans` is `3 * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`**

In simpler terms: The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the first and second integers from the input, respectively. All other variables retain their initial values.
