The code snippet `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `s` is a string input by the user; `ans` is `m`; `p` is 'ABCDEFG'; `hmp` is a Counter object representing the character counts in `s`. The character `i` is not in `hmp`.**
