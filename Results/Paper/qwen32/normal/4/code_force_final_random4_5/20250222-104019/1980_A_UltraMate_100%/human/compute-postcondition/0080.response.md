The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the keys of the dictionary `hmp`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on a value that corresponds to one of the keys in `hmp`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be updated to the next key in `hmp`.

Since the specific keys of `hmp` are not provided, we can only say that `i` should be the next key in the iteration order of `hmp`.

State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged. `i` is the next key in `hmp` for the next iteration.**
