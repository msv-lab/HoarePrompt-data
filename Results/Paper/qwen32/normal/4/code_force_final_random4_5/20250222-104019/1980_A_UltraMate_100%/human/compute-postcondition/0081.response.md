The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `m - hmp[i]` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged, and `i` is still the next key in `hmp` for the next iteration.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged; `i` is the next key in `hmp` for the next iteration; `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`.**
