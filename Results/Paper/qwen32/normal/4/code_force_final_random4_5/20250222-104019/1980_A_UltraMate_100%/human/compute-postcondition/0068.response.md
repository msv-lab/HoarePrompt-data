Postcondition: **`t` is 18, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is the new string from the input, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object with the character counts of `s`. If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `0`.**
