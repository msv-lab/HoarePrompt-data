The only variable in the loop head is `t`, as the loop iterates `_` times, which is a throwaway variable. The state of `t` determines how many more times the loop can execute.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed 18 times. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must be greater than 18. Since the loop has already run 18 times, the initial value of `t` must have been at least 18. After 18 iterations, `t` would have been decremented to 0 if it was exactly 18, or it would be 19 if it started at 19, allowing for one more iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be 19 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **18. `t` is 19**
