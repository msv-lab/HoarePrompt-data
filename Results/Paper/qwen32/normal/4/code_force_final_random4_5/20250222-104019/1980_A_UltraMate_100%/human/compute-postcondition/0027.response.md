Postcondition: **`ans` is initially `m` multiplied by the number of characters in `p` ('ABCDEFG') that are not in `hmp`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. `hmp` must contain at least one item, and `i` is `next_next_key` where `next_next_key` is the next key in `hmp`.**
