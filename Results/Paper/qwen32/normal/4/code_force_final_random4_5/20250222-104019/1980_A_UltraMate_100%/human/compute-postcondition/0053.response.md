Postcondition: **`t` is 19, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current one. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
