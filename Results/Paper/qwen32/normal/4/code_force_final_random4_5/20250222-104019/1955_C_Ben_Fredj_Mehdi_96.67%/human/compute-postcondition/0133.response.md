Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **`t`** is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`a`** is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
3. **`z`** is updated by adding 1 to its current value (`z = z + 1`).

### Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print('10000')
```

### Analysis
The print statement directly prints the string `'10000'`. This string is hardcoded and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `z`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, and `z` do not influence the output of this print statement.

### Conclusion
The print statement will output the string `'10000'`.

### Final Output
Output: **10000**
