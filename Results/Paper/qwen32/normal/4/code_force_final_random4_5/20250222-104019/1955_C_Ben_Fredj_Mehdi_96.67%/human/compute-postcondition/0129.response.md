The `print('99')` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `a`, or `z` as described in the initial state. The string `'99'` is explicitly provided as an argument to the `print` function.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes `t` as an integer between 1 and 10,000, `a` as a list of integers from new input, and `z` as `z + 1`. However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('99')`, which means it will output the string `'99'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, or `z`.

Therefore, the output is simply the string `'99'`.

Output: **99**
