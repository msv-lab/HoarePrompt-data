Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string. If `k` equals 3000000000, no changes are made to `a`. Otherwise, if `k` >= sum(a), no changes are made to `a` except that `z` is incremented by 1. If `k` < sum(a), the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1. If `k` is odd, the element at index `g` is decremented by an additional 1. `g` is incremented by the number of leading zeros encountered and decremented; `d` is decremented by the number of trailing zeros encountered and decremented; and `i` is `k // 2`.**
