Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `g` is decremented by 1 and the element at index `d` is decremented by 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space, `k` is at least 2, `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` was 0, `d` is updated to `len(a) - 3` if the element at index `d` was 0, otherwise, `d` remains `len(a) - 2` if the last element of `a` was 0, and `len(a) - 1` otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.**
