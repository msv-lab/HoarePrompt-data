Let's analyze the provided initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting an input string by spaces and converting each part to an integer.
- `n` and `k` retain their initial values, but specific values are not provided for them in the initial state.
- `k` is not equal to 1999999998 and `k` is not equal to 1999999999.
- The current value of `k` is 99999999999.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('99')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'99'`. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k` do not affect this particular print statement because the statement is hardcoded to print the string `'99'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply `'99'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **99**
