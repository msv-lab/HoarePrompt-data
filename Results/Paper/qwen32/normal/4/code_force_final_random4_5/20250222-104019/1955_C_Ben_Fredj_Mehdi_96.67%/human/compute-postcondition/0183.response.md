Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers. If `k` >= the sum of `a`, then `z` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the first `k // 2` and last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1. If `k` is an odd integer, `a[g]` (where `g` points to the first non-zero element) is also decremented by 1, and `z` is incremented by `k // 2`.**
