Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `a` is a list of integers obtained from new input.
3. `z` is `z + 1`. However, there is no initial value of `z` provided, and it seems `z` is not used in the print statement.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('1')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('1')`. This statement explicitly prints the string `'1'`.

### Variables and Objects:
- `t`, `a`, and `z` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly prints the string `'1'`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is printing the string `'1'` directly, the output will be the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
