The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'99'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state (`t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, `k`). The print statement is hardcoded to output the string `'99'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'99'`.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'99'`.

Output: **99**
