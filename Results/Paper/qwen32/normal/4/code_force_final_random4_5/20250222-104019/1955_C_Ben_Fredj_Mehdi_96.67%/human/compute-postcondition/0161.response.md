Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the first element `a[g]` has been decreased by 1, `z` is `z + 1`, `d` is `len(a) - 1` if `a[d]` is not 0 after the decrement, otherwise `d` is `len(a) - 2`, `k` is at least 2, and `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` becomes 0, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The first element of the list `a` at index `g` has been decreased by 1. The value of `z` has been incremented by 1. The value of `d` remains `len(a) - 1` unless `a[d]` becomes 0 after the decrement, in which case `d` becomes `len(a) - 2`. The value of `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` becomes 0. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged unless `a[g]` becomes 0, in which case `g` is incremented.
