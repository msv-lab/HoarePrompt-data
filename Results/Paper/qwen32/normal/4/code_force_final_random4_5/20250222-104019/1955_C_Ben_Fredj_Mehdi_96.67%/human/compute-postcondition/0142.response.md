In the given task, the initial state describes several variables and their properties, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is printing a simple string, `'5'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, or `z` described in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown of the relevant information:
- `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers from a new input.
- `z` is incremented by 1 (`z = z + 1`), but its exact value is not relevant to the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('5')
```
This statement explicitly prints the string `'5'`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, or `z`, the output of the `print` statement will always be the string `'5'`.

Output: **5**
