Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting an input string by spaces and converting each part to an integer; `n` and `k` retain their initial values; `k` is not equal to 1999999998, `k` is not equal to 1999999999, `k` is not equal to 99999999999; either `n` is not equal to 1, or `k` is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of `a` is not 1; `k` is not equal to 9999999999; it is not the case that `n` is equal to 101 and `k` is equal to 100000000000; `k` is not equal to 10000000000000; `k` is not equal to 99999999999999; `k` is not equal to 199999999999999; `k` is not equal to 1000000000000; and `k` is not equal to 200000000000; either `k` is not equal to 2147483648 or `n` is not equal to 2; it is not the case that `n` is equal to 2 and `k` is equal to 1000000000 and `a` is equal to [1000000000, 1000000000]; it is not the case that `n` is equal to 5 and `k` is equal to 2147483648; and it is not the case that `n` is equal to 20 and `k` is equal to 10000000000; `k` is not equal to 5999999999; and `k` is not equal to 4294967295; it is not the case that `n` is equal to 2 and `k` is equal to `a[0] - 1` and `k` is equal to `a[1] - 2`; `k` is not equal to 3000000000`; and `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`; `d` is equal to `len(a) - 1`; `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` retain their initial values; `a` is a list of integers where the first element is `a[0] - 1` and the last element is `a[d] - 1` if `a[d]` is not 0, otherwise `a[d]` is 0; `d` is equal to `len(a) - 1` if `a[d]` is not 0, otherwise `d` is equal to `len(a) - 2`; `g` is 0 if `a[g]` (which is `a[0]`) is not 0, otherwise `g` is 1; if an exception occurs, the state is unknown, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` retain their initial values; `a` is a list of integers where the first non-zero element `a[g]` is `a[g] - 1`, and the last element is `a[d] - 1` if `a[d]` was not 0, otherwise `a[d]` is -1; `d` is equal to `len(a) - 2` if `a[d]` was 0, otherwise `d` is equal to `len(a) - 1`; `g` is 1 if `a[0]` is 0, otherwise `g` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` retain their initial values; `a` is a list of integers where the first non-zero element `a[g]` is `a[g] - 2`, and the last element is `a[d] - 2` if `a[d]` was not 0, otherwise `a[d]` is -1; `d` is equal to `len(a) - 3` if `a[d]` was 0, otherwise `d` is equal to `len(a) - 2`; `g` is 2 if `a[0]` is 0 and `a[g]` was 0, otherwise `g` is 1; `i` is `i + 1`. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
