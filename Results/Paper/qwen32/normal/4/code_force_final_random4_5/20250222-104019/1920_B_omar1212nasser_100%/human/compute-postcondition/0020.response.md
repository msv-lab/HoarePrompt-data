Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `s` is reduced by `elements[-i]`, `s2` is reduced by `elements[-i]` and then increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)]`.**

In natural language: The value of `s2` is updated by first reducing it by `elements[-i]` and then increasing it by `elements[-(negatives + i)]`. All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their described states and relationships.
