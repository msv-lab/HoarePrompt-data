The code snippet calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements of the `elements` list and assigns it to the variable `s2`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). `elements` is a list of integers. `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`. `s` is the sum of `elements`. `s2` is the sum of `elements[-negatives:]`.**
