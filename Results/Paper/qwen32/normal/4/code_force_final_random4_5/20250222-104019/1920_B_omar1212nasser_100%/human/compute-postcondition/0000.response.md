The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `pos`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `pos` while keeping the preconditions for `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` intact.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). `elements` is a list of integers. `pos` is an empty list.**
