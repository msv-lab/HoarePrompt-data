Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `s` is reduced by `elements[-i]`, `s2` is reduced by `elements[-i]`.**

In simple terms: The value of `s2` is decreased by the value of `elements[-i]`. All other variables retain their previous states described in the initial conditions, except for `s2`, which has been updated.
