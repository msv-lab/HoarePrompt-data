Postcondition: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `s` is reduced by `elements[-i]`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)]`.**
