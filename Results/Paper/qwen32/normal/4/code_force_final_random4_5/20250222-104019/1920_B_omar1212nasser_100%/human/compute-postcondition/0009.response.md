Postcondition: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s` is the sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]` and `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`. Otherwise, `s` and `s2` remain unchanged.**
