Postcondition: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]`, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i]`, and it is true that `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`.**
