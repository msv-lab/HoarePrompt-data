Postcondition: **The loop runs for a total number of times specified by the initial integer input. After all iterations, `b` will be the last string input by the user. `k` will contain the counts of '1's from each string `b` that contained '1' during the loop iterations. At this point, the count of '1's in the first element of `k` is equal to the count of '1's in the second element of `k`.**
