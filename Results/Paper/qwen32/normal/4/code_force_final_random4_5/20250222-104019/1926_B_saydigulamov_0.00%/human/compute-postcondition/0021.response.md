The code snippet `k = []` reassigns the variable `k` to an empty list. This means the previous list containing the counts of '1's from all input strings `b` that contained '1' is discarded, and `k` is now an empty list. The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `b` is the last string input by the user, `k` is an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1.**
