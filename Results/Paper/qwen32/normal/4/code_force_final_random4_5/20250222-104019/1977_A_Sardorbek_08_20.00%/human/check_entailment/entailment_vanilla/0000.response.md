Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the given description.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of moves:
1. Adding exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Removing exactly 1 cube from the tower.

We need to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations:
- If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`.
- If `n` is equal to `m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes by adding a cube in each of the `n` moves.
- If `n` is greater than `m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because we can add cubes to reach `m` and then remove cubes in pairs to reach the exact number `m`.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided code:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line is redundant and can be removed
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:  # This condition is incorrect
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Redundant Line**: The line `q = (b, c)` is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the output.
2. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2` is incorrect. The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, not the number of moves for the current test case. The correct condition should be checking the parity of `b` (number of moves) and `c` (desired number of cubes).

### Correct Condition:
The correct condition should be `elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:`. This checks if the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for the problem.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect condition used to determine if the number of cubes can be `m` after `n` moves.

**Correctness: False**
