### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine if it is possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move is either adding or removing exactly one cube.
- **Key Insight**: The difference `n - m` must be even and non-negative because each pair of one addition and one removal cancels out two moves.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `b` (number of moves) and `c` (desired number of cubes).
- It prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`.
- It prints 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`.
- It checks if both `a` and `b` have the same parity to print 'Yes' if true, otherwise 'No'.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Incorrect Variable Usage**:
   - The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` uses `a` (number of test cases) instead of `b` (number of moves) and `c` (desired number of cubes). This is incorrect.
   - The correct condition should check if `b` and `c` have the same parity and ensure `b >= c`.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The logic for determining whether it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves is incorrect. The correct condition should be based on whether `b` (number of moves) is at least `c` (desired number of cubes) and whether the difference `b - c` is even.

#### Corrected Logic:
- **Condition**: If `b >= c` and `(b - c) % 2 == 0`, then it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
3
3 3
2 4
5 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Yes
No
Yes
```

**Actual Output with Corrected Logic:**
- For `3 3`: `b = 3`, `c = 3`. Since `b == c`, the output should be "Yes".
- For `2 4`: `b = 2`, `c = 4`. Since `b < c`, the output should be "No".
- For `5 3`: `b = 5`, `c = 3`. Since `b >= c` and `(b - c) % 2 == 0`, the output should be "Yes".

The original program incorrectly outputs "No" for the third test case because of the incorrect parity check involving `a`.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the identified issues and the corrected logic, the original program is indeed incorrect.

**Final: **False**
