Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that a >= 1, `b` and `c` are integers read from the input, `q` is a tuple containing the current values of `b` and `c`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `b < c`, the program follows the if part; otherwise, it follows the else part where `i` is incremented by an additional 1.**

This can be simplified to:

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that a >= 1, `b` and `c` are integers read from the input, `q` is a tuple containing the current values of `b` and `c`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `b >= c`, `i` is incremented by an additional 1.**
