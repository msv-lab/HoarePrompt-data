Reasoning:
The given program has some logical errors based on the problem description. Let's break down the conditions and the program's logic.

1. **If `b == c`:** The program correctly prints 'YES' because if the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.

2. **If `b < c`:** The program correctly prints 'NO' because if the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it's impossible to end up with `c` cubes since the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `b`.

3. **Checking Parity:** The program incorrectly checks the parity of `a` (the number of test cases) and `b` (the number of moves) to determine if the final number of cubes `m` can be achieved. The correct condition is to check the parity of `b` (the number of moves) and `c` (the desired number of cubes). This is because the difference `b - c` must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because adding or removing one cube each time means the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of cubes will change with each move. Therefore, the difference in parity between `b` and `c` must be zero for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes.

The program incorrectly uses `a % 2 == b % 2` instead of `b % 2 == c % 2`. This mistake means that the program might incorrectly determine the possibility of achieving the desired number of cubes based on the number of test cases rather than the number of moves.

Correctness: **False**
