You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, there are two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that a >= 1, `b` and `c` are integers read from the input during the last iteration, `q` is a tuple (`b`, `c`) from the last iteration, and `i` equals `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. It then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and checks if both `a` and `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd) to print 'Yes' if true, otherwise 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
Nikita can either add or remove one cube from the tower in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves starting from 0 cubes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity (Odd/Even) Insight**: 
    - If `n` is even, the final number of cubes `m` must also be even or odd depending on the initial state (which is 0, even). Thus, `m` must be even if `n` is even.
    - If `n` is odd, `m` must be odd for the same reason.

2. **Basic Conditions**:
    - If `n == m`, it's trivially possible.
    - If `n < m`, it's impossible because the maximum number of cubes you can have after `n` moves is `n`.

### Program Analysis:
Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line does nothing and can be removed
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:  # Incorrect condition, should be b % 2 == c % 2
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Unused Variable**: `q = (b, c)` is unnecessary and does not affect the logic.
2. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. It should check the parity of `b` (number of moves) and `c` (desired number of cubes) instead of `a` (number of test cases). The correct condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`.

### Correct Condition Explanation:
- If `b == c`, print 'YES' (trivial case).
- If `b < c`, print 'NO' (impossible to have more cubes than moves).
- If `b % 2 == c % 2`, print 'YES' (parity matches, so it's possible).
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`. It should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`.

Correctness: **False**
