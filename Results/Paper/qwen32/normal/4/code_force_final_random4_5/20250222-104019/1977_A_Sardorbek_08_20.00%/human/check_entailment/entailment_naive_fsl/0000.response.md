Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description.

1. **Incorrect Variable Usage**:
   - In the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`, the variable `a` is used, which represents the number of test cases, not the number of moves `b` or the number of cubes `c`. This condition should instead use `b` and `c` to check if the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves `b` is the same as the number of cubes `c`.

2. **Case Sensitivity**:
   - The problem description states that the output can be in any case (lowercase or uppercase). However, the program uses both 'Yes' and 'YES' interchangeably, which is fine, but the issue lies in the incorrect logic rather than the case sensitivity.

3. **Logic Error**:
   - The logic for determining whether it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves is incorrect. The correct condition should be based on whether `n` is at least `m` and whether the difference `n - m` is even (since each pair of one addition and one removal cancels out two moves).

Let's consider a specific case to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Yes
```

**Actual Output:**
```
No
```

Explanation for the incorrect output:
- In the given input, `n = 5` and `m = 3`.
- The difference `n - m = 2`, which is even.
- According to the problem, it is possible to have 3 cubes after 5 moves (e.g., add 3 cubes and then remove 2 cubes).
- However, the program incorrectly outputs "No" because the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2` is not correctly checking the parity of `b` and `c`.

Here is the corrected logic:
- If `b >= m` and `(b - m) % 2 == 0`, then it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect due to these issues.
