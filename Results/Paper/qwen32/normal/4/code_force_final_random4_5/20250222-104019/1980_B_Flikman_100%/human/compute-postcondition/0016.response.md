Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, `k` are the three integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is incremented by 1.**
