Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `f`, `k` <= `n` <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    removed_count = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
            removed_count += 1
    favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
    if removed_count == favorite_count:
        print('YES')
    elif removed_count == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `f`, `k` are the three integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list `a`; `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`; `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, then `removed_count` remains equal to `favorite_count`. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`. If `removed_count` is 0, it remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order, `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire `sorted_a` list. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, the program does not perform any additional actions in the if block. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order, `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire `sorted_a` list. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, then `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count` and if `removed_count` is greater than 0, it indicates that `favorite_value` appears more times in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a` than in the rest of the list. If `removed_count` is 0, it indicates that `favorite_value` does not appear in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
