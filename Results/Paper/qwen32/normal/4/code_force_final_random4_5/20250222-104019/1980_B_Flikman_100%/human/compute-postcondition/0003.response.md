The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `f`, `k` are the three integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
