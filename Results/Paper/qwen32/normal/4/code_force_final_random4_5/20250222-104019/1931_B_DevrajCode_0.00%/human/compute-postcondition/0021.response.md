Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9 and the sum of a_i is divisible by n). The function returns 'No' in four different cases, and 'Yes' in one specific case. However, based on the provided output, the function always returns 'No' regardless of the input values.**
