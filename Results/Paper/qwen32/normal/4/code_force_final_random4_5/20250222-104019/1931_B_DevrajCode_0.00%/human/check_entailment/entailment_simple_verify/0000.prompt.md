You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`; `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, and `total_water % n` equals 0.
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: `container` is 0.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The error lies in the logic that checks if the cumulative difference (`container`) becomes negative at any point, which is not a correct condition to determine the possibility of equalizing the water levels.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

### Counterexample:
Input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
3
3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
NO
```

### Explanation of the Error:
- For the second test case (`a = [3, 2, 1]`), the program calculates the cumulative difference as follows:
  - `container = 3 - 2 = 1`
  - `container = 1 + (2 - 2) = 1`
  - `container = 1 + (1 - 2) = 0`
  - The cumulative difference never goes negative, so the program returns "YES".

- However, it's possible to equalize the water levels:
  - Pour 1 unit of water from the first container to the third container, resulting in `[2, 2, 2]`.

The issue arises because the program only checks if the cumulative difference goes negative, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels. The correct approach would involve checking if the prefix sums can be adjusted to match the target value without violating the constraints.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that at no point does the cumulative difference become negative, and that the final cumulative difference is zero. However, the current logic does not correctly handle all cases where equalization is possible.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
