Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. The logic in the function `func_1` is based on a key observation: if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the target water level (which is the total water divided by the number of containers) never goes negative as we iterate through the containers, then it is possible to redistribute the water. This is because a negative cumulative difference would imply that we would need to take water from a container that has not yet been considered, which is not allowed by the problem constraints (water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to one with a higher index).

However, there is a critical issue with the provided code: the function `func_1` is called before it is defined. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called. Therefore, the code as written will result in a `NameError` due to the function `func_1` not being recognized when it is called.

To correct this, the function definition should be moved above the point where the function is called. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import sys

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    a = list(map(int, data[index+1:index+1+n]))
    results.append(func_1(n, a))
    index += 1 + n
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

In this corrected version, the function `func_1` is defined before it is used, and the input handling is adjusted to process multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False** (due to the function call before definition)  
Correctness: **True** (after correcting the function call order and handling multiple test cases)
