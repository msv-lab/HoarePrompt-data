The code snippet simply initializes a new variable `container` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, or `target`. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new variable `container`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, and `total_water % n` equals 0; `target` is `total_water // n`; `container` is 0.**
