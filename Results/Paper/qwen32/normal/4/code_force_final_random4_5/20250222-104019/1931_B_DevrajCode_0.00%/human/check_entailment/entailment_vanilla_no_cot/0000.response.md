Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the input format as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it reads all the input at once and processes it as a single block, which is not the intended way to handle multiple test cases. Each test case should be processed independently.

Here is a corrected version of the program that reads and processes each test case separately:

```python
import sys

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This version of the program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, storing the results and printing them at the end.
