Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The error lies in the logic that checks if the cumulative difference (`container`) becomes negative at any point, which is not a correct condition to determine the possibility of equalizing the water levels.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

### Counterexample:
Input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
3
3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
NO
```

### Explanation of the Error:
- For the second test case (`a = [3, 2, 1]`), the program calculates the cumulative difference as follows:
  - `container = 3 - 2 = 1`
  - `container = 1 + (2 - 2) = 1`
  - `container = 1 + (1 - 2) = 0`
  - The cumulative difference never goes negative, so the program returns "YES".

- However, it's possible to equalize the water levels:
  - Pour 1 unit of water from the first container to the third container, resulting in `[2, 2, 2]`.

The issue arises because the program only checks if the cumulative difference goes negative, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels. The correct approach would involve checking if the prefix sums can be adjusted to match the target value without violating the constraints.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that at no point does the cumulative difference become negative, and that the final cumulative difference is zero. However, the current logic does not correctly handle all cases where equalization is possible.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
