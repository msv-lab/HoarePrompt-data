Reasoning:
The given problem requires determining if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, with the restriction that water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by following these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
2. For each test case, it calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water each container should have (which is the total water divided by the number of containers).
3. It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a running balance (`container`) of the difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the target amount.
4. If at any point this running balance becomes negative, it returns 'No', indicating that it's not possible to equalize the water levels with the given constraints.
5. If the loop completes without the balance going negative, it returns 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to equalize the water levels.

However, there are a few issues with the provided program:
1. The function `func_1` is defined after it is called, which will result in a `NameError`.
2. The program reads all input at once and assumes the first value is the number of test cases, followed by the details of all test cases. This is not how the input is structured according to the problem description. The number of test cases is followed by the details of each test case, which should be processed separately.
3. The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It only processes the first test case and then encounters an error due to the function definition being placed after its call.

To fix the program, we need to:
- Ensure the function `func_1` is defined before it is called.
- Process each test case separately.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
import sys

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    a = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))
    results.append(func_1(n, a))
    index += 1 + n

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

Given the original program, the logic for determining the possibility of equalizing the water levels is correct, but the input handling and function placement are incorrect. Therefore, the original program is not correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
