The only object in the loop head is the variable `water`, which iterates over the list `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether there are more elements in the list `a` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `water` held the value of the last element in the list `a`.

To execute one more time, `water` needs to take the value of the next element in the list `a` if there are any remaining elements.

Given that the loop iterates over all elements in the list `a`, the state at the start of the next iteration will involve `water` taking the value of the next element in the list. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, and `container`) do not change their values in the loop head.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, `total_water % n` equals 0, `target` is `total_water // n`, `container` is `container` + (`water` - `target`), and `container` is not less than 0, `water` is the next element in the list `a`**
