### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine if it is possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount of water. The program follows these steps:

1. It calculates the total amount of water, `total_water`, and checks if it is divisible by `n`. Since the problem guarantees that `total_water` is divisible by `n`, this check is redundant but does not affect correctness.

2. It calculates the `target` amount of water that each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.

3. It then iterates through the list of containers, maintaining a `container` variable that tracks the net balance of water as it redistributes. For each container, it adjusts the `container` variable by the difference between the current container's water and the `target`. 

4. If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means that the redistribution process would require water to be taken from a container that already has less than the target amount, which is not possible according to the problem constraints (you can only pour water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`). In this case, the program returns 'No'.

5. If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it means that the water can be redistributed to meet the target amount in each container, and the program returns 'Yes'.

The logic seems correct based on the problem description. The program correctly checks if it's possible to redistribute the water without violating the constraints, and it returns the appropriate 'Yes' or 'No' based on this check.
