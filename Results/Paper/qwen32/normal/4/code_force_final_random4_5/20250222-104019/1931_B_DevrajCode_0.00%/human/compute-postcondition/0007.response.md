The code snippet `container += water - target` modifies the value of `container` by adding the difference between `water` and `target` to it. The variables `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` remain unchanged. Since `water` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `water` is a variable that holds some integer value. The new value of `container` will be the sum of its previous value and `water - target`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, `total_water % n` equals 0, `target` is `total_water // n`, `container` is `container` + (`water` - `target`)**
In simple terms, the output state is: `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `total_water` remains the same, `target` remains the same, and `container` is updated to its previous value plus the difference between `water` and `target`.
