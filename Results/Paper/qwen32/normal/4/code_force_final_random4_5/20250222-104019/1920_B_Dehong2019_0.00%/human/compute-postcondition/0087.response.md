The given code snippet modifies `ans1` by subtracting `a[i + x] * 2` from it. Let's break down the changes and provide the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-2 ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `x` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input
- `i` is `x + 1`
- `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 4` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 3 * a[i]`
- `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`
- `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop
- `k` is greater than 0

Code to execute:
```
ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
```

Impact of the code:
- `ans1` is updated by subtracting `a[i + x] * 2` from its current value.

Given the initial definition of `ans1`, if `i + x` is less than `n`, the new `ans1` will be:
`sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 4 - a[i + x] * 2`
Simplifying, we get:
`sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 6`

If `i + x` is not less than `n`, `ans1` was initially:
`sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 3 * a[i]`
Since `i + x` is not less than `n`, subtracting `a[i + x] * 2` would not change the value of `ans1` as `a[i + x]` is not part of the initial definition. However, the code still attempts to subtract `a[i + x] * 2`, which means `ans1` will be:
`sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 3 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 2`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-2 ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `x` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `x + 1`; `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 6` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 3 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 2`; `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop; `k` is greater than 0.**
