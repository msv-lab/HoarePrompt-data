The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state of these variables is not specified, but after the execution of the code, their values will be the integers read from the input. The other variables like `t`, `a`, `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `ans` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains `n` integers sorted in descending order where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `i` is `k-1`; `ans1` is the value after `k` iterations of the loop; `ans2` is the value of `ans1` from the last iteration; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop. `n`, `k`, and `x` have been updated to the values read from the input.**
