The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` adds the value of `a[i]` to the variable `ans1`. Given that `a` is an array of integers sorted in descending order, and `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, the value of `a[i]` will be added to `ans1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains `n` integers sorted in descending order where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`.**
