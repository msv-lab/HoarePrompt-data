To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand how the variables `ans1`, `ans2`, and `ans` are calculated based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n.
- `a` is an array of `n` integers sorted in descending order where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000.
- `i` is set to `k-1`.
- `ans1` is the value after `k` iterations of the loop.
- `ans2` is the value of `ans1` from the last iteration.
- `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop.

### Analysis:
- `i` is set to `k-1`, meaning it points to the `k`-th element in the array `a` (since indexing starts from 0).
- `ans1` is the value after `k` iterations of the loop. This suggests that the loop is iterating `k` times and `ans1` is being updated in each iteration.
- `ans2` holds the value of `ans1` from the previous iteration.
- `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop.

### Loop Analysis:
Without the exact loop code, we can infer the following:
- The loop likely processes elements of the array `a` and updates `ans1` based on some condition or calculation.
- `ans2` is updated to the previous value of `ans1` at the start of each iteration.
- `ans` keeps track of the maximum value seen between `ans1` and `ans2` during the loop.

### Conclusion:
Given the above, the final value printed by `print(ans)` will be the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the `k` iterations of the loop. Since the exact loop logic is not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe it as the maximum value observed between `ans1` and `ans2` during the loop.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value of ans1 and ans2 observed during the k iterations of the loop)**
