Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to vertices.
- We need to add edges between pairs (i, j) if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k.
- We need to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

### Analysis of Provided Functions:

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`:
- This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
- It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n` with 0s.
- It then calls `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)` for each clique.
- Finally, it prints the `arr` (which should contain the distinct integers assigned to vertices), the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array (which should indicate the clique number for each vertex).

#### Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`:
- This function fills a segment of the `arr` array from `left` to `right` with specific values.
- The first half of the segment is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`.
- The second half of the segment is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`.
- It also sets the `clique` number for each position in the segment in the `cliquess` array.

### Issues in the Implementation:

1. **Assignment of Distinct Integers:**
   - The function `make_array` fills the `arr` array with values such that the first half is increasing and the second half is decreasing. However, this does not guarantee that all integers from 1 to n are used exactly once. For example, if `n` is not a multiple of `k`, the last segment might not cover all remaining integers.

2. **Edge Condition Handling:**
   - The condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k must be satisfied for all pairs (i, j) within the same clique. The current implementation does not ensure this condition is met because the assignment of integers in `arr` is not necessarily such that the edge condition holds for all pairs.

3. **Clique Formation:**
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, but the actual partitioning into cliques based on the edge condition is not verified. The `make_array` function does not check if the assigned integers ensure that all pairs within a clique satisfy the edge condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. The assignment of integers and the partitioning into cliques are not guaranteed to meet the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**

The implementation needs to ensure that:
- All integers from 1 to n are used exactly once.
- The edge condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k is satisfied for all pairs within the same clique.
- The graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
